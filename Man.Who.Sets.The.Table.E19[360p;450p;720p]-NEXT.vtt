1
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.340
250,000 dollars?

2
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.880
Renting or buying a house
 practically costs the same.

3
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.550
(Episode 19)

4
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.280
What are you concentrating on so much?

5
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.680
What else?

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.690
I'm trying to find a place for 
So Won to live after he gets out.

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.760
Why are you already searching? 
We only talked about it a while ago.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.990
I keep getting mad and bitter 
whenever I think about it.

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.460
She's just an old lady 
who is crazy about hats.

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.680
She's rich, but she has no mercy.

11
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.300
What did So Won do so wrong?

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.320
Frankly speaking, 
if a woman has a baby in secret,

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.880
how would a man know?

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.680
Stop it. It will only disgrace you.

15
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.410
How will it disgrace me?

16
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.580
If it was me,

17
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.490
I would've gladly accepted Han Gyul.

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.170
Honestly, her daughter can't have a baby.

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.280
Isn't this good news for her?

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.060
Having a baby and raising it isn't easy.

21
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000
If they just accept Han Gyul,

22
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.020
she won't have to go through
 the pain of birth...

23
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.930
and raising a baby.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.320
Moreover,

25
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.520
women lose their figures 
after having birth.

26
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.710
She won't have to worry 
about stretch marks on her belly.

27
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.680
Are you serious?

28
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.250
Try to think it in your shoes.

29
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.500
What would you do if this
 happened to Ru Ri?

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.550
What? Why would you use 
my daughter as an example?

31
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.710
I'm really good at judging 
people's character.

32
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.860
I won't let a punk like that marry her.

33
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.450
Then according to your logic, 
So Won is that punk.

34
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.670
- Try to understand Mrs. Yang.
 - Be quiet. Be quiet.

35
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.270
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

36
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.830
You pretend to be the most 
conscious person...

37
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.850
and the most upright person.

38
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.920
If you were that great,

39
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.320
why would you be here cooking?

40
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.290
Why didn't you become a politician after passing hearings?

41
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.630
If I can be born again,

42
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.630
I'll never become your wife again. Keep that in mind.

43
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.720
Really?

44
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.870
I also won't marry you.

45
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.020
Why are you fighting so early in the morning?

46
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.260
So Won, you came at the right timing.

47
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.840
Let's go look at houses.

48
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.040
- Houses? - Yes.

49
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.730
You know how hard it is to rent a house in Seoul these days, right?

50
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.850
I found an appropriate house. Let's hurry.

51
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.420
I need to move my stuff from the hospital today.

52
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.960
Mom, can you go instead of me?

53
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.420
I don't want to.

54
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880
I can't go anywhere because I need to take care of Han Gyul.

55
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.390
What's the point of going with him anyway?

56
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.630
He'll just decide by himself.

57
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.740
I have a lot of other people to go with even if you're not going.

58
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.840
That woman is always angry.

59
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.040
Why is her temper getting so bad?

60
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.010
Gosh.

61
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.960
Mother, what are you doing here?

62
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.900
I'm here to talk with you for the last time.

63
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.600
About what?

64
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.090
Isn't this you when you were young?

65
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.230
Who is this child?

66
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.270
It's my son.

67
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.770
His name is Ha Eun Jo.

68
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.670
Your son?

69
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.980
Did Yeon Ju have a brother?

70
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.410
I didn't give birth to him.

71
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.710
But they are blood-related.

72
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.090
Why are you suddenly telling me about this?

73
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.560
I'm trying to separate you from Yeon Ju.

74
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.290
I have no choice...

75
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.260
if you still want to move out...

76
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.330
after hearing my story.

77
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.470
But this is my last hidden card.

78
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.910
You can tell me.

79
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.280
What happened?

80
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.530
Han Gyul, you're really good at drawing.

81
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.980
Who are they?

82
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.460
Dad, me, and Yeon Ju.

83
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.330
No, I mean Mom.

84
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.700
Han Gyul.

85
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.100
Do you remember your real mom?

86
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.340
You don't?

87
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.980
Don't you remember her face?

88
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.650
Mom went to a far away place.

89
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.290
I lived with Aunt Su Ji,

90
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.460
but she also left.

91
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.830
Is that why you were alone for a long time?

92
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.330
I was scared.

93
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.470
I was also hungry.

94
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.790
Grandma, will Dad also go somewhere far away?

95
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.150
Will he leave me by myself?

96
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.840
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.460
He won't go anywhere.

98
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.600
You also have a step mom now.

99
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.830
You're going to have a good time from now on.

100
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.400
You also have Grandpa, Grandma, and Aunt Ru Ri.

101
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.840
Don't worry.

102
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.710
Really?

103
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.730
Do you mean I will also have...

104
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.480
a mom and dad like the other kids?

105
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.890
Of course. All you have to do is be happy from now on.

106
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.290
It happened...

107
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.090
over 40 years ago.

108
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.560
I have never told this to a single soul.

109
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.330
This is...

110
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.140
my dark past.

111
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.140
I'm sure you know where I'm from.

112
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.480
You always mention your hometown.

113
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.780
You said you picked cockles in Beolgyo.

114
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.950
I was the eldest daughter of a poor family.

115
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.290
My parents fell into the water from a boat and drowned.

116
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.890
So at the age of 15,

117
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.460
I became the head of my family with three siblings.

118
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.130
I couldn't feed them by just picking cockles.

119
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.270
So I had no other option than to go to a rich family...

120
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.140
and work as a nanny.

121
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.480
I thought he was a widower,

122
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.720
but there was a three-year-old boy.

123
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.190
That boy got attached to me like I was his sister.

124
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.280
I was so busy trying to take care of him...

125
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.390
that I didn't think the work was hard.

126
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.400
My gosh.

127
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.230
- Hey. - Catch me!

128
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.450
Come back here.

129
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.220
I continued to work there, and when I turned 18,

130
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.890
I became the widower's second wife because he promised...

131
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.290
he would support my siblings' studies.

132
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.600
So Ha Eun Jo...

133
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.100
was the boy?

134
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.710
Yes, he was the boy.

135
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.640
The boy I raised.

136
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.280
Then...

137
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.610
where is he now?

138
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.620
That...

139
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.090
I don't know.

140
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.420
Excuse me?

141
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.560
How come?

142
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.430
I,

143
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.860
Yang Chun Ok,

144
00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.970
abandoned him.

145
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.700
Father, I made the right decision, right?

146
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.850
My choosing So Won over my mom broke her heart.

147
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.920
I know. I'm grateful for it.

148
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.920
However, do you know what the best way to make your mom happy is?

149
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.430
It's not getting a divorce and living a happy life.

150
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.750
So in a way, you're making...

151
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.330
your mom very happy.

152
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.300
That's why I'm going to live happily with So Won to show her that.

153
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.020
And to be honest, I'm really sorry about what I did to my mom,

154
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.560
but I'm also excited.

155
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.480
So Won and I have never lived by ourselves.

156
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.750
What do you mean by yourselves? You're forgetting Han Gyul.

157
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.320
Oh, right.

158
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.370
I forgot So Won had a daughter.

159
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.260
So Won's daughter? Do you hear yourself?

160
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.510
From now on, she's your child. She's your daughter.

161
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.750
Right, right. That's what I meant.

162
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.200
Don't you forget about her.

163
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.550
You're not just a lady now. You're a mother.

164
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.810
Do you know how heavy the responsibility of a mother is?

165
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.430
Since you made your decision,

166
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.330
you must do your best to be a good parent just like me.

167
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.980
Please stop.

168
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.030
Do you think raising someone else's child is easy?

169
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.720
I need time to get used to the idea.

170
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.540
Once she's on our family registry, she'll be my daughter.

171
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.820
I'll take care of this.

172
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.690
I was just saying it out of concern.

173
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.460
Anyway, brace yourself,

174
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.950
and the moment you step outside of the house, you must be reborn.

175
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.600
I got it, Father.

176
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.060
But what kind of a house is it?

177
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.510
Oh, the house?

178
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.880
It was hard to find this one.

179
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.630
Everyone lined up to rent this house,

180
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.800
but I know the realtor with whom I went to school.

181
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.870
So I got the listing.

182
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.300
I see. If I were to compare it to a designer handbag,

183
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.800
this house is like a limited edition of a handbag, right?

184
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.060
Nice. I can't wait to see it. Aren't you excited?

185
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.960
Whatever you're imagining,

186
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.450
it'll be beyond your imagination.

187
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.730
Sweet!

188
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.500
You abandoned him?

189
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.170
Yes.

190
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.980
I abandoned him.

191
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.350
Why? You said you and the boy got along well.

192
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.070
There must be a reason to what you did...

193
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.720
despite your good relationship with him.

194
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.590
I had a mother-in-law.

195
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.190
She was one nasty witch.

196
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.040
She changed into a completely different person...

197
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.910
after she got what she wanted.

198
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.450
She was a different person when she was trying to get me to marry him.

199
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.100
She used to make my life miserable.

200
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.840
Who told you to do that? You never listen to me!

201
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.200
Why is that?

202
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.290
- You live under my roof. - I'm sorry.

203
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.420
You punk.

204
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.440
- I could put up with her. - Are you really sorry?

205
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.900
- She scolded my youngest brother... - Listen to me!

206
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.530
- who came with me to that house. - You ungrateful rascal.

207
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.980
That drove me crazy.

208
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.540
Since my brother and her grandson were the same age,

209
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.060
they fought often.

210
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.250
And when they fought,

211
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.880
- she hit his calves and back. - Good boy. Look at you eating.

212
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.100
He had bruises all over his body.

213
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.670
There wasn't a single spot where it wasn't bruised.

214
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.690
How dare you hide?

215
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.680
The promise that he'd support my siblings' studies was a lie.

216
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.040
She starved and abused them.

217
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.380
My goodness.

218
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.630
- Let go of me. - Later, she sent my siblings...

219
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.350
- to another family as servants... - Let me go!

220
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.050
only because they argued with Eun Jo.

221
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.590
So...

222
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.330
is that why you abandoned him?

223
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.750
- Hurry. - No, I don't want to.

224
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.920
I told you to hurry.

225
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.890
- Hurry. Come on. Walk. - My legs hurt.

226
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.120
- My mother-in-law went... - Come!

227
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.700
- to a party for a few days. - Hurry.

228
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.160
I was getting ready to go out to see my siblings.

229
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.810
- Let's go! - He wanted to come with me.

230
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.950
So I took him with me, and we were at the train station,

231
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.250
he fell asleep.

232
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.860
Their love has conceived a child

233
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:20.700
Why did they have to face this hardship?

234
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.970
I tried to wake up him, but he wouldn't wake up.

235
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.930
I tried to put him on my back.

236
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.240
So I just...

237
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.320
I mean I didn't have time.

238
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.110
So I just left him at the station.

239
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.710
That's what happened when I went...

240
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.880
to see my siblings.

241
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.220
What happened?

242
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.960
Hey, kid. Kid.

243
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.200
Wake up.

244
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.670
Kid.

245
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.480
Mom! Mom!

246
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.180
Mom!

247
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.050
Mom!

248
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.350
What am I going to do?

249
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.010
Why did you leave me?

250
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.710
- When he woke up, - No!

251
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.560
I wasn't there, so he threw a fit.

252
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.300
I don't know if he got on another train or not.

253
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.330
After that day,

254
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.670
I lost him forever.

255
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.240
Even until now,

256
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.210
I think about this a dozen times a day.

257
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:50.220
If he were my son, would I have left him at the train station?

258
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.460
Perhaps, I left him because he wasn't my own flesh and blood.

259
00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.960
Do you understand now...

260
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.000
why I can't let Yeon Ju raise someone else's child?

261
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.070
How could Yeon Ju do...

262
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.240
something even I couldn't do?

263
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.690
I know my daughter very well.

264
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.580
Yeon Ju is not capable of bringing up someone else's child.

265
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.080
I'm serious.

266
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.080
After I lost him,

267
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.220
I lived my whole life in the purgatory.

268
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.440
Do you want me to pass down this life...

269
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.360
of misfortune to Yeon Ju?

270
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.090
So Won.

271
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.840
I'm begging you.

272
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.070
Please don't make Yeon Ju a sinner like me.

273
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.840
Please...

274
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.740
let her go now.

275
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.350
I'm begging you.

276
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.180
Please. I'm begging you.

277
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.430
My gosh.

278
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.200
Why isn't it coming out?

279
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.390
My gosh. Hey! At least give back my money.

280
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.440
Hey, give back my money! My money!

281
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.610
My goodness.

282
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.680
Hey.

283
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.180
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?

284
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.120
He gave me a scare.

285
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.830
I can't believe this.

286
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.590
Why are you doing this to me?

287
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.830
I already told you. You're pretty.

288
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.170
I know that I'm not pretty.

289
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.520
When men say a woman is pretty to someone...

290
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.470
who only has good personality, they're being sarcastic.

291
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.240
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

292
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.980
No, I would never do that.

293
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.550
Look, how am I pretty?

294
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.770
My eyes, nose,

295
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.220
and lips aren't pretty.

296
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.820
Why can't you answer me?

297
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.960
You look like the person I love the most.

298
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.960
That's nonsense.

299
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.300
Do I look like Korea's sweetheart, Suzy?

300
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.430
Who is it?

301
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.600
Who do I look like?

302
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.290
This person.

303
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.830
Who is this person?

304
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.120
This is my Grandma. She raised me.

305
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.760
She looks exactly like me.

306
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.790
You're really pretty.

307
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.560
My features are quite rare.

308
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.540
Hurry up and get married...

309
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.710
to make a family for me.

310
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.210
To do that, I need to get rid of Ru Ri first.

311
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.880
Take a look and see if it came out correctly.

312
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.630
This is enough. You did a good job.

313
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.940
You know, right?

314
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.200
I'll get fired if my boss finds out.

315
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.380
The fact that I changed the poster must be kept as a secret.

316
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.140
Don't worry about me. You should be careful.

317
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.480
I won't tell anyone.

318
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.130
(Country of Origin: Pork from Chile, Vegetables, rice, cabbage,)

319
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.390
(chili Flakes from China)

320
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.120
(How to make the new sauce)

321
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.910
I will tell you how to make the sauce of our new menu.

322
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.480
The basis is 1kg of water, 100g of soy sauce,

323
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.950
1 pear, 1 apple, 1 ginger, 10 cloves of garlic,

324
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.920
- anchovies, and salt. - It's like she's rapping.

325
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.120
- And... - What is she saying?

326
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.640
Did you memorize everything?

327
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.260
Of course.

328
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.210
I can't make a mistake when it's our first day teaching the new menu.

329
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.150
It's my first class. I'm so nervous.

330
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.390
Being nervous while teaching means that you're not prepared enough.

331
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.020
You're perfectly prepared, so don't be nervous.

332
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.220
Manager Jung, can't you just do everything alone?

333
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.130
I can't rap.

334
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.500
Let's go. We need to leave right now to not be late.

335
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.900
Okay.

336
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.700
Manager Jung, we're in trouble. Look at this.

337
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.110
This is the poster of the new menu. Is there something wrong?

338
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.810
We put this up on every restaurant, and people are making complaints.

339
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.880
The marks-of-origin is wrong.

340
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.290
The pork is from Korea. Why does it say that it's from Chile?

341
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.390
The vegetables are marked that they're from China.

342
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.960
Most of them are from Korea.

343
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.990
Ru Ri, weren't you responsible for giving this to the print shop?

344
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.460
Yes.

345
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.000
I clearly remember giving them a correctly marked poster.

346
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.500
How did this happen?

347
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.500
Did the print shop make a mistake?

348
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.870
That can't be.

349
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.970
I checked with my own eyes there.

350
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.810
It's not the time for this.

351
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.550
It's already spread everywhere. We need to take care of this.

352
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.520
The class is about to start. What should we do?

353
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.440
Ru RI, you were responsible for the posters.

354
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.170
Go to the restaurants and apologize.

355
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.120
Collect the posters and reprint them.

356
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.440
Okay, Manager Jung. I'm sorry.

357
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.660
We'll go with you. We'll take care of the northern part of Seoul.

358
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.760
What are you doing? Follow me.

359
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.200
Okay.

360
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.970
Manager Jung, let's go. I'll help with the class.

361
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.070
Hurry.

362
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.670
What are you doing?

363
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.200
- It's already out everywhere. - I'm sorry.

364
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.520
I'll take them with me and reprint them.

365
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.230
This is how you make the sauce.

366
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.570
I'm okay.

367
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.220
You went through a lot of trouble today.

368
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.390
You must be tired from standing. Get some rest.

369
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.920
I'll clean up.

370
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.220
It's okay.

371
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.860
Don't you have to go?

372
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.960
You need to take care of the posters.

373
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.470
Oh, right. I forgot about that because of the class.

374
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.700
Then please clean up for me.

375
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.480
Excuse me for a moment.

376
00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.450
Ru Ri.

377
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.170
What happened to the posters?

378
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.750
I finished collecting the posters, and I'm at the print shop now.

379
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.870
Stay there, and wait for me.

380
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.870
The class is over, so I'll go there.

381
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.140
It's okay.

382
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.710
You must be tired. I can do this by myself.

383
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.040
No.

384
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.210
I'm really tired today. I need to see you to recharge.

385
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.320
It's only going to take me around 40 minutes.

386
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.360
Wait a minute. I'll call later.

387
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.860
Manager Jung?

388
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.140
Are you okay?

389
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.970
Yes, I'm okay.

390
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.610
I scolded Ru Ri because she didn't mop the floor properly.

391
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.010
I guess this is my karma.

392
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.250
Don't worry.

393
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.290
Don't move. It looks like you seriously hurt your ankle.

394
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.690
What should I do?

395
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.460
Don't you have to get going?

396
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.630
Let's go to the hospital first.

397
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.380
(Orthopedist Specialist, Lee So Won)

398
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.360
I'm begging you.

399
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.360
Please don't make Yeon Ju a sinner like me.

400
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.970
Please let her go now.

401
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.320
Honey, hurry up and come home.

402
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.690
I'm looking around for our house with Father.

403
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.980
I love you.

404
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.890
We're here.

405
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.110
Is this the place?

406
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.260
Yes.

407
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.170
This is the sweet home...

408
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.170
for the three of you to live after moving out from your old house.

409
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.000
Sweet home?

410
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.440
Why are you so surprised?

411
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.380
Father, this really can't be...

412
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.110
the house where I will live, right?

413
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.430
Don't worry.

414
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.930
Even if it looks like this on the outside, it's quite nice inside.

415
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.070
Let's go in.

416
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.690
The realtor is already there waiting for us.

417
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.150
Wait a minute.

418
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.960
Father, is this the best you can do?

419
00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.680
This is my first time living outside Gangnam.

420
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.790
Let's just go in.

421
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.010
People and houses all depend on how you decorate them.

422
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.230
Okay? Let's go in.

423
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.170
I'm in trouble.

424
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.160
Look. Even if the condition is like this,

425
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.930
it will look like new if you hang new wallpaper.

426
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.110
I see.

427
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.810
I know because I used to work for a construction company.

428
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.550
The structure is quite nice.

429
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.280
How big is this place?

430
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.670
It's 80m²,

431
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.950
but doesn't it look like 95m² because of the structure?

432
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.620
Are there three rooms?

433
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.890
Of course. Consider yourself lucky.

434
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.260
It's hard to find a place like this at this price.

435
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.970
You should use the biggest room.

436
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.650
Han Gyul should use the small room.

437
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.070
Use the other room as a dressing room.

438
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:45.940
What's wrong?

439
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.980
There's a cockroach over there.

440
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.010
Why are you making such a fuss? Every house has cockroaches.

441
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.620
It's nothing.

442
00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.160
Hey, Yeon Ju.

443
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.010
Yeon Ju.

444
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.210
Wait a minute.

445
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.730
Let's talk for a moment.

446
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.730
Father, don't you think that you're being unfair with me?

447
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.750
- What are you talking about? - You already know.

448
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.700
It's so hard for me right now.

449
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.660
I gave up everything I have for So Won.

450
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.380
Even my mom, who is the most precious person in the world to me.

451
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.830
Also,

452
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.100
the moment I move out, I become the mother...

453
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.480
of a six-year-old child, whom I didn't even give birth to.

454
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.600
Yes, I know.

455
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.190
That's why I'm thankful.

456
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.740
But weren't you expecting this when you decided to move out?

457
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.260
Even so, you should try your best to help me out.

458
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.980
To be honest, I don't think I'll be able to...

459
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.980
live in a house that is smaller than my dressing room.

460
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.650
When So Won goes to work, I have to stay here...

461
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.710
in this small house with his daughter all-day-long.

462
00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.780
His daughter?

463
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.660
Gosh, every time you mention her, you say she's his daughter.

464
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.230
Are you sure you can become a mother to her?

465
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.270
Father.

466
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:06.390
And I think you have a huge misunderstanding.

467
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.210
As soon as you leave your mother's side,

468
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.010
you're not the daughter of a rich family anymore.

469
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.810
You're just a wife of a salaryman.

470
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.450
Please don't forget that this is the reality.

471
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.970
You should live to fit your level.

472
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.490
With doctor's credit, we can take out a loan of 300,000 dollars.

473
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.990
That's enough to buy a decent house, and start a decent life.

474
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.780
Why would I choose a hard way?

475
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.930
Are you making fun of me because I'm poor now?

476
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.050
Gosh.

477
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.270
Hey, do you think I've got so much time...

478
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.940
that I'd make fun of my daughter-in-law?

479
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.640
You do have much free time. You are retired and unemployed.

480
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.970
Hey! Daughter-in-law!

481
00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.520
What, Father?

482
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.230
You...

483
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.860
Answer me honestly.

484
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.030
Do you know how much bus fees cost?

485
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.390
Why would I take the bus?

486
00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.590
I have my car.

487
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.960
All right. Then do you know how to cook rice?

488
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.420
How about laundry or recycling?

489
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.390
Why would I do that?

490
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.430
We have a maid.

491
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.980
Are you going to bring her when you move out?

492
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.880
I can get a new one.

493
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.170
I'll do the housekeeping.

494
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:13.570
You make sure to get me a big house.

495
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.010
All right. Will you be satisfied with a house twice as big as this?

496
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.180
Of course.

497
00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.510
Can you afford a house like that?

498
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.730
Of course.

499
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.400
You're going to live in my house.

500
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.770
What?

501
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.060
Are you asking me to live with my in-laws?

502
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.920
I've been thinking,

503
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.930
and I don't think you'll survive after you move out.

504
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.700
You're full of pride and vanity.

505
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.900
You'll be complaining every day just as you did today,

506
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.440
saying you can't live like this.

507
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.290
This is for your own good.

508
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.720
You should learn housekeeping from your mother-in-law.

509
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.180
Gosh. Oh, gosh. Oh, my. I can't believe this.

510
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.730
Just believe it.

511
00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.950
This is my final word.

512
00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.070
Pack your bags, and move in to and move into my house tomorrow.

513
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.970
And...

514
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.440
I'm ordering you...

515
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.710
never to talk back to me from now on.

516
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.180
It makes me feel bad.

517
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.610
Do you understand?

518
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.120
Father!

519
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.520
Father!

520
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.440
This doesn't make sense.

521
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.540
Why don't you have any money?

522
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.230
What a poor way of living!

523
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.850
This must be a nightmare.

524
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.580
Gosh, this doesn't make sense. How can this happen?

525
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.250
This can't be happening. I can't live this low life.

526
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.590
I know my daughter very well.

527
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:44.310
Yeon Ju is not capable of bringing up someone else's child.

528
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.110
I can't live this low life.

529
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.830
I can't believe this.

530
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.600
How can I live here?

531
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.160
Gosh, this can't be true!

532
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.690
How would I live here? Oh, my gosh.

533
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.760
This is nice.

534
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.710
Do you like it that much?

535
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.180
I think I'm addicted.

536
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.020
After listening to classes all day,

537
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.600
my body aches so much. I need to loosen up.

538
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.090
Excuse me, sir.

539
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.730
I'm sorry, but other customers wish to try this.

540
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.330
You should give others a chance too.

541
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.410
Wait.

542
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.900
Do you think that your eyebrows suit you?

543
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.690
Yes, of course. I copied Song Hye Kyo's eyebrows.

544
00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.620
Wait a moment.

545
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.410
- Sit here. - What are you doing?

546
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.460
- Sit over here. - I'm busy.

547
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.280
Just trust him.

548
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.700
Trust who?

549
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.170
Look.

550
00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.170
A person with a round face should draw an arch on your eyebrows.

551
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.920
Oh, my. It's so pretty. Gosh.

552
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.940
Wearing makeup is not about copying other people.

553
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.630
It's about finding yourself, okay?

554
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.680
Yes, I get it. Thank you so much.

555
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.700
You can enjoy more. Please visit often.

556
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.460
Take care of your hands. These are golden hands.

557
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.160
Soon, you'll be earning a lot.

558
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.330
Gosh, you're still young. Why do you care so much about money?

559
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.500
Don't you know?

560
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.560
Mom and Dad are fighting again.

561
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.620
What if they break up?

562
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.940
So what do you suggest we do?

563
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.740
Let's earn money and give them a surprise wedding,

564
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.320
so that they won't ever break up.

565
00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.980
For my whole life, I lived alone without a family.

566
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.700
If I have a child of my own, please help me meet my child.

567
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.140
I won't do anything bad to him.

568
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.970
How on earth...

569
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.040
did he find that place?

570
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:02.180
Articles about the workshop were on newspapers and magazines.

571
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.080
That's probably how he knew.

572
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.410
But if he heard the conversation, he'd have found out...

573
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.390
that you have his son.

574
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.930
What will you do?

575
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.290
What do you think I should do?

576
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.400
I'm just going to pretend not to know.

577
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.200
Let's just tell Tae Yang everything.

578
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.850
You can't hide from him the fact...

579
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.400
that his father is alive forever.

580
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.020
You should tell the truth to him and leave him to...

581
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.190
Are you out of your mind?

582
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.610
You don't know what he's like.

583
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.160
He looks normal now, but when he gets drunk,

584
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.880
he becomes a completely different person.

585
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.890
And I don't want Tae Yang to know about my past.

586
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.360
You had a reason then.

587
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.660
He'll understand.

588
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.900
I want to be a mom...

589
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.630
who can be loved, not just understood.

590
00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.620
And I've erased all my past.

591
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.000
You should forget about it too.

592
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.530
Have you seen all the documents that I sent to you?

593
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.680
Yes, of course.

594
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.000
Where is Anna Kang?

595
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.890
She's living in Seoul with the name of Jung Hwa Young.

596
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.740
She caused the incident, fled to Korea secretly,

597
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.630
and lived as an unregistered person.

598
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.000
Then she got married to get a new identity.

599
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.850
This means she committed a serious crime...

600
00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.300
in both the US and Korea.

601
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.470
Of course.

602
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.460
She committed a murder attempt in the US...

603
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.560
and crime of the false entries in an authentic deed...

604
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.380
and forgery in Korea.

605
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.000
If she's found guilty, she could be deported from Korea.

606
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.320
The problem is...

607
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.650
that she attempted murder 30 years ago.

608
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.060
Can she still be punished?

609
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.990
Korea has signed a criminal extradition agreement with the US.

610
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.580
If we can bring her to a trial,

611
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.670
we can get her sentenced to life imprisonment for her crime.

612
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.270
Really?

613
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.570
That means her life depends on me.

614
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.120
I feel pity for him.

615
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.710
He doesn't even know...

616
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.360
his son's alive.

617
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.230
Did you check Sarah Kang's schedule?

618
00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.330
Yes, sir.

619
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.800
She's got a tight schedule, so we only have today.

620
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:41.010
I must make her talk today.

621
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.880
Jung Hwa Young denies this,

622
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.710
but I'm sure she has my son.

623
00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:49.580
Sir. She's over there.

624
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.870
I really enjoyed today's lesson.

625
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.870
Thank you.

626
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.320
Really? You've done so well so far.

627
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.250
You should go.

628
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.330
All right. Bye.

629
00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.660
I need to talk to you.

630
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.940
I told you there's nothing I can say to you.

631
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.600
Please, leave my sister alone.

632
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.480
Then should I go to Anna's house myself?

633
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.420
I know where she lives.

634
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.770
I'm curious how she'd react...

635
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.460
when I show this to Jung Hwa Young.

636
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.730
It went easier than we thought.

637
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.880
Go Jung Do will leave her...

638
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.170
when he finds out.

639
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.450
That'd be nice, but if he doesn't,

640
00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.670
I'll make him leave her.

641
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.580
Where are you taking me?

642
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.990
I told you. You'll find out.

643
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:05.260
I don't know what your plan is, but it won't work.

644
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.300
I won't give you the answer you are looking for.

645
00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.400
Let's talk later.

646
00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:22.540
Hello, Chairman Kevin.

647
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.930
Hello. Keep up the good work.

648
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:25.280
(SC Food and Beverage)

649
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.150
SC Food and Beverage?

650
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.660
Hello.

651
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.060
- Are you going out? - Yes.

652
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.570
I'll see you later.

653
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.150
Give me the document on Anna Kang.

654
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.650
Here it is.

655
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.860
That must be Jung Hwa Young's sister.

656
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.130
Why is she with Chairman Kevin?

657
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.400
I don't know.

658
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.340
I think they're heading to the chairman office.

659
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.710
- You can leave early today. - Yes, sir.

660
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.130
Did you call me to show off how successful you are?

661
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.300
I wanted to show you...

662
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.030
that I have changed.

663
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.330
Really?

664
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:56.900
But unfortunately,

665
00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.070
money doesn't change the human nature.

666
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.110
Do you know why I tried to become successful?

667
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.920
I wanted to be seen decent when I see her again.

668
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.020
I also wanted to be nice to my son...

669
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.860
who may be somewhere in this world.

670
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.230
Too bad.

671
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.310
You don't have a son to be nice to.

672
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.760
Stop it, please.

673
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.260
How many times do I have to tell you?

674
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.530
I've changed. I'm not old the Jay anymore.

675
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.740
Look at me.

676
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.570
Do I still look like a drunkard to you?

677
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.140
After I broke up with her, I even changed my name.

678
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.880
You have no idea when I went through...

679
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.010
to succeed in LA.

680
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.580
That was my only goal.

681
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.250
The only thought I had was to meet Anna again.

682
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.350
I wanted to meet the woman who might be raising my child.

683
00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.090
I'm begging you.

684
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.290
Please accept that I've changed.

685
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.570
You're still being so unreasonable.

686
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.780
You haven't changed at all.

687
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.890
You're my sister-in-law. You said it with your own mouth...

688
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.770
that my son's somewhere in this world.

689
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.280
Is it true? It is, isn't it?

690
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.410
What's he talking about? A son?

691
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.980
He called Sarah his sister-in-law.

692
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.990
What? No way.

693
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.860
My sister made it clear.

694
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.490
She never had nor gave birth to your child.

695
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.110
She denied it.

696
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.400
Your son doesn't exist in this world.

697
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.930
What?

698
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.840
Then is Kevin that Jay?

699
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.540
He's Jung Hwa Young's ex-husband?

700
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:47.110
That means Jung Tae Yang is...

701
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:49.720
Kevin's son.

702
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.190
No way.

703
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.290
No. No way. I can't believe it.

704
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.930
I want to find my son...

705
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.940
for only one reason.

706
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.740
I want to ask for forgiveness from Anna and my child.

707
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.110
I won't disappoint or harm you.

708
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.280
Please help me.

709
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.410
It's too late for that now.

710
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:24.320
Think about what you did to my sister in Seattle.

711
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.990
You not only reported her for attempted murder,

712
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.360
but also made her go through judgment by default.

713
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.530
If you feel guilty for my sister even by little,

714
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:37.300
let her be happy with her current husband.

715
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.470
That's the only way your sin can be forgiven.

716
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.360
With doctor's credit, we can take out a loan of 300,000 dollars.

717
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.720
That's enough to buy a decent house, and start a decent life.

718
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.320
Why would I choose a hard way?

719
00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.870
That old witch.

720
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.870
She only knows about money, and she never educated her daughter.

721
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.530
How dare she keep talking back to her father-in-law?

722
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.800
Honey! Honey!

723
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.300
Honey!

724
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.550
What is it? Is someone's house on fire or something?

725
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:50.690
Someone's house?

726
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.270
Why would I care?

727
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.640
Stop being ridiculous, and empty your room tomorrow.

728
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.110
We have to hang new wallpaper.

729
00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.810
What's this about?

730
00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.500
What else?

731
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.050
I told So Won's family to move in.

732
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.680
My goodness.

733
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.700
I already feel so bad to make Yeon Ju take care of a child.

734
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.670
Are you going to make her suffer from living with her in-laws?

735
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.360
I didn't say anything about making her suffer.

736
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.790
It's because she doesn't know how to do chores.

737
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.830
I've been thinking that So Won and Han Gyul...

738
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.230
will starve if we leave it up to her.

739
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:25.100
I can't stand So Won suffering.

740
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.960
You can cook, do the laundry,

741
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.480
and watch the child for Yeon Ju.

742
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.780
So what you're saying is you're going to give them my room,

743
00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.250
and make me live as a slave for an extended family at this age?

744
00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:40.950
What?

745
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:42.760
How is that living as a slave?

746
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.970
That's a beautiful sacrifice for your family.

747
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.210
Duty as a housewife.

748
00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:48.730
The maternal love that only women have.

749
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.630
What?

750
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.230
Don't you remember?

751
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.430
You said I'm not even a woman because I'm old.

752
00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.340
So don't expect anything like that from me.

753
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.390
Also, don't get involved in their relationship.

754
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.780
They just got back together. They don't like it when you get involved.

755
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.860
Please leave them alone.

756
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.270
Just stay quiet in the corner.

757
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.320
That's the only way to help So Won.

758
00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.390
What? What did you say?

759
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.790
In the corner?

760
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.860
My gosh.

761
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.080
They say women get male hormones when they get old.

762
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.600
How did she become so negative?

763
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.000
Negative?

764
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.830
I'm copying Mrs. Yang's tacky English.

765
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.610
I can't accept it. Negative?

766
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.910
I take that back.

767
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.860
This is not right. No.

768
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.360
He's helpless.

769
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.300
I'm going to do whatever it takes to end it.

770
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:00.970
I must end it.

771
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.650
You look so different today.

772
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.690
You hated it every time I asked you to drink champagne with me.

773
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.620
I want to do...

774
00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.760
everything you want today.

775
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.160
Why?

776
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.300
Do you pity me because I'm moving out of the big house?

777
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:38.000
Will you get credit loan to buy a big house like I said?

778
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.510
I'm going to take a selfie as evidence. Here.

779
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:44.340
Promise me.

780
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:51.650
I was pretty upset because of Father today,

781
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.750
but I'm really happy now.

782
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:58.020
I wish I can just freeze this moment.

783
00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.630
Right, honey?

784
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.360
What's wrong with you? You're not smiling at all.

785
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.930
Do you have something to say?

786
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.340
What is it? Tell me.

787
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:18.780
Give me your hand.

788
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.110
My hand?

789
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:33.630
What is this?

790
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:37.080
It's your wedding ring.

791
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.260
Why would you...

792
00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.940
Honey.

793
00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.970
Let's...

794
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.540
get a divorce.

795
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:58.220
I tried to work it out, but I can't.

796
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.190
I think this is the end of our relationship like you said.

797
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.130
Why? What's wrong?

798
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.180
I said I'll do better.

799
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.460
I even left my mom. But why?

800
00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.070
Is it because I said I don't want that tiny house?

801
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.840
Would we stay together if I move into that house?

802
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.510
Then let's do that.

803
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.960
I can go everywhere with you, so...

804
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.210
Don't be so clingy.

805
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.780
That's not the reason.

806
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.420
Then what is it?

807
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:35.350
Tell me.

808
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.690
I need to know why you're breaking up with me.

809
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.630
Why are you trying to divorce me?

810
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.160
There are many reasons,

811
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.230
but there is only one reason why couples get divorced.

812
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.610
I don't love you enough...

813
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.040
to live with you.

814
00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:02.650
You are not capable of living with me forever,

815
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.080
both as a wife and a mother.

816
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.700
Rather than living with you despite the fact...

817
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.760
that I know this already and grow to hate you,

818
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.290
I think it's better to leave you when I can...

819
00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.530
at least say this to you kindly.

820
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.570
Maybe one day, you'll thank me for what I did today.

821
00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.670
I'm sorry for everything.

822
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.370
I'm sorry I chose you for what you have instead of love,

823
00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.650
for not having loved you when we were together,

824
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.320
and for causing problems with my child.

825
00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.360
That's enough. Get lost.

826
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:50.560
What you're saying is worse.

827
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.010
Stop it.

828
00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:03.010
I'll take you home.

829
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:07.110
I told you to get lost.

830
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.420
Get lost now!

831
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.250
All right.

832
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.490
See you next week in court.

833
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:22.560
Lee So Won, you scum!

834
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.430
I'll hate you forever.

835
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.670
I'll hate you, resent you,

836
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.960
and pray that you'll be ruined...

837
00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.940
as much as I've loved you.

838
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.440
I'll pray that you'll die lonely...

839
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:42.280
with only your child by your side.

840
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.750
Scumbag.

841
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.180
It's me.

842
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.490
It's over.

843
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.090
Really?

844
00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.910
Well done.

845
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:27.030
Yeon Ju...

846
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.800
will suffer for a while.

847
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.400
Please take care of her.

848
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.440
All right. Thank you.

849
00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.320
Where's is she now?

850
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.010
I'll send you the address.

851
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.840
Goodbye.

852
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.810
Take care.

853
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:12.270
Gosh, he did love Yeon Ju after all.

854
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.110
He didn't take Yeon Ju...

855
00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.910
to that fiery fit.

856
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:22.980
He did love her after all.

857
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.920
Yes, Lawyer Park, it's me.

858
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:33.390
Yes, it's finished as I expected. All is well.

859
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.230
You need to clean it up now. All right.

860
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.770
Please check if everything is all right.

861

(Christmas Special Love Set)

862
00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:57.650
(Mark-of-origin)

863
00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.750
All right. This is fine.

864
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:02.720
Isn't it a little strange?

865
00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:06.190
I checked everything. Why did I get the wrong one?

866
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.740
I... I don't know.

867
00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.560
I did what you told me to do.

868
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.160
Don't blame me.

869
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:16.290
I wasn't blaming you. I just find it a little strange.

870
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.790
You must have checked it wrong.

871
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:22.270
Are you trying to make someone else take the blame?

872
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:26.460
Are you saying that I was bribed...

873
00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.100
to switch the poster or something?

874
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.830
- Sir. - I don't need to hear it. Leave.

875
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.490
Gosh.

876
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.360
I even stayed late for you. Why would you say that?

877
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:44.360
I was just asking. Why would he get so angry?

878
00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.190
I'll be there soon. Wait for me.

879
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.270
He said he'll be here soon. This is strange.

880
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.280
Maybe something happened to him.

881
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:37.280
It's been over an hour and a half. Where are you?

882
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.320
I'm just worried. Please call me.

883
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:55.670
Have a seat.

884
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.940
I'm sorry.

885
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.040
I didn't mean to hurt my tendons and cause trouble for you.

886
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.550
Don't you have any family members to take care of you?

887
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.180
No.

888
00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:13.850
After my mother died, I've been living alone.

889
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.250
I'm sorry.

890
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.320
It'll be difficult for you to move for a while.

891
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.800
Can you cook a meal for me?

892
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.460
I'm hungry.

893
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.900
I'll do that since Chairman Kevin asked me to take care of you.

894
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.010
Do you have any ingredients?

895
00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.280
Fortunately, I'll be able to make curry for you.

896
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.460
What are you doing?

897
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:01.530
It's nothing.

898
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.940
Give it to me.

899
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.740
It's nothing.

900
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.480
What is this?

901
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.020
Why did you take so many pictures of me?

902
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.790
Joo Ae Ri, what is this?

903
00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:39.370
Can you please leave?

904
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.210
All right. I like you.

905
00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:48.500
I've been in a lot of relationships,

906
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.370
but I've never had feelings like this before. It makes me angry.

907
00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:53.420
- Joo Ae Ri... - I know.

908
00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.920
I know what you think of me.

909
00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.210
You think of me as a mean girl...

910
00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:59.740
who overuses her father's power.

911
00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.030
But I don't care.

912
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.610
However you think of me,

913
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:05.230
this is what I feel about you.

914
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.830
I will love you by myself, and I will finish this by myself.

915
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.100
Don't mind me.

916
00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:13.020
Listen to me.

917
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.040
I told you already. I don't want anything from you.

918
00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.650
Just pretend like you don't know about my feelings.

919
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.510
I forgot about Ru Ri.

920
00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.590
It must be Manager Jung.

921
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:07.030
Hello?

922
00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.760
Where are you, Ru Ri?

923
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:15.130
I'm working overnight at the company.

924
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:16.520
We're going to sell a new menu tomorrow.

925
00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.500
I need to finish the posters by today.

926
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.660
That's not what you should be doing right now.

927
00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.440
You're in a big trouble.

928
00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.210
What? What is it?

929
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.430
I don't want to explain everything.

930
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:28.650
Just take a look at Joo Ae Ri's SNS.

931
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:30.550
Gosh, I'm busy.

932
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:31.650
Okay.

933
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.360
I'm excited...

934
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.530
to have someone who would cook for me.

935
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.510
Is he cheating on you with Joo Ae Ri?

936
00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.040
I can't believe it.

937
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:01.810
Ru Ri.

938
00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.420
This is a relief.

939
00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:07.850
I was worried you left already.

940
00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.690
I'm sorry. I couldn't keep the promise.

941
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.400
Ru Ri.

942
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.940
Are you upset?

943
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.010
I had to take care of something. That's why I couldn't call you.

944
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:29.940
What was it?

945
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.610
There was an accident in the restaurant, so I went to a hospital.

946
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:34.780
It wasn't a big accident.

947
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.030
I got an order to look after some employee...

948
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:38.820
Who is that employee?

949
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:42.320
Who is it?

950
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.860
Is she that important...

951
00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.960
to forget about the promise you made with me?

952
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:48.960
I'm sorry.

953
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.300
I'm really sorry that I'm late.

954
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.730
So let's stop talking about it.

955
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.900
Let's go. I'll give you a ride home.

956
00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.600
Why can't you say it?

957
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.870
Is it so hard to tell me who it is?

958
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:04.040
Lee Ru Ri.

959
00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.810
Is it because it's her?

960
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.410
(I'm excited to have someone who would cook for me.)

961
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.250
Let's stop it here before it gets ugly.

962
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.020
Let me explain.

963
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.030
Joo Ae Ri got hurt in the kitchen after the training.

964
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.400
She couldn't walk because she hurt her ankle,

965
00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.660
so I only gave her ride home.

966
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.930
- This picture... - Did you cook dinner for her...

967
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.240
because you were worried she'd starve?

968
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.770
It was so precious that you didn't give me a call.

969
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:37.460
Did you forget I was waiting for you?

970
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.880
Don't say it like that.

971
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.080
I couldn't call you because I lost track.

972
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.220
I regretted because it wouldn't have happened...

973
00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.450
if I did the clean up.

974
00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:49.920
I understand how you must be feeling,

975
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.990
but can we stop talking about it?

976
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.630
Just blame me for being late.

977
00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.510
Why do we have to fight because of Joo Ae Ri...

978
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:57.710
who has nothing to do with us?

979
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:59.330
Did you say she has nothing to do with us?

980
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.080
She likes you.

981
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.290
It says right here.

982
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:05.900
She's excited because you're cooking for her.

983
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:07.770
What upsets me is that...

984
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:10.610
when you were with Joo Ae Ri,

985
00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:12.360
I was worried...

986
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.160
that you might have gotten into an accident.

987
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.510
For two hours.

988
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.250
Whatever.

989
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.090
It's up to you to follow your heart.

990
00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.670
If you like Joo Ae Ri, do what your heart tells you.

991
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:26.840
Are you serious...

992
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.860
I don't care even if you say it's out of inferiority.

993
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.900
I can't go through...

994
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:35.730
what Myung Tae did to me...

995
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.300
ever again.

996
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.840
I'd rather end it here now.

997
00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:43.980
Have you forgotten what you said with your own mouth?

998
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.610
You said you'll trust me no matter what.

999
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:51.380
You said you won't be nervous or disturbed.

1000
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:53.750
But what did you just say?

1001
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.090
You want to end it for this?

1002
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:58.990
What are you doing?

1003
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.290
I'm sorry for everything I did today.

1004
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.560
Please don't get upset over it.

1005
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.600
I'll tell everyone to stop you from being nervous...

1006
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.100
that we're in a relationship.

1007
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.110
There's no need.

1008
01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.210
If we need other people to know to continue our relationship,

1009
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.310
it means it's already falling apart.

1010
01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.550
I'm hungry, Grandma.

1011
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.470
Okay.

1012
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.290
Is he okay?

1013
01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:26.110
So Won said he'll be home soon, but he's not.

1014
01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:29.980
Right. I'll call him.

1015
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:36.860
How dare you?

1016
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.840
You should eat first.

1017
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.060
You must be starving.

1018
01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.330
No. She needs to learn to wait.

1019
01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.830
Hey, Han Gyul.

1020
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.770
You always looked for your dad,

1021
01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.970
but can't you stay decent in front of food?

1022
01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.110
What does decent mean?

1023
01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.910
Oh, right. Decent means...

1024
01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:02.410
It's...

1025
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.700
It's something you have to keep...

1026
01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.440
- I'm home. - Hi.

1027
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.750
Dad.

1028
01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.490
Did you have fun today?

1029
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:14.080
Why are you alone?

1030
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.760
You should've brought Yeon Ju with you.

1031
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.300
Yeon Ju will not come here anymore.

1032
01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.330
What? What do you mean?

1033
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.000
Why not?

1034
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.960
My goodness. Why would you ask?

1035
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.240
Yeon Ju probably doesn't want to live with us.

1036
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:33.810
Am I right?

1037
01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:36.820
So Won. You have to remember this.

1038
01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.480
You'll get exhausted...

1039
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:41.590
if you let your wife control you.

1040
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.620
Based on my experience,

1041
01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.990
women must look narrow and be stupid,

1042
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:51.750
so that men can lead them...

1043
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.110
with a deep insight...

1044
01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:54.300
I'm...

1045
01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:56.500
getting a divorce.

1046
01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.740
What?

1047
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.610
What?

1048
01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.980
What did you just say?

1049
01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.920
Say that again.

1050
01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.090
Yeon Ju and I agreed...

1051
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.270
to get a divorce.

1052
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:19.860
- What... - What?

1053
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.130
What? Who said you could do that?

1054
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.400
Who said so?

1055
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.320
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1056
01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.690
- So Won. You jerk! - I'm over with Yeon Ju.

1057
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:38.090
I didn't want to see her break like that.

1058
01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:40.500
You must look great when you get divorced,

1059
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.160
so that he'll regret.

1060
01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.870
Look as decent as you can.

1061
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:45.370
I'm becoming a regular employee today.

1062
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:47.700
Are you sure someone's not behind this?

1063
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.200
I did that because I want Jung Tae Yang.

1064
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.440
You're not worth for a man like him.

1065
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.730
Should I give up on Manager Jung?

1066
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.580
Kevin's the chairman of that company.

1067
01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.310
He can provide bright future for Tae Yang.

1068
01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:01.420
You can't fight against Chairman Kevin.

1069
01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.500
I was worried she might abandon you.
