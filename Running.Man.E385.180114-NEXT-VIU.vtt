Gosh, no, no. Stop it. You're making me blush.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.120 line:93%
(Come on. Don't make me blush now.)

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.360 line:93%
- This is embarrassing. - Doesn't he...

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.360 line:93%
- look great? - It's hot in here.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.460 line:93%

- What's going on? - Jae Seok.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.160 line:93%
- A shearling jacket. - I wore a shearling jacket.

- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.549 line:93%
You look like pickled radish!

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.150 line:93%
Pickled radish!

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.689 line:93%
- Pickled radish! - I don't look like pickled radish.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.920 line:93%
You do. You look like you jumped out of gimbap.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.219 line:93%
You called me Jaws Bar at Entertainment Awards.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.719 line:93%
Now, you call me pickled radish.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.859 line:93%
For goodness' sake.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.689 line:93%
(She goes from Jaws Bar to pickled radish.)

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:45.030 line:93%
- Se Chan dressed up today. - No, I didn't.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.929 line:93%
- Stop it, So Min. - Look at his ankles.

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.030 line:93%
My goodness.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.499 line:93%
Se Chan, your ankles will ache when you get old.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.069 line:93%
- You will get arthritis. - It's okay.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.370 line:93%
Your ankles will ache.

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.209 line:93%
I am only 33 years old.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.079 line:93%
You deserve a beating.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.410 line:93%
I am 38 years old now. It's a disaster.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.149 line:93%
- Are you 38 years old? - Yes.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.849 line:93%

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:10.290 line:93%
(Song Ji Hyo, a woman who is pushing 40)

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.320 line:93%
Ji Hyo.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.689 line:93%
(They exchange blessings to start the year.)

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.889 line:93%
You are pushing 40.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.260 line:93%

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:19.629 line:93%

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.999 line:93%
- Hurry up, and bring the jacket. - I was startled...

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.570 line:93%
- when I looked in the mirror. - Why?

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.670 line:93%
The shoulders were too much.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.769 line:93%
(The earlier outfit was too much.)

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:31.939 line:93%
I wanted to talk about it during the opening! Why did you change?

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:36.920 line:93%
(5 minutes ago, Jae Seok entered for the 1st time)

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.950 line:93%
(Power shoulders)

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.519 line:93%
(He looked like he just played a game of rugby.)

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.489 line:93%
Don't say anything before the opening.

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:47.859 line:93%
He figured it out on his own.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:49.389 line:93%
- Really? - He had an instinct.

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.400 line:93%
So Min was forced to look like a high school student.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.769 line:93%
A flashback. A flashback.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:55.900 line:93%
A flashback.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.670 line:93%
In dramas, main characters are sometimes forced...

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.340 line:93%
to look like high school students.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.370 line:93%
- That's right. - She is trying to look young.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.409 line:93%
- A flashback. - She went too far back in the past.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.739 line:93%
- That's right. - That's the impression I got.

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.150 line:93%
It makes it impossible for you to enjoy the drama.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.650 line:93%
I thought her hair was dried herring.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.249 line:93%
(Is this hair or herring?)

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.349 line:93%
Seriously.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.090 line:93%
- Why did you wear Hyun Woo's coat? - I didn't.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.789 line:93%
(Hyun Woo is his son.)

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:16.819 line:93%
It's not his.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.460 line:93%
He wants to look cute.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.460 line:93%
- Isn't it Hyun Woo's? - It's his wife's.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.789 line:93%
- Is it your wife's? - No, it's not.

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.530 line:93%
The winner of Top Excellence Award wants to look cute.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.830 line:93%
I asked my stylist to bring clothes that will make me look young...

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.870 line:93%
- and this happened. - In any case,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.330 line:93%
Seok Jin won Top Excellence Award.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.870 line:93%
Congratulations.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.140 line:93%
(We congratulate Seok Jin on winning Top Excellence Award.)

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.810 line:93%
Running Man, Jee Seok Jin.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.469 line:93%
(Last year, "Entertainment Awards")

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.039 line:93%
(Seok Jin did it!)

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.610 line:93%
It is thanks to you...

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.849 line:93%
that I am where I am.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.349 line:93%
I will run to the best of my abilities. Thank you.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.680 line:93%

Thank you.

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.560 line:93%
- His diligence and effort paid off. - You're right.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.330 line:93%
It's all thanks to the dear members.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.189 line:93%
There is no use in saying much as this won't air until later.

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:58.129 line:93%
You want to say "These jerks" instead, right?

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.069 line:93%
(You want to say "These jerks" instead, right?)

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.300 line:93%
"These jerks".

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.900 line:93%
(What's the story behind "These jerks"?)

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.340 line:93%
Thank you.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.140 line:93%
Seok Jin and I...

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.409 line:93%
left the get-together early after "Entertainment Awards".

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.680 line:93%
(At a get-together after "Entertainment Awards",)

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.879 line:93%
(Seok Jin picked up the tab and left.)

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:13.879 line:93%
How much is the total?

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.110 line:93%
(He looked very manly.)

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.479 line:93%
- It's not very expensive. - Thank you for the food.

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.749 line:93%
Seok Jin and I left early because we had work the next day.

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:21.789 line:93%
As he exited the restaurant, he said,

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.620 line:93%
"I can't believe these jerks."

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.219 line:93%
(I can't believe these jerks.)

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.430 line:93%
(Did you really say that?)

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.659 line:93%
Really?

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:32.800 line:93%
The total...

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.599 line:93%
was quite expensive.

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:35.830 line:93%
You know,

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.640 line:93%
I had never seen people order takeout...

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.199 line:93%
at a barbecue restaurant.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.870 line:93%
(He reveals how he truly felt.)

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.340 line:93%
You told us to do that.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.810 line:93%
Did you see Jae Seok?

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.650 line:93%
- He took a lot of pork belly. - 12 servings.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.780 line:93%
(He took a lot of pork belly.)

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.749 line:93%
(He really ordered meat to go.)

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.319 line:93%

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.390 line:93%
You told me to order meat to go.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.659 line:93%
In any case,

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.199 line:93%
it's a happy occasion.

Aren't you glad I said that?

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.030 line:93%
We are a bit more than colleagues.

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.669 line:93%

- You are right. - So Min won three awards.

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.570 line:93%
I shamelessly made Seok Jin pick up the tab.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.440 line:93%
- It's okay. - On that day,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.210 line:93%
I thought Jae Seok would help me.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.909 line:93%
Jae Seok suddenly stood up and said,

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.750 line:93%
"Is Seok Jin the only one who received an award?"

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:58.479 line:93%
Then everyone said,

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.919 line:93%
- "Jeon So Min! Jeon So Min!" - That's right.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.349 line:93%
"However,"

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.919 line:93%
"who won the Top Excellence Award?"

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.590 line:93%
- "Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!" - "Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!"

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.789 line:93%
(The answer is obvious.)

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.099 line:93%
(Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!)

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:13.830 line:93%

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.669 line:93%
- Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin! - Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.599 line:93%
Seok Jin thinks we are joking.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.840 line:93%
(I can't believe these jerks.)

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.640 line:93%
That night, I talked in my sleep.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.650 line:93%
"Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!"

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.650 line:93%

(Park Na Rae was invited to the get-together.)

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.830 line:93%

- with Running Man. - She's too much.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.679 line:93%
- Seriously. - She enjoyed herself.

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:58.440 line:93%
She didn't drink at first. When I asked why she wasn't drinking,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.479 line:93%
she said, "It will be unbecoming if I get drunk here."

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.479 line:93%
At the end, when I asked if she is okay,

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.979 line:93%
she gave me the finger.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.320 line:93%
(Na Rae showed them the epitome of drunkenness.)

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.419 line:93%
She was completely drunk.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.320 line:93%
I feel like Na Rae should visit the show.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.359 line:93%
- She should. - That's right.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.659 line:93%
Today,

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.090 line:93%
we will welcome the New Year by renewing Running Man.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.830 line:93%
We will have a race to determine who will be in the TV rating notice.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.400 line:93%
- TV rating notice. - TV rating notice.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.669 line:93%
It is shown in the beginning of the show.

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.900 line:93%
(This is TV rating notice.)

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.909 line:93%
- It's shown every week. - Yes.

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.539 line:93%
The winner of today's race...

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:30.840 line:93%
will be the director of the TV rating notice...

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.080 line:93%
and freely decide what to show in five seconds.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.380 line:93%
(The winner of the race can direct the 5-second TV rating notice.)

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.679 line:93%
- Alone? - The new TV rating notice...

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:39.320 line:93%
will be aired for a month.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.489 line:93%
- A month? - Yes.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.450 line:93%
Then you can be the main member.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.390 line:93%
- For an example, - I will try my best to win.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.119 line:93%
I can stand at the front and have the others in the back...

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:48.229 line:93%
- if I am the director. - You will have free rein.

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:50.599 line:93%
If I win, I will make Jae Seok wear that jacket.

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.299 line:93%
(I'm going to make him wear that jacket.)

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:54.299 line:93%
(Power shoulders)

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:55.969 line:93%
- For goodness' sake. - We didn't get to make fun of him.

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:57.700 line:93%
- He can do that, right? - If I say,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.010 line:93%
"Kwang Soo, stand naked," does he have to follow?

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.270 line:93%
(If I say, "Kwang Soo, stand naked," does he have to follow?)

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.409 line:93%
He can take off his top.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.940 line:93%
This show is for 12 years and older.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.049 line:93%
- 12 years and older. - What's wrong with you?

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:08.780 line:93%
I can't stand naked and say,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.719 line:93%
"This show is for 12 years and older."

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:13.289 line:93%
So Min, this show is for 12 years and older.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.890 line:93%
There's a rumor that our rating is changing because of you.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.659 line:93%
Running Man almost became a pay-per-view show because of you.

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:19.859 line:93%
This show won't get aired...

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:21.229 line:93%
with that kind of TV rating notice.

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:23.229 line:93%
As a result, the winner will make a storyboard...

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.559 line:93%
of the TV rating notice you want to see...

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:28.099 line:93%
and give a presentation.

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:29.299 line:93%
(What will the winner want to do?)

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:30.969 line:93%
What should I do?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.309 line:93%
- Can we use the water bomb? - You can use anything.

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:35.669 line:93%
- Can we film it anywhere? - Yes.

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.179 line:93%
Let's go to Nevis Swing again.

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.849 line:93%
(Let's go to Nevis Swing again.)

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.450 line:93%
- I will film in Korea. - Don't do that.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.880 line:93%
As I say, "Running Man is for 12 years and older,"

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.780 line:93%
the rest of you will be on Nevis Swing. Okay.

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:49.020 line:93%
(Is that how you're going to be?)

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.320 line:93%
My mind is set.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.059 line:93%
(Peeking)

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:54.659 line:93%
- We will be at a zoo. - Look at his drawing!

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.390 line:93%
We will be at a zoo.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.260 line:93%
(Is this Jae Seok's zoo?)

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:01.429 line:93%
You are worse than Ji Ho, your son.

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:02.969 line:93%
Ji Ho is can draw better than me.

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:06.239 line:93%
- "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals". - I also have big plans.

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:07.840 line:93%
Should So Min be...

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.510 line:93%
a frog or a parrot?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.440 line:93%
Should So Min be a frog?

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.280 line:93%
Make her upper body a frog's and her lower body a parrot's.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.210 line:93%
- What? - That would be scary.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.979 line:93%
- It's like a collaboration. - That would be scary.

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:19.580 line:93%
Just you wait.

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:21.619 line:93%
My goodness.

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:23.090 line:93%
I am worried about what So Min will do.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.020 line:93%
What kind of an animal is Se Chan?

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.320 line:93%
I am a bear, right?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.690 line:93%
(A cute bear?)

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.900 line:93%
You aren't a bear.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.829 line:93%
- I am strong. - You are fish.

00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:33.100 line:93%
- You aren't a bear. - You are fish.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.429 line:93%
Catfish.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.630 line:93%
Catfish?

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.799 line:93%
- I am not catfish! - Se Chan.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.939 line:93%
We don't have any fish.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.809 line:93%
A catfish suits you.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:42.970 line:93%
- A catfish is a good one. - Hold on.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.439 line:93%
Kwang Soo is a giraffe.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.439 line:93%
(Walking over)

00:08:46.439 --> 00:08:47.709 line:93%
Hold on. Let me take a look.

00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:49.750 line:93%
- Let me see how it looks. - Draw feelers.

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:55.919 line:93%
(Which one is the real catfish?)

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:58.189 line:93%
You are a catfish.

00:08:58.189 --> 00:08:59.760 line:93%
- It's a permanent marker. - It's a permanent marker.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.030 line:93%
- It's an oil-based marker. - It's a permanent marker.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.030 line:93%
(It's an oil-based marker.)

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:05.799 line:93%
Do you want me to walk around like this all day?

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.299 line:93%
I am sorry.

00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:08.470 line:93%
You look like a catfish.

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:11.240 line:93%
- Jae Seok, do something. - I am sorry.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.370 line:93%
(Seok Jin gets up.)

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.939 line:93%
- Jae Seok, do something. - I am sorry.

00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:17.280 line:93%
I can't do anything about it.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:19.179 line:93%
(Rubbing)

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:21.079 line:93%
You can't erase it with an eraser.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.179 line:93%
It's working.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.390 line:93%
(He gets a more realistic mustache.)

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.890 line:93%
- Come on! - He became Woong's father.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.490 line:93%
It's Woong's father!

00:09:32.189 --> 00:09:33.959 line:93%
I guess there are things you can't erase with an eraser.

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:36.390 line:93%
Are you acting this way because you won an award?

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.199 line:93%
(Are you acting this way because you won an award?)

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:40.329 line:93%
For goodness' sake.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:41.569 line:93%
Okay, so he's a catfish.

00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:42.569 line:93%
(It's funny, right?)

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.669 line:93%
They will let us do this.

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:46.000 line:93%
(They carefully make a storyboard for their 5 seconds.)

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.370 line:93%
I can be a king.

00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:50.010 line:93%
Then I will do...

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.839 line:93%
I will go to the fish market.

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.110 line:93%
(My imagination will become real.)

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.280 line:93%
This is...

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.010 line:93%
like a dream. The thought of directing this scene...

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.079 line:93%
- makes me so excited. - Seok Jin.

00:09:58.079 --> 00:09:59.319 line:93%
You won't be able to do it.

00:09:59.319 --> 00:10:01.419 line:93%
(You won't be able to do it.)

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:03.689 line:93%
(The chance is slimmer than winning a lottery.)

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:04.760 line:93%
Wait, and see.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.530 line:93%
That's why I am not curious about your idea.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.730 line:93%
There is a twist. It's five seconds.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.130 line:93%
(They can't wait to see whose idea will win.)

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.959 line:93%
- Is the current one five seconds? - Yes.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.130 line:93%
- This isn't easy. - Seok Jin gets...

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.069 line:93%
the most amount of screen time in the TV rating notice.

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:17.740 line:93%
(He attacks with a fact.)

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.539 line:93%
(Say that again, you jerk.)

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:20.740 line:93%
Seriously.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.709 line:93%
- It's five seconds. - Excuse me?

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:27.110 line:93%
5 seconds is long for him. He usually appears for 4 seconds.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.949 line:93%
- Se Chan, you're laughing too loud. - It's funny.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.750 line:93%
(Meanwhile, the high-schooler, So Min is...)

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.089 line:93%
(letting her imagination run wild.)

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:40.230 line:93%
So Min, what are you drawing?

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.329 line:93%
I'm drawing an underwater scene.

00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:47.799 line:93%
But I can't come up with anything cruel.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:49.530 line:93%
Why would you come up with something cruel?

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.439 line:93%
- What's with you? - Don't do that.

00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:53.669 line:93%
Or...

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:56.780 line:93%
I'll make Jae Seok and Jong Kook kiss.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.780 line:93%
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook will kiss?)

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.110 line:93%
Gosh.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.549 line:93%
This show is for the ages of 12 and over.

00:11:04.549 --> 00:11:07.419 line:93%
Please remember that.

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:08.689 line:93%
(Disappointed)

00:11:08.689 --> 00:11:10.120 line:93%
My goodness.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.459 line:93%
Kwang Soo, why did you draw water bombs in the background?

00:11:13.459 --> 00:11:14.530 line:93%
You saw it right.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.159 line:93%
He doesn't realize he'll get hit with the water too.

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:17.230 line:93%
(Are you talking about these water bombs?)

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.659 line:93%
Fine, in my animal kingdom,

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.799 line:93%
there will be a water bomb above just the giraffe.

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:22.929 line:93%
I like that.

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:25.199 line:93%
Okay. You're not wearing anything in my drawing.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.470 line:93%
- What? - Nothing under that green jacket.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.110 line:93%
I'll remove the water bomb.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.010 line:93%
All right. Then I'll give you clothes.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.309 line:93%
Okay. That sounds good.

00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:36.720 line:93%
(I like Kwang Soo's idea.)

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.679 line:93%
Please present your ideas.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.720 line:93%
Mine is called...

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.319 line:93%
Running Man's Sea Story.

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:44.919 line:93%

00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:48.429 line:93%
(Running Man's Sea Story)

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.260 line:93%
- Sea Story is dangerous. - It's the name of an adult game.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.799 line:93%
(Even the title is problematic.)

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:55.530 line:93%
Why did she give it such a name?

00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:59.140 line:93%
- Everything she does... - Running Man Under the Sea.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.439 line:93%
Kwang Soo is seaweed.

00:12:02.439 --> 00:12:03.980 line:93%
(Kwang Soo is seaweed.)

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.380 line:93%
Make me into a living creature.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.049 line:93%

00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:08.150 line:93%

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.780 line:93%
He'll be standing on ice, wearing green tights.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.020 line:93%
Please make sure his underwear lines don't show.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.520 line:93%
- So Min. - He'll be painted green all over.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.429 line:93%
I would like you to make...

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:22.689 line:93%
his outfit moist.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.699 line:93%
As you expected, Se Chan will be a catfish.

00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:27.669 line:93%
Please prepare some mud.

00:12:27.669 --> 00:12:31.069 line:93%
- He'll be lying in mud. - Mud?

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:32.770 line:93%
- I hope she won't win. - Se Chan will...

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.039 line:93%
be covered in mud.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.110 line:93%
I think Se Chan will look cute.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.740 line:93%
Wearing all that costume, we'll appear for 0.1 seconds.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.949 line:93%
As Ji Hyo is a girl...

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:43.480 line:93%
Ji Hyo will be a red carp.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.150 line:93%
I want her costume to be covered with spangles.

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:48.049 line:93%
Don't be just nice to Ji Hyo.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.059 line:93%
So Min!

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:51.720 line:93%
Ji Hyo should look pretty.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.130 line:93%
She's happy she can wear spangles.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.230 line:93%
(She's happy.)

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:56.929 line:93%
Spangles are nice.

00:12:59.429 --> 00:13:01.929 line:93%
Jong Kook will be a rock.

00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:03.199 line:93%

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.439 line:93%
(I'm a rock?)

00:13:04.439 --> 00:13:06.740 line:93%
Like Gollum...

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.110 line:93%
Jong Kook doesn't expect much from you.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.110 line:93%
I want his costume to have a hole here.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.850 line:93%
Hey, we can't do that on a show for 12 and over.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.280 line:93%
- His chest and belly should show. - We can't show our skin.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.679 line:93%
- He'll be a rock. - Why...

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:23.120 line:93%
Why do you decide how much skin I should show?

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.289 line:93%
Like this.

00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:27.990 line:93%
Celebrities are sensitive about showing their skin.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.760 line:93%
Seok Jin will be sticking to Jong Kook's shoulder.

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:33.329 line:93%
- Me? - Yes.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.699 line:93%
- He's a sea urchin. - Can you show all that?

00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:38.169 line:93%
- In five seconds? - We have only five seconds.

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:40.110 line:93%
Everyone will appear at the same time.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.409 line:93%
Seok Jin will have to curl up.

00:13:42.409 --> 00:13:45.079 line:93%
His arms and legs should be inside the costume.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.780 line:93%

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.480 line:93%

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.980 line:93%
Make Seok Jin a part of a picture puzzle.

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:53.689 line:93%
- Will there be a prize? - Haha will...

00:13:53.689 --> 00:13:56.490 line:93%
be an octopus spitting ink.

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:59.860 line:93%
I was too nice.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.329 line:93%
- Mine is too nice too. - Give us five more minutes.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.000 line:93%
- Give us 5 more minutes. - Give us 10 more.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.030 line:93%
- No. - Mine is too nice.

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:10.140 line:93%
Also, look at Jae Seok.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.770 line:93%
He's an anchovy.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.309 line:93%
(Jae Seok is an anchovy.)

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.640 line:93%
- What are you talking about? - It suits him.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.610 line:93%
So Min is good at casting.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.409 line:93%
He looks like an anchovy.

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:24.449 line:93%
His costume has to be very tight.

00:14:24.449 --> 00:14:26.949 line:93%
It has to be really tight, so he looks very thin.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.620 line:93%
I can't have the shape of an anchovy.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.659 line:93%
The anchovy will be very tiny.

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:35.159 line:93%
(Tiny?)

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:37.000 line:93%
Why do you keep making me tiny?

00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:39.559 line:93%
Hey!

00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:43.140 line:93%
(Last fall, in the sweet potato field)

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.510 line:93%
(Jae Seok's is tiny.)

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.740 line:93%
(Hey, say it properly.)

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.010 line:93%
(His nickname became Small Jae Seok.)

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.110 line:93%
Why do you make me tiny?

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.449 line:93%
- Small Jae Seok. - Hey!

00:14:57.449 --> 00:14:59.350 line:93%
It's Small Jae Seok.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.949 line:93%
You did it in the chili pepper field too.

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:02.150 line:93%
(He's angry.)

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.390 line:93%
I mean...

00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:04.559 line:93%
Small Jae Seok.

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:06.689 line:93%
- Hold on. - It was a sweet potato field.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.789 line:93%
- A chili pepper field? - What's with him?

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:12.130 line:93%
- It wasn't a chili pepper field. - Did you just admit it?

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.000 line:93%
- This is an inferiority complex. - No, it's not that.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.900 line:93%
(I'm sure of it.)

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.199 line:93%
- No, I don't! - He feels inferior.

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:20.770 line:93%
So Min...

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.610 line:93%
Small Jae Seok. Gosh.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.480 line:93%
He's famous.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.110 line:93%
- He's famous? - Really?

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.449 line:93%
Everyone in this field knows.

00:15:29.409 --> 00:15:30.780 line:93%
What?

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.819 line:93%
(You are watching storyboards that are fit for those 12 and over.)

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:34.650 line:93%
- Has the word spread? - Yes.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.089 line:93%
I'll walk by, saying, "Running Man is for 12 and over."

00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:41.059 line:93%
(I'll just walk by.)

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:42.159 line:93%
What?

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:44.730 line:93%
There's still two more seconds.

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:49.069 line:93%
Then you'll just spit some ink.

00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:51.439 line:93%
(Octopus Haha will wrap it up.)

00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:55.140 line:93%
You can have two seconds to yourself.

00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:57.780 line:93%
How much ink will he have to spit?

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.209 line:93%
Please write, "12",

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:02.309 line:93%
with ink.

00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:03.880 line:93%
Why am I not unhappy?

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:05.350 line:93%
That was creative.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.250 line:93%
He's happy he can appear for two seconds.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.520 line:93%
It wasn't bad.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.390 line:93%
(Someone is furious.)

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.230 line:93%
So Min, you shouldn't be a frog.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.760 line:93%
That'd be too comfortable.

00:16:15.459 --> 00:16:17.100 line:93%
- This is not okay. - I shouldn't have gone first.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.230 line:93%
It wasn't a good idea.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.600 line:93%
(I shouldn't have gone first.)

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.030 line:93%
You might not see it well.

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:22.400 line:93%
Let me explain.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.199 line:93%
The title is, "There's a lot to Learn from Running Man".

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:28.640 line:93%
(There's a lot to Learn from Running Man.)

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.650 line:93%
I want to shoot it at Myeongjeong Hall in Changgyeong Palace.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.679 line:93%
- I know that place. - I want to shoot there.

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:38.949 line:93%
I'll be the king,

00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:41.620 line:93%
and the others will carry my palanquin.

00:16:41.819 --> 00:16:44.720 line:93%
In the opening scene,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.659 line:93%
we'll show Seok Jin's trophy.

00:16:46.659 --> 00:16:49.360 line:93%
And Seok Jin will smash it.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.630 line:93%
(Seok Jin will smash his own trophy.)

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.100 line:93%
- My trophy? - "I don't deserve this!"

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.500 line:93%
(I don't deserve this!)

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:01.169 line:93%
This is not mine!

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:03.740 line:93%
- It's okay. - He even treated us to dinner.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.309 line:93%
- I like that. - And...

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.510 line:93%
The servant who fans the king...

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.109 line:93%
will be Jong Kook.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.950 line:93%
- He'll be shirtless. - Hold on.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.490 line:93%
(Jong Kook will be shirtless.)

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.819 line:93%
- Why am I always shirtless? - This show is for 12 and over.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.589 line:93%
Jong Kook is shirtless in every scenario.

00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:22.160 line:93%
- You have no choice. - I can't.

00:17:22.389 --> 00:17:24.660 line:93%
Let's avoid going shirtless.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.399 line:93%
Haha, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo...

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.770 line:93%
will be horses.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.869 line:93%
- They'll pull the palanquin. - Goodness.

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:35.069 line:93%
- I'm a horse? - Here comes the climax.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.079 line:93%
I'll whip the horses, saying, "Let's go watch Running Man."

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.809 line:93%
The horses will say, "Running Man is for 12 and over."

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.750 line:93%
That's it.

00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:46.180 line:93%
It's not bad, is it?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.389 line:93%
Who will be whipped?

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.660 line:93%
Someone popular should be whipped.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.660 line:93%
You're right.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.990 line:93%
- So I chose Jae Seok. - Nice.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.829 line:93%
(As Jae Seok is popular, he'll be whipped.)

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:56.230 line:93%
I like that.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.500 line:93%
Okay. That was nice.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.670 line:93%
(Will Se Chan's dream come true?)

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:01.700 line:93%
Ji Hyo.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.539 line:93%
I think mine is the simplest and the most straightforward.

00:18:04.539 --> 00:18:07.339 line:93%
- What is it? - We'll be using our bodies.

00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:12.710 line:93%
(Use Your Bodies)

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.049 line:93%
This looks simple, but these letters are made of humans.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.480 line:93%
- It's us. - Are they bodies?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.119 line:93%
(Those letters are us?)

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:21.190 line:93%
Use a drone camera or something.

00:18:21.819 --> 00:18:25.319 line:93%
- 1, 2... - With our bodies?

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:26.760 line:93%
- Yes, with our bodies. - Really?

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.490 line:93%
- Wearing tights? - Yes.

00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:31.460 line:93%
Now that I think of it,

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.230 line:93%
maybe our faces should be covered too.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.230 line:93%
(Our faces should be covered too.)

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.139 line:93%
Then why does it have to be us?

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.440 line:93%
We don't have to do it.

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:41.609 line:93%
Hire some extras.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.780 line:93%
- Hire people. - No.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.510 line:93%
We'll show them...

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.510 line:93%
how well we can work together even without...

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.180 line:93%
- seeing each other's face. - It has a message.

00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:53.420 line:93%
What message?

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.220 line:93%
- Does that make sense? - It can be fun.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.349 line:93%
Does that make sense?

00:18:56.349 --> 00:18:58.490 line:93%
- I don't want to do this. - This really is for 12 and over.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.760 line:93%
- Everything we do is a penalty. - This is not okay.

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:04.799 line:93%
- This wasn't the intention. - Let's have one normal scenario.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.670 line:93%
It's not supposed to be like this.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.730 line:93%
I'm not going to make Jong Kook take off his shirt.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.569 line:93%
- That's right. - Everyone will be equal.

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:14.010 line:93%
- Everyone will be equal. - Exactly. You're so nice.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.240 line:93%
(You're so nice.)

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.910 line:93%
What is this? Are you guys together?

00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:20.879 line:93%
Is there something going on?

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.280 line:93%
Why do you say she's nice?

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.950 line:93%
She is nice.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.520 line:93%
(They've been suspicious since the fortune-telling.)

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.720 line:93%
You're nice.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.289 line:93%
At the end, we'll all do our symbolic pose.

00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:36.700 line:93%
We'll do the running pose.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.329 line:93%
I'll say, "Running Man is for 12 and over."

00:19:39.329 --> 00:19:40.530 line:93%
I like it.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.470 line:93%
I like the idea. It has a message.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:43.740 line:93%
It's touching.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.170 line:93%
I hate that it'll be shot at a gym.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.480 line:93%
- It's "Healthy Running Man". - I like the title.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.940 line:93%
These are treadmills.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.349 line:93%
(Healthy Running Man)

00:19:55.349 --> 00:19:57.480 line:93%
You drew yourself so cute.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.950 line:93%
That's not how your hair looks.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.149 line:93%
(It's too cute.)

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.849 line:93%
I'm cute.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.059 line:93%
It's simple. I'll be holding a 12 sign.

00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:10.760 line:93%
I'll say, "Running Man is for 12 and over," looking cute.

00:20:10.859 --> 00:20:13.399 line:93%
The rest will be running at full speed.

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:15.569 line:93%
(The others will be running at full speed.)

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.069 line:93%
We have to start again if we fall, right?

00:20:17.569 --> 00:20:18.740 line:93%
Yes.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.010 line:93%
(We can't do that.)

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.410 line:93%
So Min will be holding 12kg dumbbells.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.280 line:93%
She'll hold it in each hand.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.879 line:93%
It's for ages 12 and over.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:28.750 line:93%
Members will dress up as Young Gu.

00:20:29.309 --> 00:20:30.879 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:32.119 line:93%
(Dressing up as Young Gu is necessary.)

00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:33.649 line:93%
What about Kwang Soo?

00:20:33.889 --> 00:20:35.220 line:93%
- He doesn't need to dress up. - I see.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.089 line:93%
- Why not? - You already look like him.

00:20:37.089 --> 00:20:39.059 line:93%
I'm going to dress up too.

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:41.460 line:93%
- I'm jealous of you, Kwang Soo. - I'm going to dress up.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.530 line:93%
- I'm jealous of you. - I'm going to dress up.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.770 line:93%
It's simple. This is running backwards.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.839 line:93%
- Backwards? - Everyone's back is turned.

00:20:49.869 --> 00:20:50.869 line:93%
The faces aren't visible.

00:20:50.869 --> 00:20:52.039 line:93%
Why would we dress up as Young Gu?

00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:53.139 line:93%
There's no reason.

00:20:53.139 --> 00:20:55.369 line:93%
(There's no reason behind dressing up.)

00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:57.780 line:93%
Why would we do a makeup when we don't face the camera?

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.849 line:93%
We'll dress up anyway.

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:00.849 line:93%
That's terrible.

00:21:00.849 --> 00:21:03.049 line:93%
- We show the back of our heads. - This is upsetting.

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:05.220 line:93%
I think I was too nice.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.589 line:93%
Why did your storyboard change?

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.319 line:93%
- It keeps changing. - Mine is...

00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:12.289 line:93%
very simple, and there won't be any suffering.

00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:14.160 line:93%
It's called "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.160 line:93%
You'll play animals.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.559 line:93%
(Yu Jae Seok and the Animals)

00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:23.200 line:93%
I stand in the front.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.440 line:93%
I stand in front of the camera.

00:21:26.569 --> 00:21:30.010 line:93%
Jong Kook will either dress up as a cat on a stove...

00:21:30.579 --> 00:21:32.410 line:93%
- Jong Kook? - That's cute.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.149 line:93%
Seok Jin dresses up as an impala with a trophy on his head.

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:38.180 line:93%
(Seok Jin has a trophy on his head.)

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.680 line:93%
- He's a unicorn. - A unicorn?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.690 line:93%
- Pardon? - It's a unicorn.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.690 line:93%
He's an impala who received the Top Excellence Award.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:43.990 line:93%
- That's good. - And...

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.289 line:93%
So Min was a frog, but I changed it.

00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:50.160 line:93%
She'll be a parrot on a perch.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.829 line:93%
She'll be on an actual perch with a thin bar.

00:21:53.829 --> 00:21:57.139 line:93%
(It's a perch with a thin bar.)

00:21:57.369 --> 00:21:59.970 line:93%
- It won't be easy to balance. - It's impossible.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.839 line:93%
So Min has to keep her balance.

00:22:03.339 --> 00:22:06.079 line:93%
She has to hold the bar with her feet.

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:07.250 line:93%
Can you do it?

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.849 line:93%
You have to hold the bar...

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.619 line:93%
with your feet like this.

00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:13.520 line:93%
So Min has to hold onto the perch like a bird.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.720 line:93%
(She must stand on the perch.)

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.149 line:93%
She needs to practice.

00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:18.720 line:93%
Lastly, I'll come out.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.859 line:93%
When I shout, "Running Man," you express age 12.

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:24.099 line:93%
- With our body? - Yes.

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:25.500 line:93%
How?

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.569 line:93%
It's like Ji Hyo's.

00:22:26.569 --> 00:22:27.829 line:93%
Did you just make that up?

00:22:27.829 --> 00:22:29.099 line:93%
No, I didn't.

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:30.670 line:93%
You just made it up.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.569 line:93%
- Where is it written? - Come on.

00:22:32.569 --> 00:22:34.369 line:93%
- It was my original idea. - Stop applying others' ideas.

00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:35.670 line:93%
- I didn't. - Why would we do it?

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.740 line:93%
- The animals will make 12. - How?

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.809 line:93%
You have to come up with how.

00:22:39.879 --> 00:22:41.049 line:93%
We can't express 12.

00:22:41.049 --> 00:22:42.849 line:93%
How is it possible?

00:22:42.879 --> 00:22:45.020 line:93%
As a human being, I don't know. The animals...

00:22:45.379 --> 00:22:46.750 line:93%
- The animals... - You're the director.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.289 line:93%
How could you not know?

00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:50.190 line:93%
The animals will work together...

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.319 line:93%
- How can animals make 12? - to show 12.

00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:53.430 line:93%
Just do it!

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.559 line:93%
- How? - Just do it.

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:58.530 line:93%
- All right. - How can we make 12?

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:00.770 line:93%
I'll start up a fight.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.099 line:93%
(He'll start up a fight?)

00:23:02.099 --> 00:23:03.399 line:93%
What?

00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:05.500 line:93%
- What did you say? - I'll start up a fight.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.410 line:93%
You must show age 12.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.839 line:93%
Then I'll say, "Viewers of 12 years and older".

00:23:10.879 --> 00:23:13.180 line:93%
Take a look. Stop making things up.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.250 line:93%
That's all I have.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.579 line:93%
I changed the storyboard a little.

00:23:16.579 --> 00:23:18.220 line:93%
- Especially... - You changed a lot.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.690 line:93%
My idea was a beautiful birthday.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.319 line:93%
My title is "A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12".

00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:27.389 line:93%
(A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12)

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.829 line:93%
- That's my title. - What is it?

00:23:29.829 --> 00:23:31.500 line:93%
It means age 12.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.369 line:93%
(It has no other meaning.)

00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:35.730 line:93%
- It's sensible. - It doesn't make sense.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.770 line:93%
What doesn't?

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.869 line:93%
What about animals expressing age 12?

00:23:38.869 --> 00:23:41.339 line:93%
- It makes sense. - Nothing makes sense here.

00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:43.780 line:93%
What is "A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12"?

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.710 line:93%
If you're 12 years old, you should dress up as one.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.309 line:93%
You should dress up as a child.

00:23:48.309 --> 00:23:50.520 line:93%
- Me? - According to your title...

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.420 line:93%
- You're 12 years old. - I'm just me.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.589 line:93%
- No. - You're 12 years old.

00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:55.889 line:93%
You should put rouge on your cheeks and forehead.

00:23:55.889 --> 00:23:58.160 line:93%
Why would I? This is up to me.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.389 line:93%
(This is my storyboard.)

00:24:00.389 --> 00:24:03.089 line:93%
- It's because of the title. - You can't tell me what to do.

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:05.399 line:93%
- Seok Jin, listen. - You can't change it.

00:24:05.399 --> 00:24:07.599 line:93%
The title is "A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12".

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:09.329 line:93%
That means you're 12 years old.

00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:11.470 line:93%
- Okay, I'll accept that. - Okay.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.210 line:93%
(He acts cool.)

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.839 line:93%
- I'll accept one idea. - That's right.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:17.839 line:93%
I'll accept one.

00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:20.309 line:93%
You'll need a lot of Botox.

00:24:20.309 --> 00:24:22.680 line:93%
- I'm swollen from laser treatment. - Botox.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.680 line:93%
(He's swollen from a laser treatment.)

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.220 line:93%
- Next is... - What?

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.349 line:93%
Did you get a laser treatment?

00:24:28.349 --> 00:24:30.260 line:93%
I said that he'll need a lot of Botox.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.160 line:93%
He responded, "I got a laser treatment."

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.589 line:93%
(Seok Jin's response is "I got a laser treatment.")

00:24:34.589 --> 00:24:35.660 line:93%
I got a laser treatment.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.329 line:93%
- Goodness. - What is he talking about?

00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:40.770 line:93%
- Se Chan used to be a human being, - Human?

00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:42.369 line:93%
but he dresses up as Gollum.

00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:43.839 line:93%
(He changes Se Chan to Gollum.)

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:45.470 line:93%
- Gollum? - He washes my feet.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.740 line:93%
Gollum is an old character. Not many people know about it.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.740 line:93%
It's too old.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.579 line:93%
That's what I want.

00:24:51.579 --> 00:24:53.579 line:93%
(This is my idea.)

00:24:53.579 --> 00:24:55.079 line:93%
Children of age 12 won't know.

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:56.879 line:93%
I won't accept more than one suggestion.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.149 line:93%
- I only accept the makeup. - Okay.

00:24:59.149 --> 00:25:01.649 line:93%
Next, So Min...

00:25:01.889 --> 00:25:06.359 line:93%
used to be a dancer that the king adores.

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:09.460 line:93%
- That's a good role. - However, I changed it.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.399 line:93%
- To what? - She'll be an actor.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.329 line:93%
- She's reborn. - What kind of actress?

00:25:13.329 --> 00:25:14.829 line:93%
(Seok Jin changed her role.)

00:25:14.829 --> 00:25:15.829 line:93%
As the Joker.

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:17.799 line:93%
It's a role that I like.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.309 line:93%
She'll dress up as the Joker.

00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:21.309 line:93%
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:23.180 line:93%
The time setting is during Joseon Dynasty.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.240 line:93%
- The Joker shouldn't come out. - Of course.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.210 line:93%
It's not realistic.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.579 line:93%
The Joker comes out, and Rome comes out.

00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:31.849 line:93%
- Seok Jin. - Everything is included. It's okay.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.119 line:93%
Why are you nitpicking my idea?

00:25:35.349 --> 00:25:37.190 line:93%
- Kwang Soo. - Mine is very simple.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.289 line:93%
As you can see, my title is...

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:43.359 line:93%
"2018 Start Afresh".

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.899 line:93%
As you can see in the picture, water bombs are installed.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.430 line:93%
So Min wears Young Gu wig.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.539 line:93%
- Why? - Makeup is simple too.

00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:52.869 line:93%
- Jong Kook... - Why am I Young Gu?

00:25:52.869 --> 00:25:55.639 line:93%
wears a sleeveless shirt and tights. He's dressed.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:59.109 line:93%
Jae Seok wears no makeup except his green jacket.

00:25:59.109 --> 00:26:02.149 line:93%
(Jae Seok's costume is his green jacket.)

00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:03.950 line:93%
Bring that jacket. Joo Eun, you have to take it.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.149 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:07.119 line:93%
- What about the jacket? - It was the funniest.

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:09.319 line:93%
I don't believe this.

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:12.160 line:93%
All members will get water bombed.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.289 line:93%
A clean-looking Kwang Soo appears.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.960 line:93%
Present the age ratings, and frame out.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.099 line:93%
All I say is "Viewers".

00:26:19.129 --> 00:26:21.129 line:93%
- Who says age 12? - That's done by...

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.099 line:93%
- He added it. - each member.

00:26:23.099 --> 00:26:24.240 line:93%
(Each member says it.)

00:26:25.069 --> 00:26:29.369 line:93%
Members say each syllable, "Running Man is Age 12."

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.039 line:93%
Seok Jin is in Daegu. Jae Seok is in Busan.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.210 line:93%
Jong Kook is in Gwangju. Haha is in Haenam.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.349 line:93%
He's lost his mind.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.520 line:93%
- Stop playing. - Goodness.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.190 line:93%
The members getting a water bomb...

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.960 line:93%
won't be aired.

00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:46.490 line:93%
- What's the point... - After the water bomb...

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.190 line:93%
- of water bomb when it isn't aired? - That's right.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.960 line:93%
- I think it'll be fun. - Seriously.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.760 line:93%
(There's no other reason.)

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.829 line:93%
- That's cruel. - I'd feel satisfied.

00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:56.869 line:93%
What kind of idea is that?

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.369 line:93%
They'll be on camera after the water bomb.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.670 line:93%
Viewers.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.180 line:93%
- My goodness. - I put everything together.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.440 line:93%
- Okay. - That's all I have.

00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:07.579 line:93%
My original idea was something cute.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.149 line:93%
My original idea was...

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.079 line:93%
"Cute Running Man's Seafood Market".

00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:15.319 line:93%
- That's a good idea. - Everyone's costume was nice.

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:18.990 line:93%
As we walk and chitchat,

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.789 line:93%
I wanted to make it pretty.

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:21.789 line:93%
You changed it.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:25.000 line:93%
The more I listened to you, the angrier I got.

00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:27.200 line:93%
I completely changed it.

00:27:27.399 --> 00:27:31.099 line:93%
This is in one frame. It's a TV screen.

00:27:31.099 --> 00:27:33.240 line:93%
(Running Man's Age Rating)

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.940 line:93%
It's a PSA that viewers of Running Man must be over age 12.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.039 line:93%
It's a storyboard. The first scene is...

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:41.879 line:93%
Seok Jin who is smoking an electronic cigarette.

00:27:41.879 --> 00:27:43.250 line:93%
- It's age 12 years or older. - Is that okay?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.079 line:93%
Right. It's a public advertisement.

00:27:45.079 --> 00:27:47.289 line:93%
Next is Jae Seok watching pornography.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.889 line:93%
- Come on. - Ji Hyo is cursing while drunk.

00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:54.129 line:93%
Next is Kwang Soo and So Min who are fighting.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.359 line:93%
Se Chan writes bad comments on Seok Jin and So Min.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:00.200 line:93%
Next is Jong Kook being a bully.

00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:03.369 line:93%
These scenes are shown for one second.

00:28:03.369 --> 00:28:04.839 line:93%
Will you cross them out?

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:08.369 line:93%
Then I tear them all and jump out of the screen.

00:28:09.069 --> 00:28:13.149 line:93%
Then I say, "No, Running Man is for age 12 years or older."

00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:14.579 line:93%
That's it.

00:28:16.379 --> 00:28:20.490 line:93%
(Haha denounces the bad actions of adults.)

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.289 line:93%
That's complete nonsense.

00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:23.520 line:93%
- It's simple. - It's nonsense.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.559 line:93%
If you look carefully,

00:28:25.889 --> 00:28:29.260 line:93%
water bombs are installed everywhere.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.399 line:93%
After being aired for 1 second, they get a water bomb for 0.5 second.

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:33.770 line:93%
Then I come out of the screen.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.030 line:93%
- Come out of the screen, my foot. - I do.

00:28:37.099 --> 00:28:39.839 line:93%
Put ink inside Jae Seok's water bomb.

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:43.210 line:93%
(Haha won't tolerate Jae Seok.)

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.379 line:93%
There's also mud.

00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:46.579 line:93%
My goodness.

00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:49.410 line:93%
- There's also mud. - There's nothing good.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.220 line:93%
- It's hard to decide. - There's nothing good.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.690 line:93%
Will the idea that wins first place...

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.220 line:93%
be aired for one month?

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.289 line:93%
It'll be aired 8 times including Part 1 and 2.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.160 line:93%
- That's amazing. - I want to win first place today.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.660 line:93%
- Really? - I'm being serious.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.359 line:93%
Jae Seok can't win today...

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:06.230 line:93%
- I want to win. - unless we want to suffer.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.829 line:93%
There are ones who shouldn't win.

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:11.039 line:93%
I think Ji Hyo's is the worst. Our faces won't be shown.

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:13.369 line:93%
- Ji Hyo's is easy. - How can we make 12?

00:29:13.609 --> 00:29:15.970 line:93%
It's not about being simple.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.440 line:93%
There's nothing wrong with Ji Hyo's.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.109 line:93%
(There's nothing wrong with hers.)

00:29:19.109 --> 00:29:21.750 line:93%
- Are you in a relationship? - Will you act as a couple?

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.849 line:93%
What's going on?

00:29:22.849 --> 00:29:24.520 line:93%
There's not much to do for Ji Hyo's.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.490 line:93%
- All we do is dress up. - I wasn't going to say it.

00:29:26.649 --> 00:29:30.160 line:93%
I wasn't going to say it, but why are you together so often?

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.190 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.160 line:93%
You were together during the get-together.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.990 line:93%
- Are you in a relationship? - They're suspicious.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.930 line:93%
Will I lose all my money?

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.970 line:93%
- Lose what? - I bet all of my money...

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.770 line:93%
that they aren't in a relationship.

00:29:43.139 --> 00:29:48.139 line:93%
(Last Christmas, a romance began between Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

00:29:48.139 --> 00:29:54.180 line:93%
(Seok Jin bet all of his money that they aren't in a relationship.)

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.510 line:93%
I want Seok Jin's money.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.220 line:93%
Someone wrote that he wants to see me penniless.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.750 line:93%
(I want to see Seok Jin penniless.)

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.389 line:93%
- If you two are dating... - I'll add one more.

00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:06.490 line:93%
If they date...

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.990 line:93%
Seok Jin will be penniless.

00:30:08.089 --> 00:30:10.760 line:93%
He wanted them to be in a relationship.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.430 line:93%
Seok Jin won't dress up as an impala.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.500 line:93%
I'll make him penniless instead.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.240 line:93%
(Seok Jin turns into a penniless man instead.)

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:21.639 line:93%
Today's race to select the winner is called...

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.639 line:93%
The mission to win the TV rating notice is War of R Ddakji.

00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:27.450 line:93%
(War of R Ddakji)

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.549 line:93%
- "R Ddakiji"? - "R Ddakiji"?

00:30:28.649 --> 00:30:29.750 line:93%
Ddakji?

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.450 line:93%
- I'm good at that game. - Why are we playing that?

00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:34.649 line:93%
The member with the most ddakjis will win the race...

00:30:34.649 --> 00:30:36.520 line:93%
and become the director of the clip.

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:37.990 line:93%
- I have to win this. - Everyone will be...

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.520 line:93%
given 20 ddakjis to start.

00:30:39.829 --> 00:30:41.289 line:93%
Depending on the success of your mission,

00:30:41.289 --> 00:30:43.799 line:93%
you may be given more or forced to hand in your ddakjis.

00:30:43.899 --> 00:30:46.160 line:93%
- Let me hand them out first. - Okay.

00:30:46.569 --> 00:30:48.200 line:93%
- Look at this. - Give this to Se Chan.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.329 line:93%
This is for Kwang Soo.

00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:51.299 line:93%
- There are names on them. - Our ddakjis are in here too.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.210 line:93%
Goodness, these are real ddakjis.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:54.910 line:93%
My gosh. These used to come with snacks.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.069 line:93%
- These are the ones. - These are nice.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.740 line:93%
- Goodness. - These are nice.

00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:00.010 line:93%
If there are any extras, can you give me some?

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:02.780 line:93%
- These look amazing. - We wore a lot of costumes.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.720 line:93%
We did all sorts of things.

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:06.180 line:93%
Seok Jin...

00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:07.990 line:93%
must not have done much.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.760 line:93%
(But it seems Seok Jin must not have done much.)

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.359 line:93%
You used only three pictures for the rest of his ddakjis...

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.730 line:93%
while other members have about five photos.

00:31:14.829 --> 00:31:15.930 line:93%
Exactly.

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.129 line:93%
- I don't think I can get married. - Did you do that?

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:19.930 line:93%
I can't get married now.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.470 line:93%
(This photo from last August will fend men off.)

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.639 line:93%
Gosh, So Min.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.000 line:93%
Gosh, her photos are so funny.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.839 line:93%
(My goodness. Why did I do that?)

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.510 line:93%
I see. This is how I look like. Goodness.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.839 line:93%
Haha has the oddest one among us.

00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:33.410 line:93%
- His ddakjis... - All of mine are weird.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.280 line:93%
This one. I really hate this one.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.889 line:93%
- This photo. Seriously. - Haha.

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:42.119 line:93%
Haha, you look like a loser.

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:43.690 line:93%
(Your face looks like a loser's.)

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.960 line:93%
"A loser"?

00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:47.730 line:93%
(I respect his loser face.)

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:48.859 line:93%
Haha.

00:31:50.099 --> 00:31:51.399 line:93%
Now, I'll tell you the rules.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.299 line:93%
The first mission is...

00:31:53.299 --> 00:31:55.329 line:93%
Battle of 12.

00:31:55.329 --> 00:31:56.869 line:93%
(The 1st mission is Battle of 12.)

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.539 line:93%
You will make 4 teams of 2.

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:00.809 line:93%
Each team will invite guests who are related to the number, 12.

00:32:01.309 --> 00:32:02.809 line:93%
When you win the given challenge,

00:32:02.809 --> 00:32:04.940 line:93%
you will obtain R Ddakjis.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.910 line:93%
There are four keywords for guests you must invite.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.410 line:93%
You will make a team with the member who chose the same keyword.

00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:11.379 line:93%
You will personally invite guests who fit the description.

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:13.349 line:93%
The battle will 2 to 1.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.520 line:93%
The members who win the battle will earn 20 R Ddakjis.

00:32:16.589 --> 00:32:19.089 line:93%
We have to invite guests? We have to do that?

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.930 line:93%
Before you begin your mission,

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.799 line:93%
let us reveal the keywords related to the number 12.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.200 line:93%
- Should we all choose one? - Yes.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.899 line:93%
(2 members with the same keyword will make 1 team.)

00:32:28.899 --> 00:32:30.670 line:93%
(The partner they choose will play an important role today.)

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.839 line:93%
Should I stay away from hardcore members like Kwang Soo?

00:32:33.069 --> 00:32:34.270 line:93%
- Is this the keyword? - Yes.

00:32:34.309 --> 00:32:35.410 line:93%
(The partner they choose will play an important role today.)

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.780 line:93%
"A celebrity with a 12-year age gap"?

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.950 line:93%
(Jae Seok and So Min are a team.)

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.720 line:93%
"A celebrity who was born in December".

00:32:45.079 --> 00:32:47.250 line:93%
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook are a team.)

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:49.119 line:93%
My gosh, mine is hard.

00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:51.760 line:93%
(A celebrity who lives in the area at the 12th bus stop)

00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:53.930 line:93%
"Celebrity whose debut was 12 years ago".

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.859 line:93%
(Kwang Soo and Haha are a team.)

00:32:56.899 --> 00:32:58.660 line:93%
- It's going to be a long day. - Ji Hyo.

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:00.700 line:93%
- Did you get the same one? - Goodness!

00:33:01.869 --> 00:33:04.770 line:93%
- We played a similar one before. - Yes, we did.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.139 line:93%
- Seriously. - He introduced a wrong person.

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:08.210 line:93%
(Kwang Soo was exhausted then.)

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:12.240 line:93%
(Haha supposedly gave him the number for Yu Seung Woo, the singer.)

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.609 line:93%
(Haha gave him the number to "help" Kwang Soo last April.)

00:33:16.379 --> 00:33:20.250 line:93%
(Kwang Soo went to meet Seung Woo with a leery feeling of gratitude.)

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.660 line:93%
(However, "Lee" Seung Woo showed up.)

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:29.490 line:93%
(This was how the Tricky and Cunning Brotherhood was forged.)

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.930 line:93%
- He gave me a wrong number. - I gave him a different Seung Woo.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.470 line:93%
(The brotherhood is reunited. He's already feeling tired.)

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.099 line:93%
I had to shave on that day too.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.039 line:93%
Everyone, you will move to your designated vehicle for each team.

00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:39.740 line:93%
You can continue your discussion there.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.069 line:93%
All right.

00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:44.480 line:93%
(The mission for each team)

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.010 line:93%
- So Min. - Yes, Jae Seok?

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.250 line:93%
- I researched a while ago. - Yes?

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.079 line:93%
A celebrity who is 12 years older than me is...

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.349 line:93%
Lee Gyeong Gyu.

00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:54.720 line:93%
- I see. Lee Gyeong Gyu. - We have a 12-year age gap.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.859 line:93%
Or another celebrity is Chon Ho Jin who won the Grand Award.

00:33:57.859 --> 00:33:59.020 line:93%
(He won the Grand Award from KBS.)

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.160 line:93%
I have never met him in person.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.329 line:93%
- Really? - I've never had the pleasure.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.359 line:93%
I only met him in passing.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.670 line:93%
But I was never properly introduced to him.

00:34:06.829 --> 00:34:09.470 line:93%
- I've never worked with him before. - I'd like to meet him too.

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:11.600 line:93%
How old is 12 years older than your age?

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600 line:93%
It's 35 years old.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.939 line:93%
(It's 35 years old.)

00:34:13.939 --> 00:34:15.109 line:93%
- That's 12 years older than you? - Yes.

00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:16.109 line:93%
(But she was born in 1986.)

00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:18.280 line:93%
- 35 is 12 years older than you? - Yes.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.879 line:93%
Wait, no. It's 45 years old.

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:21.180 line:93%
- Don't you think that's too much. - I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.280 line:93%
Do you think you're in high school today?

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.280 line:93%
People who are 12 years younger than you are...

00:34:26.549 --> 00:34:28.290 line:93%
- 35 years old. - That's right.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:29.549 line:93%
People who are 12 years older than me are 45.

00:34:29.549 --> 00:34:31.019 line:93%
What year were they born?

00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:33.859 line:93%
(Who are some celebrities that are 12 years older than So Min?)

00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:35.660 line:93%
This celebrity is 45 years old.

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.200 line:93%
(That's right!)

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.629 line:93%
- That celebrity? - Yes.

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.200 line:93%
- Isn't that celebrity busy? - Hold on.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.600 line:93%
- Do you have the number? - That celebrity's phone number...

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.970 line:93%
is the only one I know among celebrities we mentioned so far.

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:46.510 line:93%
(Jae Seok has ties with this popular celebrity?)

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.370 line:93%
(We are on our way to meet you now!)

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.740 line:93%
First off, let's get moving.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.910 line:93%
We'll go to Gangnam Station first.

00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:53.450 line:93%
First off,

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:56.350 line:93%
- we'll give you two stickers. - Okay.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.319 line:93%
What are the stickers for?

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.220 line:93%
Put one of the stickers on your body,

00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:02.990 line:93%
and think about whether you want to put the other sticker...

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.220 line:93%
- on the guest or not. - We can put it anywhere?

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.729 line:93%
Yes, you can put anywhere on the guest's body.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.760 line:93%
I can think about this and put it on when I want to, correct?

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.459 line:93%
Whoever puts the sticker on the guest within five minutes...

00:35:10.459 --> 00:35:11.600 line:93%
will get to team up with the guest.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.760 line:93%
After finding out the mission,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.269 line:93%
if you believe teaming up with each other is better,

00:35:14.269 --> 00:35:15.930 line:93%
you don't have to put the sticker on the guest.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.669 line:93%
So Min, think about this then.

00:35:17.669 --> 00:35:19.240 line:93%
It might be better if we don't put this on the guest.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.709 line:93%
You and I can partner up and win the game.

00:35:21.609 --> 00:35:23.040 line:93%
It's better to win 20 ddakjis.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.209 line:93%
But only first place matters.

00:35:25.209 --> 00:35:26.510 line:93%
(Winning them together doesn't do me any good.)

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.680 line:93%
You have a point, but...

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.310 line:93%
Then why don't you help me?

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.680 line:93%
My plan is better than yours.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.319 line:93%
I think...

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:34.450 line:93%
Well,

00:35:34.749 --> 00:35:36.890 line:93%
I really want to see you in the anchovy costume.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:41.189 line:93%
(I'm sorry. I really want to see you in the anchovy costume.)

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:42.589 line:93%
Hey.

00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:44.560 line:93%
I also want to see you on the perch.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.930 line:93%
I want you to...

00:35:47.269 --> 00:35:49.870 line:93%
perch on that rod. Mark my words.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.499 line:93%
Small Jae Seok, Small Jae Seok.

00:35:51.499 --> 00:35:54.540 line:93%
(Her teasing is on repeat.)

00:35:55.269 --> 00:35:56.979 line:93%
My goodness, have you gone mad?

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.640 line:93%
Seriously. This isn't a double entendre.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.249 line:93%
- I have never... - But you do mean that.

00:36:01.249 --> 00:36:04.220 line:93%
Anyway, stop trying to cause misunderstandings.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.720 line:93%
Then I will make you a whale.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.850 line:93%
Stop it!

00:36:08.319 --> 00:36:09.620 line:93%
Stop bringing that up.

00:36:09.859 --> 00:36:11.760 line:93%
This doesn't suit the program.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.530 line:93%
What are you talking about? You don't want to be an anchovy...

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.089 line:93%
- Just stop talking. - or a whale. What do you want?

00:36:15.089 --> 00:36:16.760 line:93%
Just drop this.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.330 line:93%
Then what will you be in the sea?

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.560 line:93%
I told you to stop.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.530 line:93%
This is exactly why you cannot win this mission.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:22.999 line:93%
Don't win today.

00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:24.899 line:93%
I'll win today. Unbelievable.

00:36:24.899 --> 00:36:25.939 line:93%
(Will her story come true?)

00:36:26.269 --> 00:36:27.839 line:93%
Well, I looked up celebrities...

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:29.470 line:93%
born in December.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.140 line:93%
- There were so many. - Daniel was born in December.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.850 line:93%
(He was born on December 10.)

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.479 line:93%
- Should I call Daniel? - I really like him.

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:38.180 line:93%
I love him too.

00:36:38.419 --> 00:36:40.249 line:93%
- Psy was born in December too. - Psy?

00:36:40.249 --> 00:36:42.290 line:93%
-Hey, Kye Sang was born in December. - Yes?

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.089 line:93%
- Kye Sang was born in December. - Hey!

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:45.919 line:93%
- Yoon Kye Sang. - Let's meet him.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.729 line:93%
I watched "The Outlaws" like crazy.

00:36:47.729 --> 00:36:49.490 line:93%
He was born in December.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.499 line:93%
(The leading role in the hit move, "The Outlaws" last year)

00:36:52.499 --> 00:36:57.269 line:93%
(Yoon Kye Sang played the role of his lifetime, Jang Chen.)

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.499 line:93%
Why don't you send him a text first?

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.410 line:93%
- "Kye Sang, it's Seok Jin." - You want me to do it?

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:03.680 line:93%
No, I don't want to do it.

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.410 line:93%
I have never met him in person though.

00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:07.549 line:93%
- Seok Jin. - What?

00:37:07.549 --> 00:37:08.680 line:93%
You won the Top Excellence Award.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.249 line:93%
Regardless of my award,

00:37:10.249 --> 00:37:11.519 line:93%
- I can't do this. - Right now,

00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:13.149 line:93%
- you're the recipient of the award. - But still...

00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:15.549 line:93%
- I freeze in front of famous stars. - Seok Jin.

00:37:15.749 --> 00:37:17.260 line:93%
Come on. Give him a call. You said you'll do it.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.760 line:93%
- I'll give you the number. Come on. - Let's give it a shot.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.729 line:93%
He's not picking up.

00:37:21.729 --> 00:37:23.729 line:93%
He might not answer an unknown number.

00:37:27.729 --> 00:37:29.299 line:93%
- Hello? - Yes?

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.640 line:93%
Is this Mr. Yoon Kye Sang?

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.240 line:93%
(He's careful.)

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.769 line:93%
- Yes, this is he. - Hey.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:36.979 line:93%

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.359 line:93%
I'm sorry, Jang Chen.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.859 line:93%
What are you doing now?

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.430 line:93%
I just finished working out.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:56.600 line:93%
- I see. - Now, I'm on my way home.

00:37:56.729 --> 00:37:58.229 line:93%
- Were you at the gym? - Yes.

00:37:58.229 --> 00:37:59.899 line:93%
Well, you know...

00:38:00.269 --> 00:38:02.100 line:93%
I feel so bad for asking you this.

00:38:02.229 --> 00:38:06.839 line:93%
We have to meet with a celebrity who was born in December.

00:38:07.439 --> 00:38:09.740 line:93%
- I see. - Yes, but...

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.939 line:93%
Don't feel like you have to say yes.

00:38:12.939 --> 00:38:14.310 line:93%
It's probably not possible for us to meet...

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.280 line:93%
with you since you're not ready now, right?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.680 line:93%
(Can we come meet you now?)

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:24.760 line:93%
(Will their spur-of-the-moment meeting be accomplished?)

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.959 line:93%
Right now, I'm naked though.

00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:28.060 line:93%
- You're naked? My apologies. - I see.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.629 line:93%
(He's naked since he has to take a shower after his workout.)

00:38:31.629 --> 00:38:32.830 line:93%
I'm so sorry, Kye Sang.

00:38:33.129 --> 00:38:35.129 line:93%

can you say one of your famous lines?

00:38:39.439 --> 00:38:41.769 line:93%
(He has many famous lines that contributed to the film's success.)

00:38:41.769 --> 00:38:44.109 line:93%
(Which one will he say?)

00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:47.280 line:93%
I came here to collect my money. Why should I care about that?

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.019 line:93%
(He sounds fierce.)

00:38:50.019 --> 00:38:53.049 line:93%
(Goodness! He perfectly reenacts the scene.)

00:38:54.049 --> 00:38:56.490 line:93%
I came here to collect my money. Why should I care about that?

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.089 line:93%
(He's true to his nickname, Kye Sang, the almighty!)

00:38:59.089 --> 00:39:00.260 line:93%
- Kye Sang. - But...

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.729 line:93%
Thank you so much for this.

00:39:01.729 --> 00:39:03.729 line:93%
Sorry to point this out, but did you say the line naked?

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:05.229 line:93%
(Sorry to point this out, but did you say the line naked?)

00:39:05.229 --> 00:39:07.870 line:93%
I bet people are looking at him in the locker room.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.269 line:93%
You were about to take a shower.

00:39:09.269 --> 00:39:11.339 line:93%
I apologize for asking you to do this,

00:39:11.339 --> 00:39:13.910 line:93%

He was born in December.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.089 line:93%
It's Jang Hyuk.

00:39:28.089 --> 00:39:29.450 line:93%

- Great. - He's filming a drama now.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.260 line:93%
Right. That's true.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.870 line:93%
So I have to see if he's available or not.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.970 line:93%

go visit you and film us playing a game.

00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:08.229 line:93%
But it would be hard since you're filming a drama now, right?

00:40:08.229 --> 00:40:11.899 line:93%
(I know you're filming now, but can you meet with us briefly?)

00:40:11.899 --> 00:40:12.899 line:93%
- If... - If you come here,

00:40:12.899 --> 00:40:14.870 line:93%

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.580 line:93%
By the way, what will I be doing?

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.609 line:93%
(He's nervous.)

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:31.919 line:93%
We don't know yet.

00:40:31.919 --> 00:40:34.220 line:93%
- We don't know either. - It's a game.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.249 line:93%
Running Man makes me worried.

00:40:36.249 --> 00:40:38.089 line:93%
It'll be okay.

00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:39.459 line:93%
You don't have to worry.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.729 line:93%
I'm supposed to be charismatic.

00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:43.260 line:93%

00:40:46.669 --> 00:40:47.729 line:93%
I know that.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.229 line:93%
We'll protect your charisma.

00:40:49.229 --> 00:40:50.439 line:93%
All right.

00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:51.999 line:93%

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.910 line:93%

(Blow up 10 plastic bottles with your nose.)

00:41:08.689 --> 00:41:10.919 line:93%
He has to blow up plastic bottles with his nose?

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:14.790 line:93%
I'm sorry, Hyuk.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.260 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.660 line:93%
He said, "Running Man makes me worried."

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.200 line:93%
Gosh.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.269 line:93%
I'm so sorry.

00:41:21.269 --> 00:41:22.470 line:93%
Can't you give us another one?

00:41:22.669 --> 00:41:23.740 line:93%
Didn't you hear him?

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.399 line:93%
- Exactly. He was worried. - He's supposed to be charismatic.

00:41:26.709 --> 00:41:28.310 line:93%
Let's do another one.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.339 line:93%
- Give us another one. - He can't do this.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.709 line:93%
Let's go. Where's the bus stop? Do we have to go down?

00:41:35.709 --> 00:41:38.149 line:93%
There's one there, and there's another one there.

00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:40.749 line:93%
We have to go 12 stops.

00:41:40.749 --> 00:41:44.260 line:93%
We'll go 12 stops and look for someone who lives there.

00:41:44.459 --> 00:41:46.160 line:93%
If we can't find anyone, we'll come back 12 stops...

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.629 line:93%

00:41:47.629 --> 00:41:50.229 line:93%

00:41:59.399 --> 00:42:01.209 line:93%

00:43:20.249 --> 00:43:21.249 line:93%
Really?

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.319 line:93%
Did you debut after getting business cards?

00:43:23.319 --> 00:43:24.660 line:93%
I did.

00:43:25.689 --> 00:43:26.790 line:93%
- Really? - Yes.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:32.330 line:93%
(Ji Hyo used to receive a lot of business cards.)

00:43:33.129 --> 00:43:36.499 line:93%
I can't believe I'm with a person who debuted after getting a card.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.700 line:93%
It's true. I debuted after getting a business card.

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.839 line:93%
- This brings back memories. - It's nice.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.780 line:93%
Ewha Womans University is nice too. It would've been great...

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.810 line:93%
- to come here. - You're right.

00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:47.979 line:93%
(Meanwhile)

00:43:47.979 --> 00:43:51.549 line:93%
I have an exhausting partner today.

00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:53.649 line:93%
I wanted to take it easy today.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:55.790 line:93%
- Gosh, today is... - Goodness.

00:43:56.959 --> 00:44:00.229 line:93%
I really wanted to do well in today's game.

00:44:00.229 --> 00:44:02.030 line:93%
It's going to be ugly.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.899 line:93%
- Let's not do that again. - Seriously.

00:44:03.899 --> 00:44:05.430 line:93%
- Let's play fair. - Don't get cute.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.299 line:93%
- Don't be too mean. - It depends on you.

00:44:08.299 --> 00:44:10.799 line:93%
Let's not even start it.

00:44:10.939 --> 00:44:12.040 line:93%
Let's play fair.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.769 line:93%
- It's a promise. - Seriously.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:15.609 line:93%
Let's show them what fair play is.

00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:17.640 line:93%
We learned everything from you.

00:44:18.939 --> 00:44:20.450 line:93%
(Haha is the legendary betrayer.)

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.080 line:93%
Who do you think we learned it from?

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.450 line:93%
You learned it too well.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:30.290 line:93%
- Learn only good things. - You amaze me.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.919 line:93%
(Teacher versus student)

00:44:31.919 --> 00:44:34.160 line:93%
- It's true. - You're unbelievable.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:37.859 line:93%
We have to choose the right partner.

00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:40.129 line:93%
- Someone who debuted 12 years ago. - 12 years.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.569 line:93%
Someone who debuted 12 years ago...

00:44:43.299 --> 00:44:46.399 line:93%
Let's do this. Let's start over.

00:44:46.399 --> 00:44:48.040 line:93%
You and me...

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.479 line:93%
I really want to win.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.879 line:93%
I love my scenario.

00:44:53.709 --> 00:44:54.879 line:93%
- Haha. - Yes?

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:57.749 line:93%
If I win, I'll take out your water bomb.

00:44:57.749 --> 00:45:00.120 line:93%
(If I win, I'll take out your water bomb.)

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.490 line:93%
(Tempting)

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.519 line:93%
Kwang Soo usually...

00:45:03.519 --> 00:45:05.620 line:93%
- keeps his promises. - I promise.

00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:07.129 line:93%
I'll take yours out.

00:45:07.129 --> 00:45:08.189 line:93%
(Trust me.)

00:45:08.189 --> 00:45:11.530 line:93%
When I say, "Running Man is for 12 and over..."

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.899 line:93%
"12 and over".

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.870 line:93%
- Can I say, "and over"? - You can say, "12".

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.899 line:93%
(You can say, "12".)

00:45:16.899 --> 00:45:17.970 line:93%
12?

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.169 line:93%
Okay.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.939 line:93%
- Keep your promise. - "Running Man is for..."

00:45:21.939 --> 00:45:24.810 line:93%
- "12..." - "and over."

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.450 line:93%
Can I say something else?

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.549 line:93%
It sounds weird.

00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:30.879 line:93%
(It doesn't sound nice.)

00:45:30.879 --> 00:45:31.879 line:93%
All right.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:34.350 line:93%
- You can say, "for 12 and over". - Okay.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.760 line:93%
- "Running Man is..." - "For 12 and over."

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.589 line:93%
(Running Man is for 12 and over.)

00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:41.260 line:93%
It doesn't sound right.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:42.589 line:93%
That part is too important.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.499 line:93%
You start.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.330 line:93%
- "Running Man is..." - "For 12 and over."

00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:49.470 line:93%
- Like this? - It was nice.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.040 line:93%
- I'll keep my promise. - Thank you.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.839 line:93%
I'll remove your water bomb.

00:45:54.439 --> 00:45:56.479 line:93%
I found Lee Sang Yeob.

00:45:56.979 --> 00:45:57.979 line:93%
He was on Running Man recently, right?

00:45:57.979 --> 00:46:01.049 line:93%
He debuted in 2007.

00:46:01.049 --> 00:46:02.479 line:93%
Really?

00:46:02.479 --> 00:46:03.519 line:93%
(This is his 12th year.)

00:46:04.819 --> 00:46:10.120 line:93%
(He recently did funny impressions on Running Man.)

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.359 line:93%
It's not a bad idea, is it? He even won an award recently.

00:46:14.359 --> 00:46:15.859 line:93%
That's right.

00:46:16.189 --> 00:46:17.799 line:93%
We should call him and congratulate him.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.700 line:93%
It's Sang Yeob.

00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:23.569 line:93%
Hello.

00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:24.600 line:93%
(He's curt.)

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.740 line:93%
Hello, this is Running Man. We're Haha...

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.870 line:93%
And Kwang Soo.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.979 line:93%
- Hi, Sang Yeob. - Hello.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.540 line:93%
- Hello. - Hi.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.549 line:93%
(Gentle)

00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:35.850 line:93%
Hi. It's nice to speak to you.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:37.720 line:93%
His voice changed instantly.

00:46:38.049 --> 00:46:40.350 line:93%
- Nice to hear from you. - It gave me goosebumps.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.390 line:93%
What's your blood type?

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.790 line:93%
(Random)

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:45.760 line:93%
(Why is he asking that question?)

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.359 line:93%
It's B.

00:46:48.729 --> 00:46:51.399 line:93%
- That's right. You were chosen... - Yes.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.799 line:93%
as the blood-type B star of 2017.

00:46:55.799 --> 00:46:56.970 line:93%
Wait.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.069 line:93%
(The blood-type B star of 2017?)

00:46:59.069 --> 00:47:01.569 line:93%
(What?)

00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:02.740 line:93%
Congratulations...

00:47:03.609 --> 00:47:05.740 line:93%
- on getting chosen. - on getting chosen.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.910 line:93%
(Congratulations)

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.580 line:93%
Congratulations.

00:47:09.709 --> 00:47:12.419 line:93%
The competition was fierce among blood-type B stars.

00:47:12.419 --> 00:47:14.120 line:93%
- Really? - You got second place,

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.689 line:93%
and Jae Seok got third place.

00:47:16.089 --> 00:47:18.959 line:93%
(Both of them are telling lies so skillfully.)

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.359 line:93%
Are you shooting right now?

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:23.359 line:93%
- We are. - You are?

00:47:23.359 --> 00:47:26.669 line:93%
We're visiting our favorite guests.

00:47:26.669 --> 00:47:29.629 line:93%
And you were chosen as the star of 2017.

00:47:29.769 --> 00:47:32.640 line:93%
We have a prize for you.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.709 line:93%
(We have a prize for you.)

00:47:34.709 --> 00:47:35.939 line:93%
- Do you have time? - I can come to you.

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.339 line:93%
- Is that okay? - Should we meet halfway?

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.080 line:93%
Should we do that?

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.450 line:93%
We'll be having tteokbokki in Hongdae. Can you come there?

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.149 line:93%
- All right. - You have to hurry.

00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:46.950 line:93%
- Okay. - It's my treat.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:49.390 line:93%
We even have a trophy.

00:47:50.689 --> 00:47:53.260 line:93%
(They're even lying about a trophy.)

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.760 line:93%
- Anyway, I'll see you there. - Okay.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.700 line:93%
- See you there. - But...

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.459 line:93%
you have to hurry.

00:47:59.729 --> 00:48:02.430 line:93%
- Okay. - Thank you. I love you.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.299 line:93%
See you soon. Bye.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.040 line:93%
Don't ever do this to me.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.580 line:93%
- Let me explain. - Don't do this to me.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.939 line:93%
It's because of you.

00:48:11.939 --> 00:48:14.109 line:93%
- You played along so well. - Don't do this to me.

00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:16.479 line:93%
- I couldn't stop lying. - Haha is scary.

00:48:16.479 --> 00:48:18.049 line:93%
If our careers fail,

00:48:18.049 --> 00:48:19.780 line:93%
- we could con someone together. - Let's do that.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.819 line:93%
Let's con Seok Jin.

00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:22.319 line:93%
- We have to. - Okay.

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:23.519 line:93%
How are we going to make a trophy?

00:48:23.519 --> 00:48:24.959 line:93%
(How are we going to keep our promise?)

00:48:24.959 --> 00:48:28.390 line:93%
Let me tell you what the game is about.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.899 line:93%
(The game is revealed.)

00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:36.470 line:93%
"Three Choices".

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.769 line:93%
"You'll make three choices at a cafe."

00:48:38.839 --> 00:48:40.709 line:93%
"If you make the same choice, you succeed."

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.580 line:93%
"The team that succeeds twice first will win."

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.080 line:93%
- What does that mean? - I don't understand.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.249 line:93%
If we're choosing, it means that this is a roulette.

00:48:48.249 --> 00:48:51.780 line:93%
Yes. We'll explain the details later.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.519 line:93%
The team that wins two points first will win.

00:48:53.519 --> 00:48:56.689 line:93%
You'll compete 2 to 1, so your victory lies with your partner.

00:48:57.019 --> 00:49:01.160 line:93%
That means you have a better chance if you're two people.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.660 line:93%
(It's better to have a guest.)

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.569 line:93%
(Look at him.)

00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:08.569 line:93%
Hey.

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.240 line:93%
- I can't do this with you. - What?

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.939 line:93%
Don't do that.

00:49:13.269 --> 00:49:14.640 line:93%
Your face says everything.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.810 line:93%
Please explain the situation with the subtitles.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.709 line:93%
- Who made it more obvious? - Haha.

00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:23.549 line:93%
Let's stick together. There are many games left.

00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:24.549 line:93%
(Don't betray me.)

00:49:24.649 --> 00:49:26.220 line:93%
I never said I wouldn't.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:28.019 line:93%
Let's stick together.

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:31.160 line:93%
(Thinking)

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.760 line:93%
- Look at him. - Let's take it easy.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.660 line:93%
- Let's play fair. - Seriously.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:35.990 line:93%
I'm already tired.

00:49:36.859 --> 00:49:38.260 line:93%
(He wants us to stick together?)

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.499 line:93%
Hey, give it to me.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.930 line:93%
(Give your sticker to me.)

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.169 line:93%
You don't need it anyway.

00:49:43.169 --> 00:49:44.370 line:93%
Can we choose one another?

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:46.769 line:93%
- Yes. - It's between us.

00:49:46.769 --> 00:49:48.010 line:93%
- Let's exchange the stickers. - Sure.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:49.410 line:93%
Do we really need to do this?

00:49:50.209 --> 00:49:52.209 line:93%
- What? - It's like you don't trust me.

00:49:53.609 --> 00:49:55.149 line:93%
- I do. - I...

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.419 line:93%
Why wouldn't I trust you?

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.319 line:93%
- You lost it? - Where is it?

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:01.689 line:93%
(You lost it?)

00:50:01.689 --> 00:50:02.749 line:93%
It was here before.

00:50:02.749 --> 00:50:05.260 line:93%
(Your sticker suddenly disappeared?)

00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:07.030 line:93%
Can you give me one more?

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:09.490 line:93%
Hey.

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:11.359 line:93%
(Forget it.)

00:50:11.799 --> 00:50:14.330 line:93%
What's with him? He's tiring me out.

00:50:14.799 --> 00:50:17.069 line:93%
Fine, let's go our separate ways.

00:50:18.769 --> 00:50:20.010 line:93%
- You're... - Haha.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.810 line:93%
- That's not it. - You're...

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.109 line:93%
That's not why. Let's exchange.

00:50:24.209 --> 00:50:26.040 line:93%
- What's wrong with you? - Let's exchange.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.410 line:93%
I didn't know it was here. Let's exchange.

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:29.950 line:93%
- Just do it. - I'm angry,

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:31.519 line:93%
so I'll keep all.

00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:32.979 line:93%
(They're sneaky traitors.)

00:50:32.979 --> 00:50:34.120 line:93%
Wait a minute.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.049 line:93%
- What do you mean? - Let me keep them.

00:50:36.049 --> 00:50:37.290 line:93%
Don't you trust me?

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.359 line:93%
I think I'm angry at you.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:40.959 line:93%
Don't talk to me for a while.

00:50:42.959 --> 00:50:45.229 line:93%
Come on, Haha. Fine.

00:50:46.799 --> 00:50:48.399 line:93%
(Team Jae Seok and So Min)

00:50:48.399 --> 00:50:50.399 line:93%
Here's the mission.

00:50:50.399 --> 00:50:51.399 line:93%
What is it?

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.410 line:93%
Your mission is called...

00:50:53.609 --> 00:50:55.810 line:93%
Karaoke of 12.

00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:57.109 line:93%
- Karaoke? - What's that?

00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:59.580 line:93%
You'll take turns singing.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.979 line:93%
The person with the higher score wins.

00:51:02.379 --> 00:51:05.120 line:93%
The winner will get 20 ddakjis.

00:51:05.134 --> 00:51:09.134 line:93%

00:51:09.149 --> 00:51:12.160 line:93%
(They exchange a look of competitiveness.)

00:51:13.859 --> 00:51:16.290 line:93%
Jae Seok, let's sing together.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.499 line:93%
You don't sing well.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:18.729 line:93%
I sing well.

00:51:18.729 --> 00:51:19.760 line:93%
What can you sing?

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:24.470 line:93%
I sang with Kim Dong Wan in the past.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.609 line:93%
- Kim Dong Wan? - Kim Dong Wan of Shinhwa.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:28.839 line:93%
- Dong Wan? - Yes.

00:51:28.839 --> 00:51:29.979 line:93%
Sing the song.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:33.580 line:93%
It's been a long time, so I forgot, but I added harmony.

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.979 line:93%
- No way. - Look it up.

00:51:35.979 --> 00:51:37.919 line:93%
You'll find it on the internet.

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:39.479 line:93%
- Really? - Yes.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.120 line:93%
- Did you sing with him? - Yes.

00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:43.490 line:93%
I trained to be a singer in high school.

00:51:44.419 --> 00:51:45.689 line:93%
- But I was a faceless singer. - Really?

00:51:45.689 --> 00:51:47.260 line:93%
(She was a faceless singer.)

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:50.530 line:93%
- It was popular back then. - "Faceless singer"?

00:51:50.959 --> 00:51:54.899 line:93%
The producer told me to stay as a faceless singer...

00:51:54.899 --> 00:51:57.470 line:93%
and an actress, and then to reveal my identity later.

00:51:57.799 --> 00:51:58.970 line:93%
I worked with him,

00:51:59.569 --> 00:52:03.479 line:93%
but the producer ran away to Japan because I had no talent.

00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:07.410 line:93%
Your relationships always end that way.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.879 line:93%
It's the other person who runs away.

00:52:09.879 --> 00:52:11.419 line:93%
I was quite surprised.

00:52:11.419 --> 00:52:12.749 line:93%
- There it is. - Right?

00:52:12.979 --> 00:52:14.620 line:93%
(He presses play.)

00:52:15.149 --> 00:52:16.350 line:93%
That's my voice.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:17.790 line:93%
Which part?

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.129 line:93%
(She hums.)

00:52:20.129 --> 00:52:21.129 line:93%
The female voice.

00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:24.660 line:93%
Do you hear the harmony?

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.100 line:93%
When will your part start?

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.100 line:93%
This is my part.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:39.810 line:93%
(It's been a long time)

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:43.780 line:93%
(I feel free at this moment)

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.780 line:93%
That's me.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.620 line:93%
(For those who may be flustered...)

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:53.229 line:93%
("He Starlight" by Kim Dong Wan featuring Jeon So Min)

00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:54.589 line:93%
My part starts again.

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:56.959 line:93%
Listen closely.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.299 line:93%
(The times when I walked alone)

00:53:00.299 --> 00:53:01.299 line:93%
It's me.

00:53:01.799 --> 00:53:03.999 line:93%
(Aren't I a good singer?)

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.370 line:93%
Did you add the harmony?

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:07.470 line:93%
Sing it again.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.709 line:93%
The times when I walked alone

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:12.740 line:93%
(He hits her.)

00:53:13.379 --> 00:53:15.749 line:93%
(Stop playing around)

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.149 line:93%
That's so fake.

00:53:20.249 --> 00:53:22.319 line:93%
There's no sincerity in your voice.

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:23.319 line:93%
(She lacks sincerity.)

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.419 line:93%
- Do you know what? - What?

00:53:25.419 --> 00:53:30.100 line:93%
It's a song called "Doll" by Shin Hye Sung and Lee Jee Hoon.

00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:32.560 line:93%
- Yes. - It's the epitome of harmony.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.600 line:93%
People sing it at the karaoke.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.299 line:93%
Will you add harmony while I sing it?

00:53:37.569 --> 00:53:38.970 line:93%
Do I have to?

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.310 line:93%
(So Min considers it the epitome of harmony.)

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:45.879 line:93%
(Will So Min and Jae Seok sing such a sweet song?)

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.879 line:93%
I'll miss you

00:53:48.879 --> 00:53:52.379 line:93%
It cannot be helped

00:53:52.979 --> 00:53:54.689 line:93%
(Here's my high note.)

00:53:55.519 --> 00:53:58.990 line:93%
When I'm exhausted from crying for so long

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.530 line:93%
I'll look for you

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.600 line:93%
(She gives up.)

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.999 line:93%
When will you sing in harmony?

00:54:04.999 --> 00:54:06.399 line:93%
You sing horribly.

00:54:06.399 --> 00:54:09.700 line:93%
I'm singing in low pitch for the background bass.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.939 line:93%
I can sing "Spring" in harmony very well.

00:54:11.939 --> 00:54:14.769 line:93%
Can you sing it? I'm good at singing it in harmony.

00:54:14.769 --> 00:54:16.010 line:93%
Really? I'll try again.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.140 line:93%
Start.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.740 line:93%
In deep mountains

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.149 line:93%
- Stop it. - There's a spring

00:54:20.249 --> 00:54:22.109 line:93%
- That's not in harmony. - Who drinks from there?

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.720 line:93%
Stop it.

00:54:24.019 --> 00:54:25.479 line:93%
Stop it already.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.390 line:93%
Stop it. Goodness.

00:54:27.519 --> 00:54:28.950 line:93%
That's enough.

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:30.519 line:93%
- Stop singing. - It's harmony.

00:54:30.519 --> 00:54:33.019 line:93%
- Jae Seok. - Just stop it.

00:54:33.019 --> 00:54:34.030 line:93%
Try it again.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:36.729 line:93%
I'll sing in harmony instead. This is how you do it.

00:54:36.959 --> 00:54:40.100 line:93%
You sing like this to add harmony.

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.700 line:93%
Start.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:46.100 line:93%
In deep mountains, there's a spring

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.939 line:93%
Who drinks from there?

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:52.939 line:93%
(They sing harmoniously as they play with notes.)

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.979 line:93%
Destroying eyes

00:54:54.979 --> 00:54:56.950 line:93%
Those are not the lyrics.

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:58.479 line:93%
(What did you say?)

00:54:59.249 --> 00:55:02.390 line:93%
(Something seems terribly wrong.)

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:04.120 line:93%
What are you singing?

00:55:04.419 --> 00:55:06.629 line:93%
What kind of lyrics are those?

00:55:07.129 --> 00:55:08.129 line:93%
What are you?

00:55:08.129 --> 00:55:09.899 line:93%
(They arrive in Gangnam.)

00:55:10.999 --> 00:55:12.729 line:93%
What are some other songs?

00:55:12.729 --> 00:55:14.299 line:93%
(They select songs while waiting.)

00:55:14.299 --> 00:55:15.899 line:93%
I should sing "Darling".

00:55:16.839 --> 00:55:18.040 line:93%
That's a good one.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.040 line:93%
(Knocking)

00:55:19.094 --> 00:55:22.463 line:93%
(The guest is 45 years old.)

00:55:24.999 --> 00:55:29.199 line:93%

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.240 line:93%
(He also has amazing singing skills.)

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:37.980 line:93%
(Who is today's special guest who has it all?)

00:55:40.039 --> 00:55:41.240 line:93%
That's a good one.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.140 line:93%
(The special guest who waited for the team came...)

00:55:43.394 --> 00:55:46.763 line:93%
(The guest is 45 years old.)

00:55:46.899 --> 00:55:51.099 line:93%
(It's a star who will shine this year.)

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.140 line:93%
(He also has amazing singing skills.)

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:59.980 line:93%
(Who is today's special guest who has it all?)

00:56:01.949 --> 00:56:03.750 line:93%
Young Chul.

00:56:04.001 --> 00:56:06.371 line:93%
The one who will...

00:56:06.471 --> 00:56:10.081 line:93%
shine in 2018 is me.

00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:12.710 line:93%
(The most popular comedian singer, Kim Young Chul)

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:14.280 line:93%
- Hello, Young Chul. - Come here.

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.650 line:93%
Did you bring an English newspaper on purpose?

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.690 line:93%
I always read the newspaper.

00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:19.751 line:93%
It's in English.

00:56:21.061 --> 00:56:23.521 line:93%
- I always read the news. - Where did you get it?

00:56:23.521 --> 00:56:24.931 line:93%
There's an English newspaper in his bag.

00:56:24.931 --> 00:56:26.460 line:93%
Stop it.

00:56:26.927 --> 00:56:28.468 line:93%
There's his wallet too.

00:56:28.927 --> 00:56:30.367 line:93%
He has so much cash.

00:56:30.468 --> 00:56:32.168 line:93%
Stop it. He just arrived.

00:56:32.168 --> 00:56:33.898 line:93%
You take out his wallet as soon as he arrives.

00:56:33.898 --> 00:56:36.367 line:93%
- Is that her habit? - No.

00:56:36.367 --> 00:56:38.137 line:93%
Put the newspaper back in.

00:56:38.137 --> 00:56:39.907 line:93%
Thank you, Young Chul.

00:56:39.907 --> 00:56:42.008 line:93%
I was really surprised.

00:56:42.008 --> 00:56:43.048 line:93%
Why?

00:56:43.177 --> 00:56:45.747 line:93%
This is why I thought you called me.

00:56:45.747 --> 00:56:46.747 line:93%
What?

00:56:46.878 --> 00:56:49.488 line:93%
Did you hear what happened at the Entertainment Awards Ceremony?

00:56:49.488 --> 00:56:51.488 line:93%
- What? - Am I regular?

00:56:51.758 --> 00:56:54.287 line:93%
(She sticks a team sticker.)

00:56:54.758 --> 00:56:57.088 line:93%
What does R mean?

00:56:57.457 --> 00:56:59.727 line:93%
Does it stand for regular?

00:57:00.157 --> 00:57:02.128 line:93%
- Did I become a regular member? - What did you do?

00:57:02.128 --> 00:57:04.838 line:93%
- Am I a regular member now? - What did you do?

00:57:04.997 --> 00:57:06.267 line:93%
Are you selecting another member?

00:57:06.468 --> 00:57:09.168 line:93%
So Min and Young Chul will be a team.

00:57:09.168 --> 00:57:10.168 line:93%
(So Min and Young Chul versus Jae Seok)

00:57:10.168 --> 00:57:13.338 line:93%
Jae Seok will be on his own.

00:57:13.477 --> 00:57:15.407 line:93%
- Did you do something wrong? - So Min.

00:57:15.407 --> 00:57:16.477 line:93%
(Just wait, and see.)

00:57:16.847 --> 00:57:18.677 line:93%
(Their singing competition starts.)

00:57:18.677 --> 00:57:21.688 line:93%
All I have to do is score higher.

00:57:21.688 --> 00:57:22.688 line:93%
(So Min and Young Chul's average score versus Jae Seok's score)

00:57:24.758 --> 00:57:26.218 line:93%
(She clicks her tongue.)

00:57:26.218 --> 00:57:28.157 line:93%
Hello. 1, 2.

00:57:28.358 --> 00:57:31.927 line:93%
Microphone testing, 1, 2, thank you.

00:57:33.028 --> 00:57:35.097 line:93%
What did you say?

00:57:35.968 --> 00:57:38.767 line:93%
(She prepares a lot for her bad singing skills.)

00:57:39.838 --> 00:57:40.867 line:93%
Is this a warm-up?

00:57:40.867 --> 00:57:41.867 line:93%
(They warm up first.)

00:57:41.867 --> 00:57:42.867 line:93%
Go.

00:57:42.867 --> 00:57:46.477 line:93%
("Ring" has an unforgettable melody.)

00:57:47.577 --> 00:57:50.648 line:93%
(He exaggerates his dance moves from the start.)

00:57:56.488 --> 00:57:57.957 line:93%
(Excited)

00:57:58.457 --> 00:58:01.387 line:93%
(It's a crazy dance.)

So Min.

00:58:06.457 --> 00:58:07.457 line:93%
(She turns.)

00:58:08.628 --> 00:58:09.628 line:93%
What was that?

00:58:10.927 --> 00:58:12.637 line:93%
(She pokes.)

00:58:12.637 --> 00:58:13.838 line:93%
(She does a finish.)

00:58:15.168 --> 00:58:17.977 line:93%
(Jae Seok loves this type of dance.)

00:58:19.137 --> 00:58:21.307 line:93%
(They remember the steps.)

00:58:22.508 --> 00:58:24.048 line:93%
I can also make a whirlwind.

00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:25.977 line:93%
(She spins.)

00:58:26.177 --> 00:58:27.177 line:93%
It's a whirlwind.

00:58:27.878 --> 00:58:30.688 line:93%
(It's So Min's whirlwind dance.)

00:58:32.088 --> 00:58:33.988 line:93%
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

00:58:34.157 --> 00:58:36.057 line:93%
(What is Young Chul score?)

00:58:36.057 --> 00:58:37.387 line:93%
- It's 100. - I never sang it at a karaoke.

00:58:37.387 --> 00:58:38.758 line:93%
- You got 100. - It's 100.

00:58:38.758 --> 00:58:41.097 line:93%
- So Min's dance was good. - Isn't it charming?

00:58:41.468 --> 00:58:42.468 line:93%
(More than Young Chul's singing...)

00:58:42.468 --> 00:58:45.068 line:93%
- 1, 2. - You have to move forward.

00:58:45.298 --> 00:58:46.668 line:93%
You can also do it this way.

00:58:48.867 --> 00:58:49.968 line:93%
You can also do it this way.

00:58:50.568 --> 00:58:53.677 line:93%
(She mimics various creatures.)

00:58:53.738 --> 00:58:55.048 line:93%

00:58:55.307 --> 00:58:56.307 line:93%
Let's see.

00:58:56.378 --> 00:58:57.378 line:93%
Does the competition start?

00:58:57.378 --> 00:58:59.247 line:93%
Yes, we'll each sing a song.

00:58:59.577 --> 00:59:01.747 line:93%
We'll take the average of your scores...

00:59:01.948 --> 00:59:03.148 line:93%
and compare it to mine.

00:59:03.148 --> 00:59:04.387 line:93%
I'm nervous.

00:59:04.688 --> 00:59:06.287 line:93%
Young Chul scored high.

00:59:06.287 --> 00:59:07.358 line:93%
"Ring".

00:59:07.358 --> 00:59:08.887 line:93%
(She gets energy from Young Chul.)

00:59:09.528 --> 00:59:11.088 line:93%
- Are we starting? - Yes.

00:59:11.398 --> 00:59:13.657 line:93%
She'll start. Singing in Jin Young's version is good.

00:59:13.657 --> 00:59:15.528 line:93%
(The winner gets 20 ddakjis.)

00:59:15.827 --> 00:59:18.968 line:93%
(How much will So Min score?)

00:59:20.537 --> 00:59:21.537 line:93%
So Min.

00:59:21.537 --> 00:59:22.568 line:93%
(She transforms.)

00:59:24.168 --> 00:59:25.278 line:93%
(Ring)

00:59:28.548 --> 00:59:29.548 line:93%
(He gets up.)

00:59:30.148 --> 00:59:32.218 line:93%
(The old men can't resist dancing.)

00:59:33.648 --> 00:59:37.218 line:93%
(Her singing is rather stable in the beginning.)

00:59:38.517 --> 00:59:40.787 line:93%
(I'm your older sister)

00:59:42.287 --> 00:59:45.957 line:93%
(She reaches the climax as she sings passionately.)

00:59:48.568 --> 00:59:50.628 line:93%
(Get ready.)

00:59:50.628 --> 00:59:52.267 line:93%
(Ring)

00:59:53.168 --> 00:59:55.037 line:93%
(They waited for this part.)

00:59:55.037 --> 00:59:56.867 line:93%
Let's go

00:59:57.568 --> 00:59:59.177 line:93%
(Spinning)

00:59:59.177 --> 01:00:02.577 line:93%
(She's out of breath.)

01:00:02.577 --> 01:00:04.577 line:93%
(They're out of breath,)

01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:07.247 line:93%
(but they can't stop dancing.)

01:00:07.818 --> 01:00:11.088 line:93%
(The past 4 minutes felt like 4 hours.)

01:00:11.818 --> 01:00:13.218 line:93%
(It's time to reveal the score.)

01:00:13.218 --> 01:00:14.858 line:93%
- What is her score? - Please.

01:00:14.858 --> 01:00:16.287 line:93%
(Panting)

01:00:16.287 --> 01:00:19.157 line:93%
(From the middle, she gave up on singing and focused on dancing.)

01:00:19.727 --> 01:00:20.858 line:93%
What is my score?

01:00:20.858 --> 01:00:22.767 line:93%
85. It's 85.

01:00:22.767 --> 01:00:25.597 line:93%
(Compared to her singing skill, 85 percent is generous.)

01:00:25.597 --> 01:00:27.537 line:93%
85. It's 85.

01:00:28.907 --> 01:00:30.068 line:93%
- 85 percent? - Is that good?

01:00:30.707 --> 01:00:32.407 line:93%
- Is it not bad? - We needed to get over 90.

01:00:32.407 --> 01:00:34.907 line:93%
(Jae Seok and Young Chul are left. What will they get?)

01:00:35.747 --> 01:00:36.948 line:93%
- Here? - Please have a seat.

01:00:36.948 --> 01:00:38.218 line:93%
(Haha and Kwang Soo are going to meet Sang Yeob.)

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.778 line:93%
Let's make a paper award.

01:00:41.448 --> 01:00:43.747 line:93%
(They make a paper award from a blank paper.)

01:00:43.747 --> 01:00:44.988 line:93%
Do you want to make it?

01:00:45.088 --> 01:00:46.918 line:93%
- Do you want to draw? I'll make it. - Okay.

01:00:47.218 --> 01:00:53.358 line:93%
(It's a Blood Type B Star Award, so they are very sincere.)

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.198 line:93%
You can do it comfortably.

01:00:57.497 --> 01:01:01.537 line:93%
(He's creating a prestigious-looking trophy from the drama awards.)

01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:02.867 line:93%
This is so sloppy.

01:01:04.838 --> 01:01:07.537 line:93%
(Award ceremonies are about the sincerity, not the awards.)

01:01:07.537 --> 01:01:09.907 line:93%
- It's all about the heart. - I know.

01:01:10.608 --> 01:01:11.948 line:93%
But that's really bad.

01:01:12.648 --> 01:01:15.448 line:93%
Look at yours.

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:17.318 line:93%
I have no time. I'm almost done.

01:01:17.318 --> 01:01:20.457 line:93%
(It's entirely handmade.)

01:01:20.457 --> 01:01:21.557 line:93%
I'm almost done.

01:01:22.688 --> 01:01:25.227 line:93%
This is really bad.

01:01:27.597 --> 01:01:29.427 line:93%
Doesn't it look pretty nice?

01:01:29.927 --> 01:01:32.738 line:93%
(It's a water bottle trophy.)

01:01:32.968 --> 01:01:34.168 line:93%
It's pretty good.

01:01:35.907 --> 01:01:37.207 line:93%
(He gets up.)

01:01:37.938 --> 01:01:39.008 line:93%
Isn't this nice?

01:01:40.477 --> 01:01:41.608 line:93%
It is, right?

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:43.747 line:93%
Blood Type B Star Award.

01:01:43.747 --> 01:01:46.117 line:93%
(This award is presented for your talent and wit on Running Man.)

01:01:47.148 --> 01:01:48.287 line:93%
Haha.

01:01:48.548 --> 01:01:50.247 line:93%
That looks good.

01:01:50.818 --> 01:01:52.657 line:93%
- He might cry. - Right?

01:01:52.657 --> 01:01:54.088 line:93%
(It's a more prestigious-looking trophy decorated with a wreath.)

01:01:54.088 --> 01:01:55.157 line:93%
Put on a sticker.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:58.827 line:93%
(Sang Yeob will be happy, right?)

01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:03.128 line:93%
This came off.

01:02:03.867 --> 01:02:06.438 line:93%
(Let's see.)

01:02:06.438 --> 01:02:08.407 line:93%
Hold on.

01:02:09.568 --> 01:02:10.608 line:93%
Hold on.

01:02:11.338 --> 01:02:13.278 line:93%
- When did it come off? - I'm missing this.

01:02:13.778 --> 01:02:15.048 line:93%
Am I not supposed to have it on me?

01:02:15.048 --> 01:02:16.407 line:93%
Come on.

01:02:16.407 --> 01:02:17.608 line:93%
(We're both experts. Why are you doing this?)

01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:19.418 line:93%
- Don't do this. - It really came off.

01:02:20.318 --> 01:02:21.688 line:93%
Do I not need it? If not...

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:23.887 line:93%
He's a bit strange.

01:02:24.918 --> 01:02:26.088 line:93%
Get up.

01:02:26.457 --> 01:02:27.858 line:93%
I'm serious.

01:02:27.918 --> 01:02:28.988 line:93%
I don't have it.

01:02:30.787 --> 01:02:32.028 line:93%
I'm serious. I don't have it.

01:02:32.628 --> 01:02:34.097 line:93%
If you don't have it,

01:02:34.457 --> 01:02:36.727 line:93%
you need another one...

01:02:36.727 --> 01:02:38.137 line:93%
to be on the same team as other people with the same color.

01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:39.968 line:93%
It's his fault that he lost it.

01:02:40.267 --> 01:02:41.338 line:93%
(Where is it?)

01:02:41.338 --> 01:02:42.468 line:93%
Are you going to put it on?

01:02:45.008 --> 01:02:46.778 line:93%
It must be here somewhere. Where is it?

01:02:46.778 --> 01:02:48.247 line:93%
(It must be here. Where is it?)

01:02:49.948 --> 01:02:52.318 line:93%
Come here.

01:02:52.318 --> 01:02:53.448 line:93%
I really don't have it.

01:02:53.448 --> 01:02:54.477 line:93%
You punk.

01:02:54.477 --> 01:02:56.287 line:93%
(He discovers the trick.)

01:02:56.287 --> 01:02:57.418 line:93%
Do you want to die?

01:02:57.418 --> 01:02:58.517 line:93%
I don't have it.

01:02:58.918 --> 01:03:00.957 line:93%
(Do you want to die?)

01:03:00.957 --> 01:03:02.758 line:93%
- What's that? There it is. - My gosh.

01:03:03.327 --> 01:03:04.957 line:93%
Goodness.

01:03:04.997 --> 01:03:06.398 line:93%
- Do you think I did it? - Never mind.

01:03:06.528 --> 01:03:07.597 line:93%
Don't talk.

01:03:07.597 --> 01:03:09.698 line:93%
- It fell, so I sat on it. - It's okay.

01:03:09.698 --> 01:03:11.097 line:93%
- Haha. - I'm not talking to him.

01:03:11.097 --> 01:03:13.568 line:93%
- You're mistaken. I sat on it. - I won't talk to him.

01:03:13.568 --> 01:03:15.137 line:93%
I didn't know I sat on it.

01:03:15.938 --> 01:03:17.108 line:93%
You...

01:03:17.508 --> 01:03:18.608 line:93%
I'm truly innocent.

01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:20.938 line:93%
You are...

01:03:20.938 --> 01:03:22.608 line:93%
(Goodness)

01:03:22.608 --> 01:03:24.677 line:93%
You are such a weird guy.

01:03:24.878 --> 01:03:26.318 line:93%
Aren't you going to give me your sticker?

01:03:26.318 --> 01:03:28.418 line:93%
(You promised.)

01:03:29.648 --> 01:03:31.088 line:93%
Why would I give you mine?

01:03:31.688 --> 01:03:34.387 line:93%
He's here. Sang Yeob is here.

01:03:35.688 --> 01:03:37.327 line:93%
- Hello. - Welcome.

01:03:37.327 --> 01:03:39.128 line:93%
- Hello. - Congratulations.

Congratulations.

01:03:41.727 --> 01:03:45.867 line:93%
(Congratulations, Sang Yeob.)

01:03:47.637 --> 01:03:49.367 line:93%
(What is going on?)

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.468 line:93%
"Congratulations."

01:03:51.137 --> 01:03:53.278 line:93%

01:04:09.028 --> 01:04:10.157 line:93%
Let's take a picture.

01:04:11.957 --> 01:04:13.028 line:93%
(The tricksters get into position for a picture.)

01:04:13.028 --> 01:04:14.128 line:93%
Turn.

01:04:14.128 --> 01:04:15.367 line:93%
(The tricksters get into position for a picture.)

01:04:15.367 --> 01:04:16.468 line:93%
Long time, no see.

01:04:21.637 --> 01:04:23.537 line:93%
(They try to take Sang Yeob away.)

01:04:23.537 --> 01:04:24.707 line:93%
I stuck it on him!

01:04:25.108 --> 01:04:26.778 line:93%
(He sticks the team sticker.)

01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:29.048 line:93%
(Kwang Soo's sticker)

01:04:29.508 --> 01:04:31.148 line:93%
I stuck it on him. I did it first.

01:04:31.448 --> 01:04:32.577 line:93%
Haha...

01:04:33.278 --> 01:04:34.847 line:93%
Haha did something.

01:04:35.188 --> 01:04:36.218 line:93%
He knew I was going to stick the sticker,

01:04:36.218 --> 01:04:38.287 line:93%
so he put my sticker on himself.

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:39.457 line:93%
He is...

01:04:39.718 --> 01:04:41.258 line:93%
- a dirty human being. - When did you see it?

01:04:41.358 --> 01:04:43.057 line:93%
- He's a dirty human being. - When did you see it?

01:04:43.057 --> 01:04:45.097 line:93%
(What was Haha's strategy that Kwang Soo found out?)

01:04:45.097 --> 01:04:47.597 line:93%
(Kwang Soo is going to betray me anyway.)

01:04:47.597 --> 01:04:48.668 line:93%
(Sly)

01:04:48.668 --> 01:04:50.367 line:93%
(He took off his own sticker...)

01:04:50.367 --> 01:04:54.037 line:93%
(and put on Kwang Soo's sticker.)

01:04:54.037 --> 01:04:56.938 line:93%
(Even if Kwang Soo betrayed him first,)

01:04:56.938 --> 01:04:58.438 line:93%
(Sang Yeob would have been on Haha's team.)

01:04:58.438 --> 01:05:00.008 line:93%
(Sang Yeob would have been on Haha's team.)

01:05:00.008 --> 01:05:02.108 line:93%
- He's a dirty human being. - When did you see it?

01:05:02.477 --> 01:05:03.878 line:93%
What's going on?

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:05.778 line:93%
Is Kwang Soo's sticker on Sang Yeob?

01:05:05.778 --> 01:05:07.918 line:93%
- Yes. - He tricked me.

01:05:09.088 --> 01:05:11.287 line:93%
Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo are on the same team.

01:05:11.287 --> 01:05:13.188 line:93%
- Yes. - Haha is on his own.

01:05:13.188 --> 01:05:14.927 line:93%
(I'm on my own.)

01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:15.988 line:93%
Oh, gosh.

01:05:15.988 --> 01:05:18.097 line:93%
- Congratulations, Sang Yeob. - Thank you.

01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:20.157 line:93%
Congratulations.

01:05:21.468 --> 01:05:23.628 line:93%
(How could you do this to me?)

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:25.738 line:93%
- You are... - No, Haha.

01:05:26.168 --> 01:05:27.238 line:93%
Think about it.

01:05:27.367 --> 01:05:29.137 line:93%
I'm guilty too.

01:05:30.767 --> 01:05:32.677 line:93%
Let's ask Sang Yeob to show us.

01:05:33.177 --> 01:05:34.977 line:93%
He can do impressions of people.

01:05:34.977 --> 01:05:36.347 line:93%
After Kim Hak Do...

01:05:36.378 --> 01:05:38.977 line:93%
After Kim Hak Do and Jeong Jong Chul, he's the best.

01:05:39.148 --> 01:05:41.048 line:93%
It's true.

01:05:41.048 --> 01:05:42.387 line:93%
That's the order.

01:05:42.387 --> 01:05:44.517 line:93%
He has a new impression.

01:05:44.517 --> 01:05:47.358 line:93%
- That day, So Min did... - Oh, right.

01:05:47.418 --> 01:05:49.387 line:93%
"I have two bullets."

01:05:50.258 --> 01:05:53.657 line:93%
(There was an impression battle during the filming.)

01:05:54.057 --> 01:05:55.767 line:93%
I have two bullets.

01:05:57.327 --> 01:06:00.597 line:93%
(It's an impression of Lee Jung Jae on "Assassination".)

01:06:00.597 --> 01:06:03.508 line:93%
(He strongly expresses injustice.)

01:06:04.938 --> 01:06:07.008 line:93%
I was impressed, so I worked on it.

01:06:07.637 --> 01:06:09.378 line:93%
I'm sorry, Jung Jae.

01:06:09.378 --> 01:06:11.247 line:93%
(How is Sang Yeob's impression of Jung Jae on "Assassination"?)

01:06:11.247 --> 01:06:13.448 line:93%
"I have two bullets."

01:06:13.448 --> 01:06:15.488 line:93%
Goodness.

01:06:15.488 --> 01:06:17.588 line:93%
"I picked these guys,"

01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:18.718 line:93%
"Your Honor."

01:06:18.718 --> 01:06:20.017 line:93%
He's trying so hard.

01:06:20.457 --> 01:06:25.528 line:93%
(This is the class of the Grand Award recipient.)

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:28.198 line:93%
- There are so many people watching. - Excuse us.

01:06:28.198 --> 01:06:29.468 line:93%
Isn't he great?

01:06:29.468 --> 01:06:31.068 line:93%
- Isn't he good? - Thank you.

01:06:31.068 --> 01:06:32.497 line:93%
It was Lee Jung Jae.

01:06:32.497 --> 01:06:34.597 line:93%
Please say a few words in Jang Hyuk's voice.

01:06:35.137 --> 01:06:36.307 line:93%
I think he'll be good.

01:06:37.568 --> 01:06:39.508 line:93%
Thank you.

01:06:41.407 --> 01:06:42.878 line:93%
(They're amazed.)

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:44.918 line:93%
I didn't know I was going to get such a great award.

01:06:46.247 --> 01:06:49.418 line:93%
Thank you. "Un Nyun"!

01:06:50.818 --> 01:06:51.957 line:93%
(The line from "The Slave Hunters" is always funny.)

01:06:51.957 --> 01:06:54.457 line:93%
I'm sorry, sir.

01:06:54.457 --> 01:06:56.227 line:93%
Thank you.

01:06:56.227 --> 01:06:57.628 line:93%
That was so similar.

01:06:57.628 --> 01:06:59.827 line:93%
(Actor Lee Sang Yeob works hard to develop more impressions.)

01:06:59.827 --> 01:07:01.698 line:93%
- This is the first game. - I don't 'know what to do.

01:07:01.698 --> 01:07:04.798 line:93%
The three of you can order a drink each...

01:07:05.497 --> 01:07:07.367 line:93%
and give your credit cards to the barista.

01:07:07.367 --> 01:07:09.468 line:93%
If your card is chosen, you lose.

01:07:12.077 --> 01:07:13.778 line:93%
Yes. Really?

01:07:14.177 --> 01:07:15.177 line:93%
What's going on?

01:07:15.177 --> 01:07:16.278 line:93%
(If there are two members in your team, the chance doubles.)

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.077 line:93%
Then is it better to have more people?

01:07:20.148 --> 01:07:22.188 line:93%
Isn't it a disadvantage to have more?

01:07:22.188 --> 01:07:23.218 line:93%
(It's more disadvantageous to have more people.)

01:07:23.747 --> 01:07:25.918 line:93%
(I tried hard to get Sang Yeob on my team.)

01:07:25.918 --> 01:07:27.887 line:93%
Isn't it better to have more people?

01:07:27.887 --> 01:07:29.088 line:93%
Gosh, this is great.

01:07:29.387 --> 01:07:30.557 line:93%
It's a great game.

01:07:30.628 --> 01:07:32.258 line:93%
This one's really good.

01:07:33.327 --> 01:07:34.597 line:93%
(They learn a lesson on virtue and vice.)

01:07:34.597 --> 01:07:35.927 line:93%
This is so much fun.

01:07:36.068 --> 01:07:37.298 line:93%
I have two cards.

01:07:38.398 --> 01:07:39.497 line:93%
I have two cards.

01:07:39.497 --> 01:07:41.307 line:93%
- Yes. - Stop it.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.537 line:93%
He doesn't care about winning.

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.368 line:93%
- He doesn't care. - I have one.

01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:46.108 line:93%
I have one.

01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:47.377 line:93%
Hold on.

01:07:47.377 --> 01:07:49.278 line:93%
I don't know what to do. I just got here.

01:07:49.448 --> 01:07:51.748 line:93%
This is mine, and this is Kwang Soo's.

01:07:51.748 --> 01:07:52.917 line:93%
(They mix up their credit cards.)

01:07:52.917 --> 01:07:55.248 line:93%
(Haha, Sang Yeob, Kwang Soo)

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:56.587 line:93%
Let's go.

01:07:56.587 --> 01:07:58.358 line:93%
(The game of random chance begins.)

01:07:58.358 --> 01:07:59.958 line:93%
There are three cards.

01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:01.188 line:93%
There are three cards.

01:08:01.387 --> 01:08:03.158 line:93%
- Let's have something sweet. - Yes.

01:08:03.158 --> 01:08:04.227 line:93%
Let's have a cake.

01:08:04.288 --> 01:08:07.227 line:93%
Let's see. I want Sang Yeob to order.

01:08:07.757 --> 01:08:09.828 line:93%
- Me? - Yes. I want to buy you something.

01:08:10.597 --> 01:08:13.597 line:93%
Do you want to take the order from Jang Hyuk,

01:08:13.637 --> 01:08:16.007 line:93%
- Jung Woo Sung, or Lee Jung Jae? - Jung Woo Sung.

01:08:16.137 --> 01:08:18.007 line:93%
- Jung Woo Sung. - Okay.

01:08:18.337 --> 01:08:21.448 line:93%
Can I have a tiramisu first?

01:08:22.677 --> 01:08:24.278 line:93%
He does it right away.

01:08:24.278 --> 01:08:25.517 line:93%
He doesn't say no.

01:08:26.177 --> 01:08:27.448 line:93%
He's the same.

01:08:28.087 --> 01:08:29.818 line:93%
Drinks? What about drinks?

01:08:29.948 --> 01:08:31.387 line:93%
Order drinks in Jang Hyuk's voice.

01:08:31.387 --> 01:08:33.017 line:93%
Jang Hyuk.

01:08:34.188 --> 01:08:36.587 line:93%
- Can I have iced Americano? - Me too.

01:08:36.688 --> 01:08:39.927 line:93%
Can I have three iced Americano?

01:08:40.127 --> 01:08:41.828 line:93%
That came out of nowhere.

01:08:42.797 --> 01:08:43.927 line:93%
That's it.

01:08:43.998 --> 01:08:45.837 line:93%
We have to pay.

01:08:45.837 --> 01:08:47.467 line:93%
(It's time to pay. The barista chooses the loser.)

01:08:47.467 --> 01:08:49.337 line:93%
Here you go. Please choose what you like.

01:08:49.738 --> 01:08:51.708 line:93%
- You can choose any. - Choose any.

01:08:52.778 --> 01:08:54.748 line:93%
(Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob have a 66.66-percent chance...)

01:08:54.748 --> 01:08:57.007 line:93%
(while Haha has a 33.33-percent chance.)

01:08:57.007 --> 01:08:58.847 line:93%
- You can choose any. - Choose any.

01:09:01.648 --> 01:09:05.118 line:93%
(It's Haha's.)

01:09:05.158 --> 01:09:06.717 line:93%
It's his.

01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:10.958 line:93%
(There are so many twists in this race.)

01:09:11.927 --> 01:09:13.458 line:93%
We have two cards.

01:09:13.698 --> 01:09:15.127 line:93%
We had two.

01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:17.097 line:93%
We won.

01:09:17.097 --> 01:09:18.767 line:93%
That was totally unexpected.

01:09:19.137 --> 01:09:20.198 line:93%
(As a twist, Haha loses.)

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:23.438 line:93%
The first game is over. Haha got chosen, so he loses.

01:09:23.438 --> 01:09:26.408 line:93%
(The first game is over.)

01:09:29.347 --> 01:09:31.248 line:93%
What do we do? We are here for Jang Hyuk.

01:09:31.248 --> 01:09:33.148 line:93%
- My gosh. - I feel bad.

01:09:33.148 --> 01:09:34.887 line:93%
- Right? - This game...

01:09:34.887 --> 01:09:36.488 line:93%
- He's so charismatic. - Right?

01:09:36.488 --> 01:09:38.288 line:93%
You can't make him play that game.

01:09:38.288 --> 01:09:39.387 line:93%
What plastic bottle?

01:09:39.387 --> 01:09:41.387 line:93%
- Aren't there other games? - They're friends of 20 years.

01:09:41.387 --> 01:09:43.057 line:93%
There are other games too.

01:09:43.057 --> 01:09:45.498 line:93%
They have a friendship to preserve.

01:09:45.498 --> 01:09:46.557 line:93%
- You know the rules, right? - Yes.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.797 line:93%
If you don't put the sticker on him, you two are a team.

01:09:48.797 --> 01:09:50.297 line:93%
Let's be on the same team.

01:09:51.698 --> 01:09:52.868 line:93%
From now on,

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:55.137 line:93%
- you have to decide in 5 minutes. - 5 minutes?

01:09:55.137 --> 01:09:57.108 line:93%
- Okay. - Time's up once I blow the whistle.

01:09:57.108 --> 01:10:00.137 line:93%
He's in the middle of a drama, and he has a charismatic role.

01:10:00.137 --> 01:10:01.238 line:93%
He's so charismatic.

01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:02.408 line:93%
Hyuk.

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:04.007 line:93%
(It's Hyuk.)

01:10:04.108 --> 01:10:05.717 line:93%
- He's so charismatic. - Hyuk.

01:10:05.717 --> 01:10:08.618 line:93%
(It's the charismatic actor, Jang Hyuk.)

01:10:08.618 --> 01:10:10.717 line:93%
You sounded worried.

01:10:10.717 --> 01:10:12.618 line:93%
I overheard you...

01:10:12.618 --> 01:10:14.788 line:93%
- on the phone. - You were worried.

01:10:14.788 --> 01:10:17.557 line:93%
You were worried about being on our show because of your current role.

01:10:17.557 --> 01:10:21.198 line:93%
When I come on shows that involve my friends,

01:10:21.198 --> 01:10:23.898 line:93%
I know I have to embarrass myself.

01:10:24.698 --> 01:10:26.938 line:93%
So... I'm...

01:10:27.038 --> 01:10:29.738 line:93%
I'm just going to go with it.

01:10:29.738 --> 01:10:32.408 line:93%
He's not like this. He'll never do this on other shows.

01:10:32.408 --> 01:10:35.648 line:93%
- I know. - He has standards of his own.

01:10:35.877 --> 01:10:37.248 line:93%
When he sees us...

01:10:37.248 --> 01:10:40.578 line:93%
When I see Cha Tae Hyun, Kim Jong Kook, and Hong Kyung In,

01:10:40.578 --> 01:10:42.547 line:93%
I give it all.

01:10:42.547 --> 01:10:45.458 line:93%
Right. Thank you so much. We came here,

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:47.358 line:93%
- but we're bothering you. - I feel bad.

01:10:47.358 --> 01:10:50.727 line:93%
- He's doing so well. - That's right.

01:10:50.858 --> 01:10:52.797 line:93%
- You're in the middle of a drama. - Right.

01:10:52.858 --> 01:10:54.127 line:93%
You need to take a break. We are sorry.

01:10:54.127 --> 01:10:55.667 line:93%
- Sorry. - It's all right.

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:57.868 line:93%
It's cold, so let's hurry.

01:10:57.868 --> 01:10:59.297 line:93%
- Yes. - All right.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:00.538 line:93%
- It's over? - It's been five minutes.

01:11:00.538 --> 01:11:01.608 line:93%
- It's over? - Time's up?

01:11:01.608 --> 01:11:03.167 line:93%
We were asking how he was doing.

01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:04.778 line:93%
That doesn't count.

01:11:04.807 --> 01:11:06.108 line:93%
It's too bad,

01:11:06.438 --> 01:11:08.208 line:93%
but Hyuk is on his own.

01:11:09.847 --> 01:11:11.818 line:93%
Seok Jin and Jong Kook are on the same team.

01:11:11.818 --> 01:11:12.877 line:93%
No way.

01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:14.177 line:93%
What do we have to do?

01:11:14.177 --> 01:11:15.618 line:93%
- Goodness. - Let me explain.

01:11:15.618 --> 01:11:17.517 line:93%
It's a game. It's 2 versus 1.

01:11:18.087 --> 01:11:21.958 line:93%
Here's the game you'll be playing.

01:11:23.858 --> 01:11:24.998 line:93%
- It's simple. - We will explain.

01:11:24.998 --> 01:11:27.028 line:93%
We asked for a different game.

01:11:28.498 --> 01:11:30.998 line:93%
(I have to play that game?)

01:11:30.998 --> 01:11:32.698 line:93%
We asked.

01:11:32.698 --> 01:11:33.967 line:93%
We asked for another game.

01:11:34.767 --> 01:11:36.807 line:93%
- We asked. - We tried...

01:11:36.807 --> 01:11:38.078 line:93%
to change it.

01:11:38.078 --> 01:11:40.208 line:93%
- We asked. - They said they didn't have any.

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:42.448 line:93%
- We asked. We're so sorry. - We didn't want to do it.

01:11:42.448 --> 01:11:44.648 line:93%
I felt so bad. You're my friend.

01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:48.318 line:93%
This game is called Snort of 12.

01:11:48.948 --> 01:11:51.887 line:93%
I have to blow this with my nose?

01:11:52.587 --> 01:11:53.818 line:93%
I told you. We tried.

01:11:53.887 --> 01:11:55.528 line:93%
We asked for a different game.

01:11:55.887 --> 01:11:58.257 line:93%
- We tried for an hour. - We asked for another one.

01:11:58.257 --> 01:12:00.627 line:93%
- We asked for a different one. - We tried many times.

01:12:00.627 --> 01:12:03.068 line:93%
- We did. Sorry. - We asked for another one.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:06.738 line:93%
Why don't you just recruit me? I'll just be a regular.

01:12:07.167 --> 01:12:09.967 line:93%
- I'll be a regular. - Please.

01:12:09.967 --> 01:12:11.238 line:93%
We need a contract.

01:12:11.408 --> 01:12:12.708 line:93%
The rules are simple.

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:16.078 line:93%
Breathe into the plastic bottles with your nose,

01:12:16.278 --> 01:12:19.177 line:93%
and the team that unflattens the bottles first wins.

01:12:19.177 --> 01:12:20.278 line:93%
(1, 2, 3, 4)

01:12:20.278 --> 01:12:21.818 line:93%
He's counting.

01:12:22.148 --> 01:12:23.488 line:93%
(He did.)

01:12:24.887 --> 01:12:26.087 line:93%
Don't you need to blow your nose?

01:12:26.257 --> 01:12:27.858 line:93%
I do.

01:12:27.858 --> 01:12:29.858 line:93%
Just in case. Thank you.

01:12:30.257 --> 01:12:32.127 line:93%
Let's get clean first.

01:12:32.498 --> 01:12:35.198 line:93%
It's like getting rid of last year's germs.

01:12:35.198 --> 01:12:37.127 line:93%
I'm so sorry, Hyuk. We won't take long.

01:12:38.198 --> 01:12:39.368 line:93%
I'm sorry,

01:12:39.368 --> 01:12:40.967 line:93%
- Top Excellence Award winner. - You two were the winners.

01:12:40.998 --> 01:12:43.708 line:93%
We're both Top Excellence Award winners. I'm sorry.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:45.877 line:93%
Let me repeat. We tried to negotiate for an hour.

01:12:45.877 --> 01:12:48.908 line:93%
- Let's unflatten this a little. - Jong Kook said...

01:12:48.908 --> 01:12:50.608 line:93%
his friend has a charismatic role.

01:12:50.608 --> 01:12:53.618 line:93%
Let's help him a little. They're too tight.

01:12:53.618 --> 01:12:55.417 line:93%
No, no.

01:12:56.248 --> 01:12:59.158 line:93%
- We have to do this properly. - It has to be fair?

01:12:59.288 --> 01:13:01.887 line:93%
- Let's crush ours. - Okay.

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:04.127 line:93%
- This... - Let's do that.

01:13:04.127 --> 01:13:05.998 line:93%
- Let's crush them a lot. - Okay.

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:08.667 line:93%
(He doesn't try.)

01:13:08.767 --> 01:13:09.868 line:93%
Let's crush them.

01:13:09.868 --> 01:13:13.267 line:93%
You're pretending like you're crushing them.

01:13:13.637 --> 01:13:15.467 line:93%
- I'll do it. - I thought...

01:13:15.467 --> 01:13:17.068 line:93%
- he was crushing them. - No.

01:13:17.068 --> 01:13:18.778 line:93%
- You're faking it. - I did it.

01:13:18.778 --> 01:13:20.208 line:93%
I really did it.

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:22.477 line:93%
Ours are so crushed.

01:13:22.807 --> 01:13:24.148 line:93%
- Get ready. - Let's do this.

01:13:24.148 --> 01:13:26.078 line:93%
(Hyuk has to beat the other two with his nose muscles.)

01:13:26.078 --> 01:13:28.248 line:93%
Do this. It doesn't take long.

01:13:28.587 --> 01:13:29.748 line:93%
Ready.

01:13:31.148 --> 01:13:32.288 line:93%
Set...

01:13:32.288 --> 01:13:36.328 line:93%
(Will Hyuk give it his best and win the mission?)

01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:39.727 line:93%
(He unflattens it in one try.)

01:13:40.557 --> 01:13:43.167 line:93%
(He sweeps it with his large lung capacity.)

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:44.568 line:93%
(Meanwhile...)

01:13:45.698 --> 01:13:48.208 line:93%
(He's barely doing anything.)

01:13:48.538 --> 01:13:50.967 line:93%
This is not working. How is he doing this?

01:13:50.967 --> 01:13:52.307 line:93%
Hurry up!

01:13:53.608 --> 01:13:54.807 line:93%
How do you do this?

01:13:54.807 --> 01:13:59.477 line:93%
(Hyuk is faster than the other two.)

01:14:00.977 --> 01:14:02.248 line:93%
(They're doing two at a time and are catching up.)

01:14:02.248 --> 01:14:03.517 line:93%
This is not working.

01:14:04.017 --> 01:14:05.288 line:93%
(He runs out of energy.)

01:14:05.288 --> 01:14:06.358 line:93%
Next.

01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:09.488 line:93%
How many did he do? My snot is coming out.

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:11.498 line:93%
(This match is unpredictable.)

01:14:15.097 --> 01:14:16.297 line:93%
(It's over.)

01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:17.568 line:93%
My gosh.

01:14:18.297 --> 01:14:19.297 line:93%
(Giggling)

01:14:19.297 --> 01:14:20.438 line:93%
My gosh.

01:14:20.967 --> 01:14:22.208 line:93%
- Good job. - Was I funny?

01:14:22.908 --> 01:14:24.038 line:93%
- Was that fun? - Hyuk.

01:14:24.807 --> 01:14:26.177 line:93%
(He cares more about being funny than his appearance.)

01:14:26.177 --> 01:14:27.208 line:93%
I'm sorry.

01:14:28.078 --> 01:14:29.078 line:93%
I'm so sorry.

01:14:29.078 --> 01:14:30.377 line:93%
It's totally okay.

01:14:30.377 --> 01:14:31.748 line:93%
That was so funny.

01:14:31.748 --> 01:14:33.318 line:93%
You tried your best.

01:14:33.318 --> 01:14:35.547 line:93%
Thanks so much.

01:14:36.288 --> 01:14:38.717 line:93%
There's one of Hyuk's that's not unflatten properly,

01:14:41.158 --> 01:14:42.788 line:93%
so Seok Jin and Jong Kook win.

01:14:42.788 --> 01:14:44.557 line:93%
(They win 20 ddakjis.)

01:14:44.557 --> 01:14:45.627 line:93%
Sorry.

01:14:45.627 --> 01:14:47.597 line:93%
- He tried his best. - He did.

01:14:47.597 --> 01:14:49.427 line:93%
- Did you see his face? - Excuse me.

01:14:49.967 --> 01:14:51.167 line:93%
I couldn't do it because I was laughing.

01:14:51.167 --> 01:14:53.097 line:93%
If it's really bad, please blur it out.

01:14:54.438 --> 01:14:56.438 line:93%
- They'll do a good job. - I'm acting as a lawyer.

01:14:56.637 --> 01:14:58.677 line:93%
It'll be fine.

01:14:58.677 --> 01:15:03.177 line:93%
On my sixth bottle, I turned a bit pale.

01:15:03.177 --> 01:15:04.507 line:93%
(He cares more about winning than the friendship.)

01:15:04.507 --> 01:15:07.278 line:93%
- So I switched nostrils. - You turned pale?

01:15:07.578 --> 01:15:09.188 line:93%
- You switched nostrils? - I was doing this side,

01:15:09.188 --> 01:15:11.318 line:93%
and I couldn't keep it up, so I switched.

01:15:13.057 --> 01:15:16.227 line:93%
(He got dizzy,)

01:15:16.227 --> 01:15:18.358 line:93%
(so he switched to the other nostril.)

01:15:18.358 --> 01:15:20.658 line:93%
There's a request from the Running Man fans.

01:15:20.658 --> 01:15:22.927 line:93%
Lee Sang Yeob did an impression of you.

01:15:23.028 --> 01:15:25.368 line:93%
He got popular for saying, "Un Nyun".

01:15:26.738 --> 01:15:28.307 line:93%
"Un Nyun!"

01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:33.307 line:93%
(The fans wanted to see the original version.)

01:15:33.307 --> 01:15:35.047 line:93%
Can we see the original?

01:15:35.047 --> 01:15:36.278 line:93%
- Did you see it? - Did you?

01:15:36.278 --> 01:15:38.618 line:93%
- Did you see it on Running Man? - That line...

01:15:38.877 --> 01:15:40.748 line:93%
- is not supposed to be like that. - Then?

01:15:40.748 --> 01:15:42.017 line:93%
What is it?

01:15:42.148 --> 01:15:43.788 line:93%
He did it really weirdly.

01:15:43.788 --> 01:15:46.618 line:93%
- Really? - It looked weird.

01:15:46.618 --> 01:15:48.358 line:93%
Show us the original.

01:15:48.358 --> 01:15:50.557 line:93%
(How does the original do it?)

01:15:50.557 --> 01:15:54.127 line:93%
"Un Nyun". Like this.

01:15:54.528 --> 01:15:55.927 line:93%
- Was that it? - Yes.

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:57.127 line:93%
- Is this the original? - Yes.

01:15:57.127 --> 01:15:58.198 line:93%
It's the same.

01:15:58.297 --> 01:15:59.938 line:93%
(These two...)

01:15:59.938 --> 01:16:02.837 line:93%
(are not that different.)

01:16:02.837 --> 01:16:04.068 line:93%
(It's the same.)

01:16:04.068 --> 01:16:05.078 line:93%
"Un Nyun".

01:16:05.078 --> 01:16:07.208 line:93%
Maybe I speak and hear differently.

01:16:07.677 --> 01:16:08.977 line:93%
Perhaps.

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:12.148 line:93%
We're finally here.

01:16:12.148 --> 01:16:13.778 line:93%
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan are by Sangam SBS Prism Tower.)

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:15.148 line:93%
- She's here. - Is that her?

01:16:15.288 --> 01:16:16.448 line:93%
The lights are on.

01:16:16.448 --> 01:16:18.017 line:93%
(They're waiting for their guest.)

01:16:18.118 --> 01:16:21.217 line:93%
(Only top stars drive this car.)

01:16:21.217 --> 01:16:26.057 line:93%
(Who's inside the car?)

01:16:26.398 --> 01:16:27.627 line:93%
- Na Rae. - Oh, dear.

01:16:27.627 --> 01:16:30.828 line:93%
(It's Park Na Rae, the star of entertainment awards.)

01:16:30.828 --> 01:16:32.198 line:93%
- Na Rae. - Oh, dear.

01:16:32.198 --> 01:16:34.068 line:93%
Na Rae.

01:16:34.068 --> 01:16:35.238 line:93%
- Na Rae. - Na Rae.

01:16:35.238 --> 01:16:36.837 line:93%
- What's going on? - Na Rae.

01:16:36.837 --> 01:16:38.307 line:93%
(What happened among them?)

01:16:39.238 --> 01:16:41.648 line:93%
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:16:42.078 --> 01:16:46.047 line:93%
We're in trouble. This is going nowhere.

01:16:46.547 --> 01:16:47.648 line:93%
(They stopped at a bus station.)

01:16:47.648 --> 01:16:49.887 line:93%
- It's here. - Let's go there.

01:16:50.288 --> 01:16:52.618 line:93%
(Sangam was 12 stations away.)

01:16:52.887 --> 01:16:54.788 line:93%
- Let's go. - Go.

01:16:56.488 --> 01:16:59.627 line:93%
("Comedy Big League" was being filmed today.)

01:17:00.328 --> 01:17:01.998 line:93%
- Let's go there. - They're in Sangam.

01:17:02.498 --> 01:17:03.498 line:93%
Hold on.

01:17:03.498 --> 01:17:05.368 line:93%
(He's called Na Rae.)

01:17:05.368 --> 01:17:06.498 line:93%
- Hello? - Na Rae.

01:17:06.868 --> 01:17:08.307 line:93%
- Yes? - Where are you?

01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:09.807 line:93%
I'm on my way.

01:17:09.807 --> 01:17:12.438 line:93%
- During our team dinner, - Yes.

01:17:12.438 --> 01:17:15.748 line:93%
you made a big mess, so we have to talk.

01:17:15.748 --> 01:17:18.948 line:93%
I'll be in the parking lot we always park in.

01:17:19.148 --> 01:17:20.477 line:93%
See you later.

01:17:21.948 --> 01:17:23.017 line:93%
Really?

01:17:23.017 --> 01:17:24.818 line:93%
Have some tangerines.

01:17:24.818 --> 01:17:26.318 line:93%
Na Rae.

01:17:26.587 --> 01:17:28.087 line:93%
Are you sober now?

01:17:28.528 --> 01:17:29.988 line:93%
Are you okay?

01:17:30.127 --> 01:17:31.727 line:93%
I'm going to court. What's going on?

01:17:31.727 --> 01:17:33.158 line:93%
Let's talk about that later.

01:17:33.597 --> 01:17:34.727 line:93%
Put on a microphone.

01:17:34.727 --> 01:17:35.828 line:93%
What's going on?

01:17:36.097 --> 01:17:37.927 line:93%
Why am I putting this on? I have to go in.

01:17:37.927 --> 01:17:39.438 line:93%
- I need my jacket. - Give us 10 minutes.

01:17:39.767 --> 01:17:41.408 line:93%
- 10 minutes? - It'll only take 10 minutes.

01:17:41.568 --> 01:17:44.538 line:93%
You need to dress like a celebrity.

01:17:45.477 --> 01:17:46.538 line:93%
Here it is.

01:17:46.538 --> 01:17:48.807 line:93%
You didn't disappoint us with that color.

01:17:49.108 --> 01:17:52.347 line:93%
Why are we all wearing only primary colors?

01:17:52.748 --> 01:17:55.618 line:93%
- This is tangerine. - Tangerine? I see.

01:17:56.448 --> 01:17:58.288 line:93%
- We're doing a mission. - Okay.

01:17:58.288 --> 01:18:03.028 line:93%
Can you spare 10 minutes for us? Let's go to SBS.

01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:04.427 line:93%
What mission is this?

01:18:04.427 --> 01:18:06.297 line:93%
- It's so simple. - Really?

01:18:06.297 --> 01:18:08.627 line:93%
I don't think you are sober yet.

01:18:08.627 --> 01:18:09.927 line:93%
I don't think you are.

01:18:09.927 --> 01:18:11.738 line:93%
- That night was intense. - Na Rae.

01:18:12.467 --> 01:18:14.368 line:93%
- This is really simple. - It's simple.

01:18:15.068 --> 01:18:18.208 line:93%
(Are there stones on a dish with a cup on the bottom?)

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:20.637 line:93%
- Explain. - We hold this...

01:18:20.637 --> 01:18:24.578 line:93%
and throw it up. If all five stones go in the cup, you win.

01:18:24.578 --> 01:18:26.347 line:93%
- It's over once you do it 1st. - You have 5 chances.

01:18:26.448 --> 01:18:27.578 line:93%
But you're on your own.

01:18:29.717 --> 01:18:30.948 line:93%
- What? - You're by yourself.

01:18:30.948 --> 01:18:32.057 line:93%
You're on your own.

01:18:32.158 --> 01:18:33.417 line:93%
But there's a condition.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.227 line:93%
If you get five in the cup first,

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.557 line:93%
you win a big prize.

01:18:38.658 --> 01:18:39.658 line:93%
- Really? - Yes.

01:18:39.958 --> 01:18:41.927 line:93%
This is not just for fun.

01:18:42.127 --> 01:18:43.427 line:93%
We have to do this.

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.267 line:93%
- We have to win. - We have to get this.

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:47.398 line:93%
Our lives depend on this, Se Chan.

01:18:47.398 --> 01:18:49.368 line:93%
- This better be worth our time. - I know.

01:18:49.467 --> 01:18:50.507 line:93%
Ready.

01:18:50.507 --> 01:18:54.108 line:93%
(This is their first step toward winning.)

01:18:54.108 --> 01:18:55.208 line:93%
Set...

01:18:56.377 --> 01:18:58.477 line:93%
(Flipping)

01:18:58.477 --> 01:18:59.578 line:93%
Okay.

01:18:59.578 --> 01:19:01.177 line:93%
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan get 2 at a time.)

01:19:02.887 --> 01:19:04.118 line:93%
- Okay. - Hold on.

01:19:04.118 --> 01:19:05.488 line:93%
- We only have one left. - Ji Hyo.

01:19:05.488 --> 01:19:06.688 line:93%
Take a breath.

01:19:07.188 --> 01:19:09.858 line:93%
(Meanwhile for Na Rae...)

01:19:09.858 --> 01:19:11.528 line:93%
My gosh. Why is this not working?

01:19:13.227 --> 01:19:14.297 line:93%
(Sighing)

01:19:14.297 --> 01:19:17.097 line:93%
Ji Hyo, take a breath.

01:19:17.198 --> 01:19:18.538 line:93%
We're almost done.

01:19:18.538 --> 01:19:19.837 line:93%
Oh, dear. Na Rae.

01:19:19.938 --> 01:19:22.068 line:93%
- You still have shaky hands. - Wait.

01:19:22.908 --> 01:19:25.507 line:93%
(She has unexplained shaky hands.)

01:19:25.507 --> 01:19:26.578 line:93%
You have a tremor,

01:19:26.578 --> 01:19:29.307 line:93%
- so you can't do it. - Move over.

01:19:29.908 --> 01:19:30.948 line:93%
(Flying)

01:19:33.017 --> 01:19:35.688 line:93%
- Stop drinking. - Goodness.

01:19:35.818 --> 01:19:37.847 line:93%
Running Man is rated 12A.

01:19:37.847 --> 01:19:41.427 line:93%
- She's so funny. - Na Rae, we're done.

01:19:41.427 --> 01:19:42.658 line:93%
- You are? - We have one left.

01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:44.028 line:93%
We have one left.

01:19:44.828 --> 01:19:46.097 line:93%
- Okay. - There you go.

01:19:46.458 --> 01:19:47.727 line:93%
All right. Get ready, Ji Hyo.

01:19:48.797 --> 01:19:50.797 line:93%
- Okay. - Go, Ji Hyo.

01:19:50.998 --> 01:19:53.238 line:93%
- My goodness. - Ji Hyo, hurry up.

01:19:53.238 --> 01:19:54.708 line:93%
Ji Hyo, Na Rae got the hang of it.

01:19:54.837 --> 01:19:56.507 line:93%
Na Rae got the hang of it.

01:19:56.507 --> 01:19:58.007 line:93%
Na Rae got the hang of it. You need to hurry up.

01:19:58.137 --> 01:19:59.637 line:93%
- Okay. - Hurry up.

01:20:00.477 --> 01:20:01.477 line:93%
Okay!

01:20:01.477 --> 01:20:03.748 line:93%
(She comes from behind and wins.)

01:20:04.448 --> 01:20:08.488 line:93%
(This must be how the hare looked after losing to the tortoise.)

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:12.717 line:93%
You should have picked up the stones for me.

01:20:13.057 --> 01:20:15.227 line:93%
Woman-who-is-pushing-40, what are you doing?

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:18.257 line:93%
I ran around the room because of you.

01:20:18.458 --> 01:20:20.858 line:93%
You should have picked up the stones for me.

01:20:22.727 --> 01:20:25.038 line:93%
Hold on. How did you do so well toward the end?

01:20:25.038 --> 01:20:27.767 line:93%
My hands began to shake in a rhythmical way.

01:20:27.767 --> 01:20:30.108 line:93%
(My hands began to shake in a rhythmical way.)

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:34.507 line:93%
(Rhythmical)

01:20:36.078 --> 01:20:38.818 line:93%
Na Rae got the hang of it. This is a disaster.

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:41.248 line:93%
Okay. We will give Na Rae a gift.

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:45.087 line:93%
Na Rae, your appearance on Running Man...

01:20:45.158 --> 01:20:48.927 line:93%
earned you a gift.

01:20:50.658 --> 01:20:52.127 line:93%
- Thank you for your hard work. - Hold on.

01:20:52.127 --> 01:20:55.427 line:93%
- Running Man gives you tangerines. - Hold on.

01:20:55.427 --> 01:20:57.698 line:93%
- It matches your outfit. - They match.

01:20:58.137 --> 01:21:01.137 line:93%
Please take these tangerines. I hope you have a good shoot today.

01:21:01.137 --> 01:21:03.568 line:93%
Hold on. These tangerines look familiar.

01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:05.637 line:93%
How did they come back to me?

01:21:05.738 --> 01:21:07.738 line:93%
You know,

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:09.778 line:93%
- life is a circle. - That's right.

01:21:09.778 --> 01:21:11.318 line:93%
- Bye. Thank you. - Good luck.

01:21:11.318 --> 01:21:12.847 line:93%
- All right. - Bye.

01:21:12.847 --> 01:21:14.248 line:93%
Good luck. Happy New Year!

01:21:14.248 --> 01:21:15.587 line:93%
Happy New Year!

01:21:15.587 --> 01:21:17.248 line:93%
(Thank you for coming despite your busy schedule, Na Rae.)

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.658 line:93%
The one with the Rookie Award.

01:21:19.658 --> 01:21:21.427 line:93%
- All right. - It's hot.

01:21:21.427 --> 01:21:22.528 line:93%
(So Min's score is 85.)

01:21:22.528 --> 01:21:23.927 line:93%
I will go next.

01:21:24.828 --> 01:21:26.427 line:93%
Which song will you sing?

01:21:26.427 --> 01:21:27.427 line:93%
I will sing "Darling".

01:21:28.127 --> 01:21:29.127 line:93%
He lives young, right?

01:21:29.127 --> 01:21:31.097 line:93%
I was going to sing "Flower" by Jang Yun Jung.

01:21:31.198 --> 01:21:33.167 line:93%
- That's a good idea. - Let's stick to trot.

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:38.438 line:93%
(I must win.)

01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:43.007 line:93%
(A backup dancer interferes.)

01:21:44.007 --> 01:21:45.677 line:93%
(Stepping)

01:21:46.118 --> 01:21:48.948 line:93%
(He tries his best to concentrate.)

01:21:53.017 --> 01:21:54.517 line:93%
(She grabs the attention.)

01:21:56.528 --> 01:21:58.557 line:93%
(He is annoyed.)

01:21:58.557 --> 01:22:01.998 line:93%
(So Min's dance makes Jae Seok impatient.)

01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:03.667 line:93%
What is going on?

01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:05.667 line:93%
(He takes off his clothes one by one.)

01:22:07.238 --> 01:22:08.637 line:93%
(Darling)

01:22:08.637 --> 01:22:10.007 line:93%
(You)

01:22:10.307 --> 01:22:12.578 line:93%
(Jae Seok's performance gets edited to meet TV guidelines.)

01:22:13.738 --> 01:22:14.748 line:93%
(Jae Seok's "Darling" receives a score of 83.)

01:22:14.748 --> 01:22:15.977 line:93%
- Thank goodness. - We did it.

01:22:16.408 --> 01:22:18.318 line:93%
Jae Seok, why are you so bad at singing?

01:22:18.318 --> 01:22:20.318 line:93%
How are we two points apart when he sang so terribly?

01:22:20.377 --> 01:22:23.047 line:93%
So Min, the key wasn't high.

01:22:23.047 --> 01:22:24.688 line:93%
- He just can't sing. - Don't be ridiculous.

01:22:24.688 --> 01:22:27.118 line:93%
(It's So Min's fault.)

01:22:28.158 --> 01:22:29.988 line:93%
If you score 82, it's a tie. If you score 81, you lose.

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:31.597 line:93%
Young Chul, help me.

01:22:31.597 --> 01:22:34.057 line:93%
Don't worry. It will be game over once I sing this song.

01:22:34.398 --> 01:22:35.398 line:93%
Young Chul.

01:22:35.568 --> 01:22:37.498 line:93%
- "Flower" by Jang Yun Jung. - All right.

01:22:37.498 --> 01:22:39.368 line:93%
- That's good. - Don't lower the key.

01:22:39.368 --> 01:22:40.837 line:93%
The current key is for women.

01:22:40.837 --> 01:22:42.767 line:93%
The key was high for Taeyang's song, too.

01:22:42.767 --> 01:22:43.767 line:93%
The current key is for women.

01:22:43.767 --> 01:22:45.208 line:93%
(His score needs to be 81 or less for Jae Seok to win.)

01:22:45.837 --> 01:22:47.637 line:93%
I lowered the key since it was for women.

01:22:48.477 --> 01:22:50.778 line:93%
(I have to do something.)

01:22:51.618 --> 01:22:52.618 line:93%
(Grabbing)

01:22:54.248 --> 01:22:56.788 line:93%
(He blocks the microphone...)

01:22:56.788 --> 01:22:58.788 line:93%
(and tickles Young Chul.)

01:22:59.318 --> 01:23:01.858 line:93%
(He attacks like an immature child.)

01:23:01.858 --> 01:23:02.927 line:93%
What are you doing?

01:23:03.627 --> 01:23:04.627 line:93%
Move.

01:23:06.358 --> 01:23:08.767 line:93%
(Don't pester Young Chul.)

01:23:09.467 --> 01:23:10.998 line:93%
(Following)

01:23:15.568 --> 01:23:18.208 line:93%
(Young Chul, focus on singing.)

01:23:19.108 --> 01:23:21.108 line:93%
(What are you doing?)

01:23:22.377 --> 01:23:24.047 line:93%
(She attacks viciously.)

01:23:24.847 --> 01:23:28.788 line:93%
(A match that began with betrayal becomes a fistfight.)

01:23:28.948 --> 01:23:29.948 line:93%
(Grabbing)

01:23:31.387 --> 01:23:32.887 line:93%
(Pulling)

01:23:33.288 --> 01:23:36.257 line:93%
(As the fight becomes more fierce,)

01:23:36.257 --> 01:23:39.858 line:93%
(the singing contest loses its original meaning.)

01:23:40.727 --> 01:23:43.467 line:93%
(She anesthetizes him.)

01:23:44.498 --> 01:23:47.198 line:93%
(As Jae Seok gets anesthetized,)

01:23:47.198 --> 01:23:50.137 line:93%
(Young Chul's steps turn sadder.)

01:23:50.137 --> 01:23:52.278 line:93%
For goodness' sake. Come here.

01:23:52.408 --> 01:23:55.278 line:93%
They will take all of my screen time.

01:23:55.347 --> 01:23:56.507 line:93%
Let go.

01:23:56.507 --> 01:23:58.648 line:93%
(Both the singer and the listeners are in tatters.)

01:24:00.448 --> 01:24:02.417 line:93%
(Young Chul's song is over.)

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:03.887 line:93%
Let's see it.

01:24:03.887 --> 01:24:06.057 line:93%
(It's time to check the score.)

01:24:06.057 --> 01:24:09.057 line:93%
(If the score is 81 or less, Jae Seok wins.)

01:24:09.057 --> 01:24:11.757 line:93%

01:24:11.757 --> 01:24:13.427 line:93%
The score, please.

01:24:14.057 --> 01:24:16.127 line:93%

01:24:17.498 --> 01:24:19.938 line:93%
(Young Chul is the king of karaoke machines.)

01:24:19.938 --> 01:24:23.108 line:93%
I am a singer.

01:24:23.307 --> 01:24:25.637 line:93%
"Are you the king of singers?" I am a singer.

01:24:26.208 --> 01:24:27.438 line:93%
Good job, Young Chul.

01:24:27.778 --> 01:24:30.748 line:93%
(So Min debuts successfully as a singer.)

01:24:32.278 --> 01:24:34.517 line:93%
So Min will receive 20 ddakjis.

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:37.248 line:93%
(Meanwhile, Haha and Kwang Soo...)

01:24:37.248 --> 01:24:38.458 line:93%
It's coming.

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:41.557 line:93%
- Thank you for the dessert. - Thank you.

01:24:41.557 --> 01:24:44.528 line:93%
Their dessert is popular.

01:24:45.427 --> 01:24:47.358 line:93%
- Thank you. - My goodness.

01:24:47.358 --> 01:24:49.467 line:93%

01:24:51.637 --> 01:24:53.238 line:93%
- I really missed you. - I missed you.

01:24:53.238 --> 01:24:54.297 line:93%
Thank you.

01:24:55.238 --> 01:24:56.538 line:93%
(They enjoy a coffee break with Sang Yeob.)

01:24:56.538 --> 01:24:59.337 line:93%
Even the ice looks splendid.

01:24:59.337 --> 01:25:00.377 line:93%
I know.

01:25:00.608 --> 01:25:02.007 line:93%
What did you do yesterday?

01:25:03.108 --> 01:25:04.948 line:93%
I went home after the awards ceremony.

01:25:05.448 --> 01:25:06.547 line:93%
You were really happy, right?

01:25:06.948 --> 01:25:09.087 line:93%
- Congratulations. - Seriously.

01:25:09.118 --> 01:25:11.288 line:93%
I was so happy...

01:25:11.618 --> 01:25:13.017 line:93%
that I drank a lot.

01:25:13.057 --> 01:25:14.358 line:93%
You drank.

01:25:14.358 --> 01:25:15.358 line:93%
The occasion called for it.

01:25:15.488 --> 01:25:18.097 line:93%
When you called me,

01:25:18.227 --> 01:25:20.297 line:93%
- I was getting scolded by my mom. - Really?

01:25:20.297 --> 01:25:21.568 line:93%
That's why I picked up right away. "Hello?"

01:25:22.297 --> 01:25:23.727 line:93%
That's why you picked up.

01:25:23.727 --> 01:25:25.967 line:93%
He answered a call from an unknown number.

01:25:26.097 --> 01:25:28.608 line:93%
I would have even answered a spam call about loans...

01:25:28.608 --> 01:25:29.637 line:93%
at that moment.

01:25:30.007 --> 01:25:32.578 line:93%
Had a loan shark called me, I would have gone, "Hello?"

01:25:34.377 --> 01:25:35.578 line:93%
That's hilarious.

01:25:35.578 --> 01:25:36.648 line:93%
He is good.

01:25:37.748 --> 01:25:40.448 line:93%
I love Sang Yeob. I love him.

01:25:40.477 --> 01:25:42.217 line:93%
That goes without saying.

01:25:42.818 --> 01:25:44.448 line:93%
You seem busy these days.

01:25:44.448 --> 01:25:46.358 line:93%
(He suddenly talks to Kwang Soo.)

01:25:46.858 --> 01:25:48.057 line:93%
- Me? - Never mind.

01:25:48.257 --> 01:25:49.788 line:93%
Sang Yeob...

01:25:49.988 --> 01:25:51.858 line:93%
Sang Yeob is so refreshing.

01:25:51.858 --> 01:25:54.227 line:93%
He is like lemon tart. He is so refreshing.

01:25:55.898 --> 01:25:57.198 line:93%
Something is different...

01:25:57.198 --> 01:25:58.297 line:93%
- about him. - You hurt my feelings.

01:25:59.137 --> 01:26:00.938 line:93%
Why did you clench your fist?

01:26:01.238 --> 01:26:03.438 line:93%
- He is really different. - My feelings are hurt.

01:26:03.438 --> 01:26:06.007 line:93%
(A star with blood type B, a star who is wanted as a member)

01:26:06.007 --> 01:26:09.007 line:93%
I will give you the mission now as you may be required to wait.

01:26:09.608 --> 01:26:10.948 line:93%
This is the second mission.

01:26:10.948 --> 01:26:13.347 line:93%
If Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob win, the game ends.

01:26:13.347 --> 01:26:14.448 line:93%
- It's game over, right? - Yes.

01:26:14.448 --> 01:26:15.547 line:93%
(If Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob win, the game ends.)

01:26:15.748 --> 01:26:16.748 line:93%
This is your second choice.

01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:18.757 line:93%
Once the mission begins,

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:20.057 line:93%
(Choice of 12, Round 2)

01:26:20.057 --> 01:26:22.427 line:93%
you win if the customer who walks into the cafe...

01:26:22.688 --> 01:26:24.627 line:93%
orders the menu you chose.

01:26:24.828 --> 01:26:26.927 line:93%
Please pick a menu before the mission begins.

01:26:27.898 --> 01:26:29.667 line:93%
(You win the mission...)

01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:33.398 line:93%
(by correctly guessing the menu the first customer will order.)

01:26:33.398 --> 01:26:34.837 line:93%
(If either Sang Yeob or Kwang Soo gets it right,)

01:26:34.837 --> 01:26:36.307 line:93%
(Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo win.)

01:26:36.307 --> 01:26:38.007 line:93%
- We should choose differently. - We have an advantage.

01:26:38.007 --> 01:26:39.578 line:93%
- We do. - We have an advantage.

01:26:39.708 --> 01:26:41.177 line:93%
I made up my mind.

01:26:41.748 --> 01:26:44.977 line:93%
Since there are a lot of female customers,

01:26:45.347 --> 01:26:47.448 line:93%
I will choose hot latte.

01:26:49.217 --> 01:26:51.118 line:93%
Since it's cold, I will choose hot chocolate.

01:26:51.557 --> 01:26:52.858 line:93%
Women like hot chocolate.

01:26:52.858 --> 01:26:54.727 line:93%
You can't change your choice after you say it.

01:26:55.658 --> 01:26:57.927 line:93%
Then I will also choose hot latte.

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:01.127 line:93%
Why don't the two of you play Dreadful Pirate?

01:27:02.227 --> 01:27:04.198 line:93%
You want to ruin my chance.

01:27:05.767 --> 01:27:07.597 line:93%
- I will choose a different one. - Which one?

01:27:08.467 --> 01:27:11.778 line:93%
I will choose hot Americano.

01:27:12.307 --> 01:27:15.847 line:93%
(Hot Americano, Hot chocolate, Hot latte)

01:27:17.278 --> 01:27:19.047 line:93%
Kwang Soo drives me crazy.

01:27:19.047 --> 01:27:21.648 line:93%
I am playing clean and fair today.

01:27:21.847 --> 01:27:23.917 line:93%
- I am serious. - You are playing fair?

01:27:24.148 --> 01:27:25.158 line:93%
Of course, I am.

01:27:26.618 --> 01:27:29.427 line:93%
Okay. Let's take this to the end. We don't know what will happen.

01:27:29.658 --> 01:27:33.528 line:93%
(They wait for a customer.)

01:27:33.627 --> 01:27:36.028 line:93%
We just need to wait until the next customer comes.

01:27:36.028 --> 01:27:37.868 line:93%
- We should talk. - I see.

01:27:38.637 --> 01:27:40.097 line:93%
This is how a variety show works.

01:27:41.368 --> 01:27:44.108 line:93%
(5 minutes pass.)

01:27:44.108 --> 01:27:46.337 line:93%
(10 minutes pass.)

01:27:46.337 --> 01:27:48.847 line:93%
(20 minutes pass.)

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:51.318 line:93%
(No customer comes.)

01:27:54.377 --> 01:27:55.788 line:93%
(Rustling)

01:27:57.318 --> 01:27:59.387 line:93%
Sung Yong, I need to go to the restroom.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:01.887 line:93%
Do you need to use the restroom?

01:28:01.887 --> 01:28:03.727 line:93%
I am okay. I am okay.

01:28:03.727 --> 01:28:05.698 line:93%
- Do you need to go? - I will be back soon.

01:28:06.028 --> 01:28:09.227 line:93%
(Another 5 minutes pass.)

01:28:10.627 --> 01:28:11.998 line:93%
(The shoot resumes.)

01:28:11.998 --> 01:28:13.398 line:93%
You will go with the menus you chose.

01:28:13.398 --> 01:28:14.467 line:93%
- Yes. - Of course.

01:28:16.408 --> 01:28:18.938 line:93%
I still don't know why I am here.

01:28:18.938 --> 01:28:20.538 line:93%
Where is the trophy?

01:28:20.538 --> 01:28:22.007 line:93%
- Here. - There you go.

01:28:22.007 --> 01:28:23.047 line:93%
(He remembers he was invited as a star with blood type B.)

01:28:23.047 --> 01:28:24.208 line:93%
There you go.

01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:26.118 line:93%
It's an important award.

01:28:26.948 --> 01:28:28.547 line:93%
Lets' play rock-paper-scissors. I want to see my fortune.

01:28:28.547 --> 01:28:29.587 line:93%
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

01:28:29.587 --> 01:28:31.458 line:93%
(Haha wins alone by playing rock.)

01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:32.557 line:93%
What?

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:33.557 line:93%
Two scissors.

01:28:33.557 --> 01:28:35.057 line:93%
(Two scissors.)

01:28:35.488 --> 01:28:37.557 line:93%
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

01:28:38.297 --> 01:28:39.328 line:93%
Rock-paper-scissors

01:28:39.557 --> 01:28:40.998 line:93%
(Kwang Soo wins.)

01:28:40.998 --> 01:28:42.498 line:93%
He ended up winning.

01:28:43.028 --> 01:28:44.028 line:93%
He drives me crazy.

01:28:45.637 --> 01:28:46.898 line:93%
I am in a good mood today.

01:28:47.938 --> 01:28:49.337 line:93%
Me too.

01:28:50.238 --> 01:28:51.238 line:93%
By the way,

01:28:51.837 --> 01:28:54.007 line:93%
I take back my words about removing the water bomb.

01:28:54.007 --> 01:28:56.108 line:93%
(I take back my words about removing the water bomb.)

01:28:56.477 --> 01:28:57.608 line:93%
- What? - I said I'd remove it before.

01:28:57.608 --> 01:28:59.248 line:93%
You can't take back your words.

01:28:59.347 --> 01:29:00.477 line:93%
I just did.

01:29:00.477 --> 01:29:02.748 line:93%
(It's too late.)

01:29:02.748 --> 01:29:03.748 line:93%
Okay.

01:29:04.788 --> 01:29:06.587 line:93%
- A customer is here. - Hold on.

01:29:06.587 --> 01:29:08.858 line:93%
(A customer comes in.)

01:29:08.858 --> 01:29:12.757 line:93%
(A customer comes in after 30 minutes of waiting.)

01:29:13.627 --> 01:29:15.528 line:93%
Hot Americano, please.

01:29:16.097 --> 01:29:18.597 line:93%
(He orders Haha's choice, hot Americano.)

01:29:18.597 --> 01:29:20.137 line:93%
Hey.

01:29:20.137 --> 01:29:21.868 line:93%
(Something is strange.)

01:29:22.837 --> 01:29:23.908 line:93%
Are you drinking it here?

01:29:24.137 --> 01:29:25.238 line:93%
It's to go.

01:29:25.238 --> 01:29:26.238 line:93%
(Why is Kwang Soo upset?)

01:29:26.238 --> 01:29:27.507 line:93%
(What?)

01:29:27.507 --> 01:29:29.347 line:93%
(Who is he?)

01:29:29.547 --> 01:29:32.217 line:93%
(He made people laugh on the show.)

01:29:32.217 --> 01:29:35.347 line:93%
(He was a character who was as pure as snow.)

01:29:35.347 --> 01:29:38.458 line:93%
(Haha's best friend, Park Geun Sik)

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:40.257 line:93%
(No matter which mission he gets...)

01:29:40.887 --> 01:29:42.358 line:93%
(Rice and seasoning)

01:29:42.858 --> 01:29:43.927 line:93%
(With his pure brain,)

01:29:43.927 --> 01:29:46.198 line:93%
(he made his presence known.)

01:29:46.498 --> 01:29:48.568 line:93%
(Did Haha's friend, Geun Sik,)

01:29:48.568 --> 01:29:51.998 line:93%
(visit the cafe by chance?)

01:29:51.998 --> 01:29:53.368 line:93%
Hold on.

01:29:53.368 --> 01:29:54.807 line:93%
(My gosh. I know what's happening now.)

01:29:55.408 --> 01:29:58.208 line:93%
(What on earth happened?)

01:29:58.408 --> 01:29:59.608 line:93%
(10 minutes ago)

01:29:59.608 --> 01:30:01.007 line:93%
Hey, let's go to the restroom.

01:30:02.807 --> 01:30:05.677 line:93%
(Haha said that he was going to the restroom.)

01:30:05.677 --> 01:30:08.017 line:93%
(But why is he coming back without using the restroom?)

01:30:09.417 --> 01:30:10.748 line:93%
Hey, Kwang Soo... Hey, hey.

01:30:11.118 --> 01:30:12.358 line:93%
Hey, where are you now?

01:30:13.087 --> 01:30:14.358 line:93%
I'm pooping.

01:30:14.358 --> 01:30:15.587 line:93%
- You're pooping? - Yes.

01:30:15.587 --> 01:30:17.828 line:93%
Can you come here right now and do a mission with me?

01:30:17.828 --> 01:30:19.028 line:93%
We are in Hongdae.

01:30:19.427 --> 01:30:22.028 line:93%
Come and just say, "Hot Americano, please."

01:30:22.368 --> 01:30:23.627 line:93%
I'll treat you to coffee.

01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:25.667 line:93%
I'll send you the address. Stop pooping, and come right away.

01:30:25.938 --> 01:30:27.667 line:93%
- Okay. - Come as quickly as you can.

01:30:28.007 --> 01:30:30.837 line:93%
(Exactly 5 minutes later...)

01:30:31.538 --> 01:30:33.507 line:93%
- He's here. - Wait.

01:30:33.507 --> 01:30:35.208 line:93%
- Hot Americano, please. - Hold on.

01:30:36.648 --> 01:30:37.807 line:93%
Hey.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.477 line:93%
(He pretends that he doesn't see the camera.)

01:30:39.477 --> 01:30:40.717 line:93%
Hot Americano, please.

01:30:40.948 --> 01:30:42.087 line:93%
Are you drinking it here?

01:30:42.087 --> 01:30:43.318 line:93%
It's to go.

01:30:44.717 --> 01:30:45.917 line:93%
- Hey. - What?

01:30:45.917 --> 01:30:47.158 line:93%
(He pretends to be surprised.)

01:30:47.688 --> 01:30:48.828 line:93%
Hey, Geun Sik, what brings you here?

01:30:48.927 --> 01:30:50.658 line:93%
- Hey. - I came here for a cup of coffee.

01:30:50.658 --> 01:30:51.858 line:93%
My gosh, why are you here?

01:30:51.858 --> 01:30:53.528 line:93%
- Gosh. - Long time, no see.

01:30:53.528 --> 01:30:54.898 line:93%
- What is this? - This is Lee Sang Yeob, the actor.

01:30:54.898 --> 01:30:56.467 line:93%
- Oh, my. Hello. - Are you serious?

01:30:56.498 --> 01:30:58.137 line:93%
- Hey, long time, no see. - Hello.

01:30:58.597 --> 01:30:59.938 line:93%
Hey, Happy New Year.

01:30:59.938 --> 01:31:01.438 line:93%
- Hey, Haha. - You can't do this. Hold on.

01:31:01.467 --> 01:31:03.238 line:93%
- You ordered hot Americano, right? - Yes.

01:31:03.238 --> 01:31:05.337 line:93%
I need to wake up.

01:31:05.708 --> 01:31:07.807 line:93%
What did the customer who just walked in order?

01:31:08.507 --> 01:31:09.648 line:93%
Hot Americano.

01:31:09.648 --> 01:31:11.618 line:93%
(He's brazen.)

01:31:12.047 --> 01:31:13.477 line:93%
- What is this? - What do you mean?

01:31:13.547 --> 01:31:15.118 line:93%
Are we going to play dirty?

01:31:15.288 --> 01:31:16.618 line:93%
Is it ready?

01:31:16.847 --> 01:31:18.387 line:93%
- Seriously? - Let me pay for this.

01:31:18.517 --> 01:31:19.788 line:93%
No, no. Let me pay for this.

01:31:19.788 --> 01:31:21.488 line:93%
- Why don't you take a seat? - Seriously?

01:31:21.688 --> 01:31:22.958 line:93%
But seriously, why are you here?

01:31:23.087 --> 01:31:25.127 line:93%
- I needed coffee. - I can't believe this.

01:31:25.227 --> 01:31:26.398 line:93%
Where are you coming from?

01:31:26.597 --> 01:31:28.167 line:93%
I was at home. I'm on my way to...

01:31:28.267 --> 01:31:29.727 line:93%
He said he always comes to this cafe.

01:31:29.797 --> 01:31:31.198 line:93%
I'm a regular here.

01:31:31.767 --> 01:31:32.938 line:93%
I was sitting there...

01:31:33.167 --> 01:31:35.208 line:93%
and thought how someone could look so alike.

01:31:35.208 --> 01:31:36.368 line:93%
(That's what he thought initially.)

01:31:36.368 --> 01:31:38.108 line:93%
Okay, fine. Fine.

01:31:38.108 --> 01:31:40.137 line:93%
(He enjoys his Americano on a Monday afternoon.)

01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:41.708 line:93%
Fine. We're going all the way today.

01:31:42.108 --> 01:31:43.748 line:93%
- Let's duke this out. - Hey.

01:31:43.977 --> 01:31:46.078 line:93%
But it was hilarious. As soon as he walked in,

01:31:46.078 --> 01:31:47.248 line:93%
I asked if it was him, and he said,

01:31:47.248 --> 01:31:48.618 line:93%
"Hot Americano, please."

01:31:49.887 --> 01:31:51.047 line:93%
(Let's play this dirty then.)

01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:52.288 line:93%
Okay, okay.

01:31:53.658 --> 01:31:54.828 line:93%
Didn't I come really quickly though?

01:31:54.927 --> 01:31:56.658 line:93%
- It took me about three minutes. - Are you serious?

01:31:56.658 --> 01:31:57.828 line:93%
Yes, you were quick.

01:31:58.028 --> 01:31:59.097 line:93%
This is so funny.

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:02.398 line:93%
- I don't know what the last one is. - Geun Sik, you are the best.

01:32:02.467 --> 01:32:03.528 line:93%
Thank you.

01:32:03.898 --> 01:32:04.998 line:93%
- Why are you thanking me? - Have a good day.

01:32:04.998 --> 01:32:06.267 line:93%
- I'm a fan! - What's wrong?

01:32:06.267 --> 01:32:08.137 line:93%
- No, he said the line. - Thank you.

01:32:08.137 --> 01:32:09.738 line:93%
- Have a good day. - See you around.

01:32:09.908 --> 01:32:11.438 line:93%
Please take your seats, and we'll do the last game.

01:32:11.438 --> 01:32:13.377 line:93%
- Okay, okay. I still have a shot. - All right.

01:32:13.377 --> 01:32:14.977 line:93%
- When did you call him? - I won five now.

01:32:15.047 --> 01:32:16.778 line:93%
I feel nervous all of a sudden now.

01:32:17.278 --> 01:32:19.877 line:93%
- He may have more air time than me. - No, no.

01:32:19.977 --> 01:32:21.148 line:93%
Don't you worry.

01:32:21.148 --> 01:32:23.087 line:93%
- He might have more air time. - No, don't worry.

01:32:23.087 --> 01:32:24.248 line:93%
(With the score, 1 to 1, it's the last round.)

01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:25.887 line:93%
- We have to win. - Then for this game,

01:32:25.887 --> 01:32:27.488 line:93%
I might have an advantage.

01:32:27.618 --> 01:32:28.828 line:93%
You don't know that. This is an important one.

01:32:29.927 --> 01:32:33.227 line:93%
- The last choice for Choice of 12. - Please.

01:32:33.898 --> 01:32:37.398 line:93%
A tape has been attached on the floor of this cafe.

01:32:37.398 --> 01:32:39.738 line:93%
- It's near the entrance. - Okay.

01:32:40.267 --> 01:32:42.167 line:93%
Guess the customer's foot over the line.

01:32:42.267 --> 01:32:44.167 line:93%
Choice 1, right foot. Choice 2, left foot.

01:32:44.167 --> 01:32:45.438 line:93%
Choice Three, the customer steps on the line.

01:32:45.438 --> 01:32:47.477 line:93%
(With which foot will the customer pass the line?)

01:32:47.477 --> 01:32:48.578 line:93%
Hold on. Please read the choices again.

01:32:48.578 --> 01:32:50.477 line:93%
Choice 1, right foot. Choice 2, left foot. Choice 3,

01:32:50.477 --> 01:32:52.477 line:93%
- the customer steps on the line. - My gosh. This is too hard.

01:32:53.118 --> 01:32:54.118 line:93%
We are at an advantage.

01:32:54.377 --> 01:32:55.547 line:93%
"The customer steps on the line."

01:32:55.547 --> 01:32:56.788 line:93%
- "The customer steps on the line." - Okay.

01:32:58.417 --> 01:32:59.818 line:93%
Whatever you choose, we'll win.

01:32:59.818 --> 01:33:01.557 line:93%
- Right foot. - Right foot.

01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:03.658 line:93%
"The customer steps on the line."

01:33:04.488 --> 01:33:07.158 line:93%
- Haha, stop it now. - Wait.

01:33:07.158 --> 01:33:08.467 line:93%
Whom do you keep calling?

01:33:08.467 --> 01:33:10.797 line:93%
- Geun Sik, don't go yet. - What are you doing?

01:33:10.797 --> 01:33:12.198 line:93%
- Geun Sik. - What's wrong with this guy?

01:33:12.198 --> 01:33:13.238 line:93%
Geun Sik, don't leave yet.

01:33:13.238 --> 01:33:14.597 line:93%
- What's gotten into you? - All right, all right.

01:33:15.738 --> 01:33:17.637 line:93%
- Okay. - Gosh, that was hilarious.

01:33:17.977 --> 01:33:19.307 line:93%
"The customer steps on the line."

01:33:20.977 --> 01:33:23.507 line:93%
Most people are right-footed, so when they see the line,

01:33:23.708 --> 01:33:26.347 line:93%
they will be compelled to use their right foot.

01:33:26.578 --> 01:33:28.188 line:93%
- Did you choose Choice Three? - Yes.

01:33:28.188 --> 01:33:29.948 line:93%
Whoever wins will get to take Choice Three.

01:33:29.948 --> 01:33:32.118 line:93%
Whoever loses will have to take the left foot.

01:33:33.217 --> 01:33:35.057 line:93%
- I don't want to lose now. - Usually...

01:33:35.057 --> 01:33:36.427 line:93%
Haha, I'm sorry.

01:33:36.427 --> 01:33:38.328 line:93%
- I mean it. - People usually step on the line.

01:33:40.828 --> 01:33:43.498 line:93%
(When he walks in a natural manner, does he end up...)

01:33:43.498 --> 01:33:44.868 line:93%
(stepping on the line?)

01:33:44.868 --> 01:33:46.398 line:93%
This is bound to happen.

01:33:46.568 --> 01:33:48.337 line:93%
This is a given. Seriously.

01:33:49.108 --> 01:33:50.408 line:93%
- Whatever happens, that's a given. - You...

01:33:50.408 --> 01:33:52.137 line:93%
Did you come in with your right foot?

01:33:52.908 --> 01:33:54.408 line:93%
I came in with my right foot first.

01:33:56.807 --> 01:33:58.318 line:93%
Welcome. Please come in.

01:33:58.677 --> 01:34:00.948 line:93%
- Are you guys filming here? - You can come in. Please come in.

01:34:01.217 --> 01:34:02.347 line:93%
I can come in?

01:34:02.788 --> 01:34:03.818 line:93%
Come in.

01:34:04.047 --> 01:34:05.557 line:93%
Don't try to calculate which foot to use now.

01:34:06.717 --> 01:34:08.028 line:93%
(Hesitating)

01:34:08.028 --> 01:34:10.158 line:93%
(Just come in.)

01:34:10.158 --> 01:34:11.297 line:93%
Don't think about it.

01:34:11.698 --> 01:34:12.958 line:93%
- How do we do that? - No, no.

01:34:13.498 --> 01:34:14.828 line:93%
Whatever happens, people will step on it.

01:34:14.868 --> 01:34:16.627 line:93%
- My gosh. - I agree.

01:34:16.627 --> 01:34:17.927 line:93%
- Okay. - That is the right choice.

01:34:17.927 --> 01:34:20.438 line:93%
(Will the next customer step on it like Kwang Soo's prediction?)

01:34:21.467 --> 01:34:22.807 line:93%
- They have to just cross the line. - Okay!

01:34:23.667 --> 01:34:24.837 line:93%
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

01:34:27.977 --> 01:34:29.908 line:93%
(Haha: left foot, Kwang Soo: on the line)

01:34:29.908 --> 01:34:31.177 line:93%
- Then I get the left foot. - Yes.

01:34:31.177 --> 01:34:32.448 line:93%
- Okay. - All right.

01:34:32.818 --> 01:34:33.917 line:93%
I'm almost there!

01:34:33.917 --> 01:34:36.248 line:93%
If I win this game, it's a miracle. It will be incredible.

01:34:36.248 --> 01:34:37.818 line:93%
Haha, it's either the customer steps on it or uses the right foot.

01:34:37.818 --> 01:34:39.387 line:93%
- Your chance is slim. - That's right.

01:34:39.387 --> 01:34:40.658 line:93%
To be honest, I'm not even nervous.

01:34:41.328 --> 01:34:45.627 line:93%
(All they need to do is wait for the next customer.)

01:34:48.467 --> 01:34:49.998 line:93%
He's coming in. He's coming.

01:34:50.597 --> 01:34:52.238 line:93%
- Customers are here. - Customers are here.

01:34:52.238 --> 01:34:54.438 line:93%
(At this moment, two guys walk into the cafe.)

01:34:56.408 --> 01:34:59.408 line:93%
(At this point, he will either use his left foot or step on the line.)

01:34:59.408 --> 01:35:00.408 line:93%
Customers are here.

01:35:00.408 --> 01:35:03.708 line:93%
(Who will be the victor?)

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:05.517 line:93%
(Shortly)

01:35:05.677 --> 01:35:07.448 line:93%
(The last story with Eccentric Master)

01:35:07.618 --> 01:35:09.917 line:93%
(Living with the master still surprises them.)

01:35:09.917 --> 01:35:11.917 line:93%
(His preferences are unapproachable and incomprehensible.)

01:35:12.057 --> 01:35:13.257 line:93%
(What have I just eaten?)

01:35:13.557 --> 01:35:15.328 line:93%
(And above all,)

01:35:15.328 --> 01:35:17.727 line:93%
(the master delivers a heavy blow.)

01:35:17.727 --> 01:35:18.958 line:93%
Your minds are...

01:35:19.328 --> 01:35:21.398 line:93%
("All the Butlers" is coming up soon.)

01:35:21.528 --> 01:35:22.967 line:93%
He's coming in. He's coming.

01:35:23.727 --> 01:35:25.398 line:93%
- Customers are here. - Customers are here.

01:35:25.398 --> 01:35:27.597 line:93%
(At this moment, two guys walk into the cafe.)

01:35:29.507 --> 01:35:32.578 line:93%
(At this point, he will either use his left foot or step on the line.)

01:35:32.578 --> 01:35:33.637 line:93%
Customers are here.

01:35:33.637 --> 01:35:36.977 line:93%
(Who will be the victor?)

01:35:40.248 --> 01:35:43.118 line:93%
(He stepped on the line!)

01:35:45.358 --> 01:35:48.227 line:93%
(Just as Kwang Soo predicted, he steps on the line.)

01:35:51.557 --> 01:35:53.698 line:93%
(He's in despair.)

01:35:53.698 --> 01:35:55.097 line:93%
(Justice is served!)

01:35:55.097 --> 01:35:56.267 line:93%
- Hello. - Welcome.

01:35:57.297 --> 01:35:58.998 line:93%
The third choice is...

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:00.498 line:93%
stepping on the line.

01:36:00.498 --> 01:36:01.908 line:93%
(Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob win in the end.)

01:36:02.837 --> 01:36:05.337 line:93%
(Yes! This is going to be my year!)

01:36:05.578 --> 01:36:07.637 line:93%
(He's frustrated and can't believe what just happened.)

01:36:07.637 --> 01:36:10.007 line:93%
Kwang Soo, who won the mission, will be given 20 ddakjis.

01:36:10.007 --> 01:36:11.377 line:93%
And Sang Yeob...

01:36:11.377 --> 01:36:13.047 line:93%
will receive a small gift that we've prepared.

01:36:13.078 --> 01:36:15.717 line:93%
That's right. You deserve this gift.

01:36:15.717 --> 01:36:17.887 line:93%
Usually, stepping on the line means you are out.

01:36:17.887 --> 01:36:18.887 line:93%
(He holds a grudge.)

01:36:18.887 --> 01:36:20.517 line:93%
(This wraps up the mission with ddakjis.)

01:36:20.517 --> 01:36:22.087 line:93%
(However, the battle for TV rating notice begins now!)

01:36:22.087 --> 01:36:23.087 line:93%
(Next week)

01:36:23.427 --> 01:36:25.398 line:93%
(It's not over until it's over?)

01:36:25.398 --> 01:36:28.167 line:93%
(The war isn't over. It's a team match now!)

01:36:28.398 --> 01:36:29.967 line:93%
(Are you still clueless? It's an individual match in the end.)

01:36:29.967 --> 01:36:31.368 line:93%
I have to win by all means.

01:36:31.767 --> 01:36:34.667 line:93%
(They will only get 5 seconds.)

01:36:34.667 --> 01:36:37.007 line:93%
(Their unprecedented passion to become the center of the clip)

01:36:37.007 --> 01:36:38.738 line:93%
(Or is it their energy?)

01:36:38.738 --> 01:36:41.208 line:93%
Let's go, my story under the sea!

01:36:41.208 --> 01:36:43.108 line:93%
(And)

01:36:43.278 --> 01:36:45.748 line:93%
(Finally, their imagination...)

01:36:45.748 --> 01:36:52.118 line:93%
(comes true.)

01:36:52.118 --> 01:36:54.788 line:93%
(Which member will win?)
