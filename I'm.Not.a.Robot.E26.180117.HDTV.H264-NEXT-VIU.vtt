1
00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.240
It's here. Come inside.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.140
(Episode 26)

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.249
There's no pillar in the middle of the room,

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.081
so you'll be able to use the space as freely as you please.

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.489
We can use this space as the bedroom,

6
00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.489
and we can use that space as the research lab.

7
00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.459
Are you going to get rid of everything here?

8
00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:25.860
If you sign the contract, we'll get rid of everything right away.

9
00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.069
There's something lacking about the x-axis.

10
00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:36.539
More so when it comes to the y-axis.

11
00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:38.370
But the price is...

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.609
- very agreeable. - Very agreeable.

13
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.789
What's wrong?

14
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.099
No, it's nothing.

15
00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:08.869
Doctor Hong.

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.099
Be honest with me.

17
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.709
About what?

18
00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.940
You were scared yesterday because you thought I'd really leave, right?

19
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.509
What... What are you talking about?

20
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.250
Yes.

21
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.420
I was scared.

22
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.789
I didn't expect that to happen, but my heart suddenly froze.

23
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.729
Why are you smiling like that?

24
00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.199
- When did I smile? - You just...

25
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.170
smiled like this.

26
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.970
- Was it weird? - Very.

27
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.410
I wonder if Min Kyu's doing well.

28
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.280
Leave him to Ji A.

29
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.289
The person who knows him best...

30
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.220
is Ji A.

31
00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.160
No matter...

32
00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.630
what you say to me...

33
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.440
or do, I'll be back.

34
00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.680
Tomorrow, the day after...

35
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.579
I'll come back to see you every day.

36
00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.470
It's cold.

37
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.699
It's warm.

38
00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.599
You'll feel warmer if you come closer.

39
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.500
This is just warm enough.

40
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.769
Will she come again tomorrow?

41
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.910
Don't...

42
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.349
Stop letting her in.

43
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.479
Is there...

44
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.220
anything you lied to me about?

45
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.889
If so,

46
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.290
tell me right now.

47
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.860
How can a human get by without lying?

48
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.329
Only angels can.

49
00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:28.399
Did you tell me everything?

50
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:30.639
You promised to buy me an x-ray machine...

51
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.540
and didn't last year.

52
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.139
Do you know the hedgehog story?

53
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.319
They felt so cold, so they huddled together,

54
00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.850
and they pricked each other.

55
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.550
So they scattered.

56
00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.959
But then, they felt so cold,

57
00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:52.730
so they decided to huddle back together.

58
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:57.000
Rather than...

59
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.370
braving the cold on their own,

60
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.670
they'd decided that being pricked by each other...

61
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.269
was more bearable, don't you think?

62
00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.100
Oh dear. My goodness.

63
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.100
Are you okay?

64
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.769
That hurt.

65
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.180
- Are you okay, kid? - Are you all right?

66
00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.839
Tomorrow, the day after...

67
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.110
I'll come back to see you every day.

68
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.649
She...

69
00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.350
lied again.

70
00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.969
(Handwritten statement)

71
00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:34.290
Jo Ji A.

72
00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:35.959
Ji A?

73
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.259
Aji?

74
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:05.409
You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

75
00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.789
Try one of these.

76
00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.659
They're perfect snacks when you're drinking.

77
00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:18.330
Am I your friend?

78
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.899
Who said you can talk like that?

79
00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:43.919
Is the owner of these Heart Balls...

80
00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:47.950
you?

81
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.860
Did you...

82
00:09:57.899 --> 00:09:59.200
read my statement?

83
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:04.939
You came in here to get me to reopen the competition?

84
00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:10.740
That's what it was about.

85
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.750
I wondered why...

86
00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:17.549
the commercials popped up,

87
00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:21.720
why I witnessed protests, and got petitions about the competition.

88
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.389
I have a lot to tell you.

89
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.630
Will you...

90
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.169
listen to me?

91
00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:33.330
No.

92
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.370
What more...

93
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.939
should I listen to in this situation?

94
00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:41.779
You're really...

95
00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:46.210
You have a lot of guts.

96
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.120
How can you keep coming here after that?

97
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.889
What are you?

98
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.419
Are you human?

99
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.559
Oh, you're not much of a human,

100
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.700
and is that why you made a great robot?

101
00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:07.429
I'm sorry.

102
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.409
Shall I tell you what I did before...

103
00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:22.850
I read your statement?

104
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.289
I waited for you.

105
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.720
Like a fool.

106
00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.230
Like a lunatic.

107
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.360
Without any pride.

108
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:43.039
I hate myself for waiting for you.

109
00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:48.110
You deceived me again.

110
00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:52.350
I hate myself for anticipating...

111
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.409
and worrying why you didn't show up.

112
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.419
How silly...

113
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.090
must you think I am?

114
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.230
Did you say that because you knew?

115
00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:08.289
No.

116
00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:11.929
Why didn't you disappear when you were a robot?

117
00:12:12.929 --> 00:12:15.669
Or if you were going to lie, at least don't get caught.

118
00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:19.039
You shouldn't have gotten caught ever!

119
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.380
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.149
You're sorry?

121
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.149
For what? What did you do?

122
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.519
For pretending to be a robot and duping me?

123
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.419
Is that what you're sorry about?

124
00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:39.889
You knew how I feel.

125
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.230
You felt it.

126
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.200
What did you think while you saw and felt all that?

127
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.639
What were you thinking as you watched me tell you...

128
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.580
that I wished you were human?

129
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.250
And yes, the day I reset you.

130
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.850
What a fool you must've thought I was.

131
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:07.289
Was it fun?

132
00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:09.860
How much fun did the rest of you have?

133
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.789
How much did you laugh at me for falling for it?

134
00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:16.630
I'm sorry.

135
00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:19.830
You ignored me on the train.

136
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.639
You pretended not to know me at the restaurant too.

137
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.210
In the warehouse.

138
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.779
The night I told you all those stories.

139
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.480
How did you manage to listen to that? Is that possible?

140
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.080
Is that really possible?

141
00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:40.990
How is it if you knew how I felt?

142
00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:43.419
How could you do this to me?

143
00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:48.259
If I hadn't gone to look for you,

144
00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:52.370
you'd have stayed in hiding.

145
00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:56.740
Why are you back here?

146
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.870
Why? Don't you have any shame?

147
00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.779
Did you ever...

148
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.509
feel anything for me...

149
00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:10.279
for even a second?

150
00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:19.559
Why are you crying?

151
00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:23.059
To prove that you're human?

152
00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:26.899
That's despicable and disgusting.

153
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.700
Get lost.

154
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.470
Does that not compute?

155
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.340
Oh, you're no longer a robot.

156
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.850
Okay, I'll speak to you...

157
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.880
like a human being, so listen up.

158
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.720
Every second I spent with you...

159
00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:49.460
terrifies me now.

160
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.090
I want to delete them all.

161
00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:56.630
I want them all to disappear.

162
00:14:58.159 --> 00:14:59.769
So get out!

163
00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:05.769
Get out of my life forever!

164
00:15:25.793 --> 00:15:30.793

165
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.549
(From Madam X)

166
00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:07.729
Do you know Jang Doo Sam?

167
00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:10.360
Yes, I do.

168
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:14.999
He was the late Chairman Park Sung Jin's driver.

169
00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:19.010
He visited my lab with the chairman all the time.

170
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:20.939
Why...

171
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.939
do you ask?

172
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.280
He has something we can use...

173
00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:27.110
to oust Chairman Hwang.

174
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.249
We must get that...

175
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.350
to help Director Kim...

176
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.620
as well as your team and Aji 3.

177
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.060
I just...

178
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.060
managed to locate Jang Doo Sam.

179
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.399
These are my favorite comic books.

180
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.360
Read them when you're bored.

181
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.669
You'll lose track of time.

182
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.929
What is Ji A's friend doing here?

183
00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:53.199
Why do you think I came here?

184
00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:55.199
To see your face?

185
00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.169
That can't be.

186
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:03.880
I'm here to give and then take away the gift of your life.

187
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.280
Once I leave, you will feel very upset.

188
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.889
- I guarantee that. - I lack the patience to listen.

189
00:19:17.889 --> 00:19:20.790
The Santa Maria Team comes to my cafe often.

190
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.030
They'll find a warehouse and then come back for their stuff.

191
00:19:24.499 --> 00:19:27.169
Ji A will leave for Australia soon.

192
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.600
I don't care.

193
00:19:28.699 --> 00:19:30.469
You must care.

194
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.209
Why else would you let me in?

195
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.179
Now, here's the gift.

196
00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:39.949
Ssanip cried yesterday while talking about yuzu bread.

197
00:19:40.249 --> 00:19:42.780
Hoktal said that one day,

198
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.590
he'll give you an upgraded Beetle.

199
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.860
Ji A spends hours each day cooking for you...

200
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.929
that her hands are full of cuts.

201
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.830
Soon, you'll be left out of their memories.

202
00:19:58.229 --> 00:20:00.100
The memories of the time...

203
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.840
you spent with them will only become memories of your own.

204
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.810
And one day, Ji A will...

205
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.880
meet a man other than you.

206
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.080
Why did Ji A kiss you?

207
00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:19.520
Since when did she...

208
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.389
want to tell you she wasn't a robot?

209
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.090
How did she feel toward a man who said...

210
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.830
he loved her thinking she's a robot?

211
00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:36.840
Aren't the answers to all these questions a gift of life?

212
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.639
A gift more precious...

213
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.949
because they aren't visible and must be felt and believed.

214
00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:55.159
You're about to lose those gifts forever.

215
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:08.870
Did Ji A go out?

216
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.939
Yes, to see her dad.

217
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.880
- Can I have some water? - Stay for dinner.

218
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.050
- Dinner? - Yes.

219
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:29.790
If...

220
00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:32.989
they had told you the truth then,

221
00:21:34.389 --> 00:21:35.959
what do you think would've happened?

222
00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:40.270
Would the joy that Aji 3 was human...

223
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.600
outweigh the feeling of betrayal?

224
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.550
(For rent)

225
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.889
I must be crazy.

226
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.060
What am I doing here?

227
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.330
Here, have some fish cakes.

228
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.870
Have some delicious fish cakes

229
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.239
Be careful. It's hot.

230
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.709
Gosh, this is nice.

231
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.110
Do you think he'll be eating well?

232
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.520
Soon, you'll be left out of their memories.

233
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:33.219
I'm sure he's eating well.

234
00:22:33.219 --> 00:22:36.060
The memories of the time...

235
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.229
you spent with them will only become memories of your own.

236
00:22:42.229 --> 00:22:45.399
Did they call us and tell us to send Aji 3 over?

237
00:22:45.399 --> 00:22:46.469
Not yet.

238
00:22:47.969 --> 00:22:51.969
Hey, that's... That's Min Kyu's car.

239
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.610
- Hold this. - Hey. Hey.

240
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.939
Min Kyu.

241
00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.850
- It's Min Kyu's car. - Min Kyu.

242
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:01.580
Min Kyu.

243
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:07.719
Min Kyu.

244
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.189
- Wait here. - Min Kyu.

245
00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:16.030
- Min Kyu. - Min Kyu.

246
00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:17.760
Min Kyu.

247
00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:20.070
Min Kyu.

248
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.909
- Tell me when you're done. - Thank you.

249
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.350
Dad.

250
00:23:39.689 --> 00:23:41.290
Have you been doing well?

251
00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:45.590
I brought you a gift.

252
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.860
(Jo Sung Cheol)

253
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.780
I managed to do everything well thanks to you.

254
00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.219
The guy I like...

255
00:24:15.419 --> 00:24:18.560
really liked the umbrella and the Heart Balls...

256
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.260
that I had invented.

257
00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:26.929
But I ended up...

258
00:24:28.499 --> 00:24:31.169
hurting him badly by making a mistake.

259
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.840
But I still miss him.

260
00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:42.979
What am I supposed to do?

261
00:25:40.469 --> 00:25:43.179
(I sent the other one to Ji A.)

262
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.989
Tonight, a maximum of 70 stars are expected to...

263
00:25:51.989 --> 00:25:53.820
fall in an hour.

264
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.389
According to the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute,

265
00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:00.260
the Quadrans Muralis will become visible starting tonight,

266
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.630
and it'll cover the entire night sky once it hits the peak.

267
00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:31.959
Is this...

268
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.889
that umbrella?

269
00:26:41.939 --> 00:26:44.840
I didn't know I had two of the same umbrellas.

(Application for KM Financial's New Business Idea Contest)

(Portfolio)

273
00:27:12.929 --> 00:27:15.899
(Business Idea: Transparent Umbrella)

274
00:27:22.439 --> 00:27:24.409
At a certain point,

275
00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:30.179
I started to wonder if I was a useless person.

276
00:27:37.659 --> 00:27:39.630
How did anyone come up with this idea?

277
00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:41.429
Was it a genius?

278
00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:44.229
Or a master?

279
00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:49.939
I want to meet...

280
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.669
the person who made this umbrella.

281
00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.040
One person...

282
00:27:59.149 --> 00:28:01.949
reassured me that I'm useful.

283
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.620
He made me feel that I shouldn't give up.

284
00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:08.860
This is...

285
00:28:09.489 --> 00:28:11.790
exactly when you should kiss.

286
00:30:56.535 --> 00:30:57.535
(I'm Not a Robot)

287
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.860
That's enough.

288
00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:01.959
Thank you for being honest with me.

289
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.300
Thank you for telling me everything I wanted to know.

290
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.570
How can you leave like this?

291
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.139
How can you just abandon me like this?

292
00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:11.439
Don't go.

293
00:31:11.439 --> 00:31:13.909
Now, all that's left is for you to back off.

294
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:17.179
I have one condition. Please do me a favor.

295
00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:19.550
What's going to happen after that?

296
00:31:19.749 --> 00:31:21.010
I love you.

297
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:23.249
Bye, Ji A.

298
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.790
Bye, Aji 3.
