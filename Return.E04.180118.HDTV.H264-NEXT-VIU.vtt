00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:07.956
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:15.224
Hello?

3
00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:16.284
Are you at home?

4
00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:18.054
Yes.

5
00:00:18.054 --> 00:00:20.054
Do you have someone to look after your daughter?

6
00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.223
Yes, I have someone who helps me with my errands.

7
00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:24.894
Okay. Then can we meet now?

8
00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:31.073
Na Ra, have you ever had drinks at a place like this?

9
00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:40.743
Don't pretend to be tough. Drink at your own pace.

10
00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:45.313
Na Ra.

11
00:00:46.584 --> 00:00:48.353
Why did you get married so young?

12
00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:51.093
What do you mean by that?

13
00:00:51.324 --> 00:00:54.093
You were 25 years old. I don't know what gave you...

14
00:00:55.063 --> 00:00:59.194
the courage to give up the job at the big law firm everyone wanted.

15
00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:04.303
Are you asking me if I married him because his family is rich?

16
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.634
I wasn't.

17
00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:10.714
Is that your Achilles heel?

18
00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:13.914
I heard that the most after I got married.

19
00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:17.813
Getting into Seoul National University.

20
00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:21.854
Passing the bar.

21
00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:25.893
All of my efforts were dismissed with my marriage.

22
00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:28.794
If that's the case, what does your marriage...

23
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.863
mean to you?

24
00:01:31.093 --> 00:01:34.203
It's the first decision I made on my own will.

25
00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:37.173
And does your will stem from love?

26
00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:38.904
Trust.

27
00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:43.843
I thought I could...

28
00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:47.613
spend the rest of my life with him.

29
00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:49.443
"Trust"?

30
00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:51.514
I'm pathetic, right?

31
00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:56.923
How could I have trusted a man who cheated on me?

32
00:01:57.093 --> 00:01:59.593
I doubt you meant to choose a guy who was going to cheat on you.

33
00:01:59.593 --> 00:02:01.693
At least not when you were making your decision.

34
00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:06.964
You're here to tell me something, aren't you?

35
00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:09.734
Is it bad news?

36
00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:15.344
I came to tell you that I can't represent Mr. Kang anymore.

37
00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:18.444
I don't think I can do it.

38
00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:21.143
If you can't do it, then where does that leave him?

39
00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:24.113
A number of attorneys, who used to be ministers, can get...

40
00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:26.354
the charge acquitted as long as he pays them well.

41
00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:29.053
You mean he can get away even if he committed the murder.

42
00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:30.553
If he is found not guilty,

43
00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:32.254
no one will know the truth...

44
00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:35.324
except the attorney and the person who did it.

45
00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:38.734
- I guess so. - That frightens me more.

46
00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:46.734
Do you remember the offer I made...

47
00:02:47.403 --> 00:02:48.643
at the party?

48
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:51.643
It still stands.

49
00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:56.113
If you join me on this trial,

50
00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:59.254
you'll get to find out the truth.

51
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.523
And that choice is entirely yours,

52
00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:03.893
Na Ra.

53
00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:25.944
I asked Na Ra,

54
00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:30.143
and she said you like Americano with two extra shots.

55
00:03:31.314 --> 00:03:33.014
Didn't you withdraw?

56
00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:34.384
I was going to,

57
00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:37.094
but I changed my mind after talking to Na Ra.

58
00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:40.023
It's your turn to decide now.

59
00:03:40.023 --> 00:03:42.923
So? Will you work with me?

60
00:03:45.594 --> 00:03:48.803
I'll take that as an agreement, so promise me something.

61
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.333
You must never lie to me.

62
00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:53.944
Okay.

63
00:03:54.173 --> 00:03:57.074
Okay then. Let's begin with the penthouse.

64
00:03:57.074 --> 00:03:59.044
The detective says...

65
00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:02.143
the two of you went in together that night,

66
00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:06.553
and you left alone an hour later.

67
00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:08.083
What could that mean?

68
00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:13.863
Are you saying Mi Jung didn't leave that night?

69
00:04:13.863 --> 00:04:15.664
Not alive, at least.

70
00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:18.563
Impossible.

71
00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:21.803
What happened that night?

72
00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:24.204
We had a big fight by the Han River.

73
00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:26.373
I couldn't just leave like that.

74
00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:34.683
I took a quick shower and changed.

75
00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:43.053
In Ho.

76
00:04:54.964 --> 00:04:56.133
I left after that.

77
00:04:57.373 --> 00:05:02.173
Well, I assumed Mi Jung would wash up and leave as well.

78
00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:05.474
That makes it a "locked room" murder,

79
00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:08.784
and you are the sole suspect.

80
00:05:15.553 --> 00:05:17.993
Wait. Actually...

81
00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:21.094
Come to think of it,

82
00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:23.834
I had left that bag in the penthouse.

83
00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:26.464
The luggage bag which the body was found in?

84
00:05:26.464 --> 00:05:29.633
Yes. Actually, I'm not the only one who utilizes...

85
00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.404
that penthouse.

86
00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:33.844
It was shared among five of us. My three friends...

87
00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:35.644
and Mi Jung.

88
00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:39.313
All five of us have fingerprint access...

89
00:05:39.313 --> 00:05:41.084
into the penthouse.

90
00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:43.654
Which friends?

91
00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:48.954
The victims of a massive car accident just came in.

92
00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:50.923
A request for orthopedic surgery was made...

93
00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:52.493
for a broken hip and a broken femur.

94
00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:55.394
And bed three has a patient with enterorrhexis who needs surgery.

95
00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:58.034
- But what? - I can't find the doctor.

96
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:00.563
Who's on call today?

97
00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:05.803
Seo Joon Hee,

98
00:06:05.974 --> 00:06:08.344
the son of Seo Chang Jong, the head of Daemyung Hospital.

99
00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:14.044
Shoot. What's his problem?

100
00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:17.813
That delivery punk. I ought to run him over.

101
00:06:23.454 --> 00:06:24.594
It's so cold.

102
00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:28.464
- Hey, you. - What's your problem?

103
00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:31.433
- Take off your helmet. - Are you insane?

104
00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.493
Seriously.

105
00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:37.303
- Take it off. - Are you giving me that?

106
00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:38.534
You won't take it off?

107
00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:48.584
Let me hit you just once with this.

108
00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:49.613
Why?

109
00:06:49.613 --> 00:06:51.984
I'm not such a terrible person.

110
00:06:52.214 --> 00:06:55.354
- I'll give you money. - How much will you give me?

111
00:06:55.753 --> 00:06:56.784
Hey, take all of this.

112
00:06:58.423 --> 00:06:59.423
Okay?

113
00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:04.633
You punk.

114
00:07:04.763 --> 00:07:06.334
- Kim Hak Bum... - Don't move.

115
00:07:06.334 --> 00:07:07.964
- of Myungsung Foundation. - Stay still. Punk.

116
00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:09.834
And...

117
00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:13.503
Oh Tae Suk, the CEO of Namo.

118
00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:20.914
Did you wait long?

119
00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:23.313
No, I just got here.

120
00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:25.914
It must be hard.

121
00:07:28.724 --> 00:07:31.693
This is how I am. I grew up having everything,

122
00:07:32.594 --> 00:07:34.664
so I don't know how to console people.

123
00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:43.404
Have you visited In Ho?

124
00:07:43.933 --> 00:07:45.303
Including myself,

125
00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:48.904
Joon Hee and Hak Bum are all too afraid to do so.

126
00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:52.914
We don't know how to face him either.

127
00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:55.613
What about you?

128
00:07:56.414 --> 00:07:57.613
Me too.

129
00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:08.693
I called you to feed you. I assumed you wouldn't be eating.

130
00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:11.863
As you know, Jin Joo only knows...

131
00:08:11.863 --> 00:08:13.734
how to get under people's skin,

132
00:08:14.964 --> 00:08:16.503
so I couldn't really ask her.

133
00:08:17.803 --> 00:08:20.743
Does Jin Joo also know about In Ho?

134
00:08:21.774 --> 00:08:24.414
No. I didn't even tell Hak Bum.

135
00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:26.673
He's too unpredictable.

136
00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:29.484
Thank you.

137
00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:32.283
Not at all. He's like a brother to me.

138
00:08:33.824 --> 00:08:36.883
We need to work together and get In Ho out.

139
00:08:40.263 --> 00:08:42.224
I'm always grateful.

140
00:08:42.863 --> 00:08:43.964
Please eat.

141
00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:09.924
This is the only way to move the body without being caught...

142
00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.393
on the elevator camera.

143
00:10:22.724 --> 00:10:24.663
One of her front teeth was broken.

144
00:10:24.663 --> 00:10:26.594
It could be an interference phenomenon.

145
00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:29.304
It means that the front tooth could have been broken before the murder.

146
00:10:32.734 --> 00:10:33.773
You're right.

147
00:10:36.143 --> 00:10:40.214
The owner of a high-end wine bar wouldn't have left that untreated.

148
00:10:40.743 --> 00:10:42.013
That's unlikely.

149
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.753
Thank you. Bye.

150
00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:55.964
I think I beat you to it.

151
00:10:56.263 --> 00:10:58.163
You must've found something.

152
00:10:58.663 --> 00:11:02.334
There are no cameras from the staircase to the garage.

153
00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.873
What does that mean? That's how the body was moved.

154
00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:08.003
Thank you. I'll consider it.

155
00:11:08.574 --> 00:11:10.474
It's very difficult to get in.

156
00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:12.113
I had to show them my badge,

157
00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:15.043
appease them, and beg them. It was so hard.

158
00:11:15.643 --> 00:11:16.814
I'm so tired.

159
00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:23.694
Next time, call ahead and ask for cooperation.

160
00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.064
What's the point in going in? They won't cooperate.

161
00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:32.694
Ask anything.

162
00:11:35.204 --> 00:11:37.304
I'm a fan.

163
00:11:37.734 --> 00:11:38.804
Thank you.

164
00:11:40.503 --> 00:11:44.674
Has there been a memorable event recently...

165
00:11:44.674 --> 00:11:47.714
involving the penthouse residents?

166
00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:50.913
It was about a week ago.

167
00:11:50.913 --> 00:11:52.454
It was... Just a minute.

168
00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:56.783
Okay. Let me see...

169
00:11:59.324 --> 00:12:00.993
I worked on the third.

170
00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:05.663
So I was having instant noodles for a late lunch.

171
00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:08.964
I heard a noise from the stairway...

172
00:12:08.964 --> 00:12:10.773
as if something was crashing down.

173
00:12:14.844 --> 00:12:16.204
Is someone there?

174
00:12:20.814 --> 00:12:21.883
My apologies.

175
00:12:22.913 --> 00:12:25.814
He was kissing a woman up against the wall.

176
00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:28.354
- Who was? - Mr. Oh.

177
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:32.194
Are you referring to Mr. Oh Tae Suk, the CEO of Namo?

178
00:12:32.194 --> 00:12:33.293
Yes.

179
00:12:33.424 --> 00:12:35.694
Did you see the woman's face?

180
00:12:35.763 --> 00:12:36.763
Yes, I did.

181
00:12:37.564 --> 00:12:38.564
It's her.

182
00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:39.863
"Her"?

183
00:12:39.964 --> 00:12:42.234
You know, the woman who frequently visits the penthouse.

184
00:12:44.003 --> 00:12:45.503
Are you certain?

185
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.903
There's a big mole on the back of her hand.

186
00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:50.873
Gosh, don't get me started.

187
00:12:50.873 --> 00:12:54.613
She must've drunk too much. I checked again later while on patrol,

188
00:12:55.684 --> 00:12:58.153
and there was vomit all over the staircase.

189
00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:05.653
Hey, Na Ra.

190
00:13:06.293 --> 00:13:07.763
I just had a few questions.

191
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:09.663
Is there...

192
00:13:10.263 --> 00:13:13.293
a big mole on the back of Yum Mi Jung's hand?

193
00:13:13.663 --> 00:13:15.434
Yes, I believe so.

194
00:13:15.903 --> 00:13:18.074
I remember seeing it at the dinner.

195
00:13:22.804 --> 00:13:24.974
I'm positive. It was pretty big.

196
00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:26.944
Why do you ask?

197
00:13:27.184 --> 00:13:29.013
I need to look into it more,

198
00:13:29.013 --> 00:13:31.084
but if this witness' statement is true,

199
00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:34.984
I think it can prove Mr. Kang's innocence.

200
00:13:35.123 --> 00:13:36.623
Oh, really?

201
00:13:37.094 --> 00:13:39.993
And if you have a photo of Oh Tae Suk, Kim Hak Bum,

202
00:13:40.724 --> 00:13:44.133
and Seo Joon Hee all together, could you send it to me?

203
00:13:45.263 --> 00:13:47.204
How do you know them, Ja Hye?

204
00:13:48.964 --> 00:13:51.403
Right. You saw them at your party.

205
00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:52.804
Okay, I'll send it to you.

206
00:13:53.273 --> 00:13:54.304
Please do.

(November 4, 1999, "Happy Times")

209
00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:51.464
(National Forensic Service)

210
00:14:52.464 --> 00:14:53.934
What do you want to ask me?

211
00:14:54.663 --> 00:14:56.604
When I read the report,

212
00:14:57.204 --> 00:14:59.434
it said that Yum Mi Jung's time of death...

213
00:15:00.174 --> 00:15:04.074
was between 11pm on November 27 to 2am on the next day.

214
00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:06.674
That's what it said on the report. Is this a definite conclusion?

215
00:15:06.844 --> 00:15:09.243
The detective told me that the food...

216
00:15:09.413 --> 00:15:12.613
found in her stomach matched the dinner she had...

217
00:15:12.613 --> 00:15:14.184
before she disappeared.

218
00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:18.253
I was informed that they finished dinner after 8pm.

219
00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:21.263
So even if the victim suffered from acute gastritis,

220
00:15:21.793 --> 00:15:24.863
she was killed within 4 to 5 hours based on the state of the food.

221
00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:29.604
But she was murdered on the 27th, and her body was found on the 4th.

222
00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:32.234
It means she was found a week after she had been murdered.

223
00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:34.944
Despite all that, her body wasn't decomposed at all.

224
00:15:34.944 --> 00:15:36.444
I already explained this to the detective.

225
00:15:38.013 --> 00:15:39.974
It showed signs of being refrigerated.

226
00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:41.383
It was refrigerated?

227
00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:46.783
The murderer refrigerated the entire body?

228
00:15:47.854 --> 00:15:48.924
Is that possible?

229
00:15:49.023 --> 00:15:50.594
It would be possible if it were somewhere like a hospital?

230
00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:53.663
Or the murderer could have put the body in a massive refrigerator.

231
00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:59.163
Yes. There's a high chance that the woman the security guard...

232
00:15:59.464 --> 00:16:01.704
saw at the penthouse on the third might not be Yum Mi Jung.

233
00:16:02.763 --> 00:16:06.334
Well, it seems like the murderer refrigerated the body.

234
00:16:30.763 --> 00:16:31.763
Hi.

235
00:16:33.064 --> 00:16:34.863
You must look like your daddy.

236
00:16:35.903 --> 00:16:36.903
Pardon?

237
00:16:36.903 --> 00:16:38.974
Na Ra, we meet again.

238
00:16:39.974 --> 00:16:41.604
Put your muscles into good use.

239
00:16:42.444 --> 00:16:43.444
Why don't you help?

240
00:16:45.344 --> 00:16:46.373
How sweet.

241
00:16:47.084 --> 00:16:48.543
Your husband is one lucky man.

242
00:16:49.814 --> 00:16:51.714
He has a wife with great moral values...

243
00:16:52.253 --> 00:16:54.023
and a beautiful face.

244
00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:57.694
I don't think I'm In Ho's type.

245
00:16:57.753 --> 00:16:59.854
You're definitely not my type.

246
00:17:15.944 --> 00:17:17.114
I need to step out.

247
00:17:17.543 --> 00:17:18.644
What? This late?

248
00:17:18.743 --> 00:17:20.984
Don't ask why. Can you go to sleep first?

249
00:17:55.184 --> 00:17:57.884
Wake up. Why are you still sleeping?

250
00:17:58.083 --> 00:18:00.523
Mommy is a sleepyhead.

251
00:18:00.654 --> 00:18:02.124
Come on out now!

252
00:18:02.884 --> 00:18:06.224
Mommy will faint out of happiness when she sees this.

253
00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:07.763
She will faint.

254
00:18:08.523 --> 00:18:09.563
Right?

255
00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:10.634
Let's go, sweetie.

256
00:18:14.563 --> 00:18:15.563
All right.

257
00:18:16.974 --> 00:18:18.003
Are you up now?

258
00:18:18.273 --> 00:18:20.444
Come here. Give me a kiss for sleeping in this morning.

259
00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:47.734
Dal Rae.

260
00:18:48.063 --> 00:18:51.204
I think Mommy is more touched than I thought she'd be.

261
00:18:53.743 --> 00:18:55.204
What happened, In Ho?

262
00:18:57.444 --> 00:18:59.013
I'm not following you.

263
00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:01.243
You can't be here because you were arrested...

264
00:19:01.243 --> 00:19:02.714
on the grounds of Mi Jung's murder.

265
00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:06.283
Did you have a nightmare? Who is Mi Jung?

266
00:19:06.454 --> 00:19:08.023
You're the only woman I know.

267
00:19:13.424 --> 00:19:17.164
You don't know what I went through because I thought it was real.

268
00:19:20.164 --> 00:19:21.904
Don't you ever leave me again.

269
00:19:24.934 --> 00:19:25.974
I won't.

270
00:19:26.303 --> 00:19:27.374
Please don't leave.

271
00:19:28.073 --> 00:19:29.174
I'm not going anywhere.

272
00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.043
Don't go.

273
00:20:20.194 --> 00:20:21.194
Come in.

274
00:20:26.063 --> 00:20:28.934
Hi, I'm Choi Ja Hye, who called earlier. We've met before.

275
00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:31.803
Yes, we met at your opening party.

276
00:20:32.374 --> 00:20:34.843
I heard you're representing In Ho.

277
00:20:34.974 --> 00:20:36.003
It's nice to see you again.

278
00:20:36.243 --> 00:20:38.874
I've felt it on that day too, but you look much better in person.

279
00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.184
Anyway, why did you want to meet me?

280
00:20:43.414 --> 00:20:47.353
I wanted to ask you to spare some time regarding Mr. Kang's case.

281
00:20:47.353 --> 00:20:50.954
Sure. He's like a brother to me. I'll do anything I can do to help.

282
00:20:50.954 --> 00:20:53.053
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.

283
00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:55.724
I know you're very busy, so I was a bit hesitant.

284
00:20:55.724 --> 00:20:58.333
Please don't be. Why don't you take a seat first?

285
00:21:08.404 --> 00:21:10.144
How is his case going?

286
00:21:10.343 --> 00:21:11.874
I'm doing my best.

287
00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:13.313
That's not enough.

288
00:21:14.043 --> 00:21:16.614
Whatever happens, we must get him out.

289
00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:20.184
I'll make sure that happens regardless of the cost.

290
00:21:20.184 --> 00:21:24.253
Mr. Kang must be so happy to have a loyal friend like you.

291
00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:27.993
How can I be of help to you?

292
00:21:28.263 --> 00:21:31.763
I don't need a lot. I just need you to answer one question.

293
00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:36.904
With whom were you at the penthouse on December 3?

294
00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:43.144
A witness claims you were there with a woman who resembled Ms. Yum.

295
00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:45.874
I know it's impossible.

296
00:21:46.273 --> 00:21:49.843
For your information, the time of death was six days ago.

297
00:21:58.154 --> 00:21:59.253
This is...

298
00:22:00.263 --> 00:22:02.763
difficult to answer. It's private.

299
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.864
But I will answer it if this helps In Ho's case.

300
00:22:08.533 --> 00:22:10.033
I needed a woman to sleep with.

301
00:22:10.303 --> 00:22:11.303
In broad daylight?

302
00:22:13.434 --> 00:22:15.674
My gosh, I'm sorry. Excuse my manners.

303
00:22:17.043 --> 00:22:20.013
I will keep it confidential since this is private.

304
00:22:35.424 --> 00:22:38.093
- Joon Hee, are you busy? - No. What's up?

305
00:22:38.434 --> 00:22:39.464
Earlier today,

306
00:22:41.003 --> 00:22:42.434
In Ho's lawyer came to see me.

307
00:22:43.934 --> 00:22:46.634
- How is he doing? - Anyway, she asked me...

308
00:22:47.003 --> 00:22:48.474
about that day.

309
00:22:50.144 --> 00:22:51.273
Be careful.

310
00:22:51.273 --> 00:22:52.874
I'll tell Hak Bum.

311
00:22:56.984 --> 00:22:58.454
- Hey. - Yes?

312
00:22:58.454 --> 00:22:59.614
Give me my phone.

313
00:23:09.724 --> 00:23:11.993
Why do you keep calling?

314
00:23:12.593 --> 00:23:13.803
Where are you?

315
00:23:14.404 --> 00:23:16.434
I'm getting a massage because I'm tired.

316
00:23:17.073 --> 00:23:18.634
In Ho's lawyer came by this afternoon...

317
00:23:18.634 --> 00:23:20.103
and asked about that day.

318
00:23:23.974 --> 00:23:26.073
- Why? - I don't know. I don't like it.

319
00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:27.644
What about you?

320
00:23:30.414 --> 00:23:32.384
You deleted the video from the dash cam, right?

321
00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:36.353
You didn't do it yet?

322
00:23:36.924 --> 00:23:38.493
I erased it.

323
00:23:41.993 --> 00:23:44.394
Make sure nothing goes wrong, okay?

324
00:23:47.803 --> 00:23:49.704
Darn it.

325
00:23:59.914 --> 00:24:01.283
Seriously.

328
00:24:24.904 --> 00:24:27.073
What were you two doing?

329
00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:29.273
1, 2, 3.

330
00:24:34.484 --> 00:24:37.513
Hey. What do we do now?

331
00:24:38.283 --> 00:24:40.353
Should we dig a hole and bury it?

332
00:24:41.154 --> 00:24:42.424
You crazy jerk.

333
00:24:54.434 --> 00:24:56.533
(Delete?)

334
00:25:16.654 --> 00:25:18.553
(Return)

335
00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:21.394
Do you know what those jerks did...

336
00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:23.293
while knowing their parents will protect them?

337
00:25:23.293 --> 00:25:25.394
- This is murder. - We hid a body.

338
00:25:25.394 --> 00:25:26.864
We did it together. Did you forget?

339
00:25:26.864 --> 00:25:29.904
We need to find Seo Joon Hee to prove Kang In Ho's innocence.

340
00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:33.103
I came to the police station to see In Ho right now.

341
00:25:33.103 --> 00:25:36.003
It'll be a pain for everyone if we get involved with Mi Jung.

342
00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:38.843
Mr. Kim? This is an emergency. Get going.

343
00:25:38.843 --> 00:25:41.283
Are you saying you know who killed Mi Jung?

344
00:25:41.283 --> 00:25:42.543
One thing is for certain.

345
00:25:42.543 --> 00:25:45.154
I'll prove In Ho's innocence.
