00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:10.685
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.058
You also know how much your dad...

3
00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:15.329
despised Soo Ho.

4
00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:19.269
Does Soo Ho also know...

5
00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.898
Look for the articles right away.

6
00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:23.968
how he tried to send him to an orphanage?

7
00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:29.279
You're horrible.

8
00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.008
Don't you feel bad for him?

9
00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.148
You're the one who made money...

10
00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:34.819
with the stolen documents written by Doctor Moon.

11
00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.889
What did you say? Shut your mouth.

12
00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.218
If you send him to an orphanage,

13
00:00:40.758 --> 00:00:42.258
I'm going to run away too.

14
00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.529
Once Soo Ho begins to investigate his past,

15
00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:50.798
he'll find everything about your dad too.

16
00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.368
We can discuss everything else in person.

17
00:00:57.768 --> 00:00:58.838
Do you want to listen to music?

18
00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:00.368
Is there something you want?

19
00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.438
No.

20
00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:07.518
What are you thinking about?

21
00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:12.848
Can we take a walk for a bit?

22
00:01:25.628 --> 00:01:27.598
What's wrong? You seem down.

23
00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:29.798
Is it because of the old house?

24
00:01:32.068 --> 00:01:33.669
How did you put up with it?

25
00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:35.109
Pardon?

26
00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:38.678
You probably knew that...

27
00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:42.348
my parents were nice to you only out of courtesy.

28
00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:44.188
Well...

29
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.249
It must've been really hard on you

30
00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:51.559
Still, it was better than staying in a dormitory.

31
00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.259
I got to see you during breaks.

32
00:01:58.298 --> 00:01:59.568
My dad...

33
00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.399
was going to send you to an orphanage.

34
00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.169
I saw the application form...

35
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:10.509
and talked back to him for the first time.

36
00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:15.879
You've been protecting me since then.

37
00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.449
No.

38
00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:21.189
You went abroad to study...

39
00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.159
before my dad sent you to an orphanage.

40
00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:26.558
I would've turned out well even if I grew up there.

41
00:02:26.558 --> 00:02:27.759
So what's the problem?

42
00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.969
Doctor Moon wasn't killed by the fire.

43
00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:35.699
Your dad killed him.

44
00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.678
Do you have anything else to say?

45
00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.509
No.

46
00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:47.648
Hae Ra.

47
00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:51.189
It's too cold. Let's go.

48
00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:53.958
You said you wanted to buy fruits.

49
00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:55.018
Yes.

50
00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:57.289
Your nose is running.

51
00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.129
- You're lying. - You got me.

52
00:03:06.428 --> 00:03:08.569
Tell me about the new evidence and witness.

53
00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.298
There are so many of them.

54
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:12.808
Are they related to Chairman Park?

55
00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.909
Some are construction firm executives.

56
00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.379
What else?

57
00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.849
Is there something you heard?

58
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:23.849
No.

59
00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:26.488
Let's buy some apples and pears.

60
00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:00.618
What's wrong?

61
00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.659
Is there more stuff to buy?

62
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:06.928
Just meat.

63
00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:08.998
Okay. Let's get that and go home.

64
00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.979
Didn't we say we'd never see each other again?

65
00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.988
I never knew Gon was your son.

66
00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:32.948
I only found out later that...

67
00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:34.388
he worked for Chul Min Development.

68
00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.459
Why did you want to see me?

69
00:04:38.688 --> 00:04:41.198
Your son wants me to pay three times the penalty.

70
00:04:41.258 --> 00:04:43.329
Please waiver the penalty.

71
00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.669
Then I'll give you a small gift.

72
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.198
A gift?

73
00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:50.669
I won't tell Mr. Moon...

74
00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.138
about the incident from the past.

75
00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:56.008
It turns out that he's Dr. Moon's son.

76
00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.089
The incident from the past.

77
00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:07.219
What was that incident?

78
00:05:08.318 --> 00:05:11.758
I'll consider the penalty waived.

79
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.269
I'm off to work.

80
00:05:33.178 --> 00:05:35.979
It would've been better if you didn't exist.

81
00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.118
Give Dal Hong his property back.

82
00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:41.719
Dad.

83
00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.329
Don't ever see him again.

84
00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.859
Even if he disappears, don't wonder about him.

85
00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.298
Got it?

86
00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:00.539
The lab was burned down,

87
00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.779
and my father died in the fire.

88
00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:09.378
Why are you watching the show...

89
00:06:09.378 --> 00:06:11.289
Hae Ra's boyfriend was on?

90
00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.948
He's not Hae Ra's boyfriend.

91
00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:14.888
- Then, - The checkup's thorough.

92
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:17.459
is he her husband?

93
00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:22.198
Never mind.

94
00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:25.669
I think the fire wasn't caused by a short circuit.

95
00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.169
I believe those who'd benefit from...

96
00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.899
demolishing the lab did it.

97
00:06:29.438 --> 00:06:32.469
Was Chul Min one of the ones who benefited?

98
00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:35.479
Hey.

99
00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:38.508
Make me some spring clothes.

100
00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:41.479
I want a pair of pants, a half-coat,

101
00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.019
a long dress, and a mini skirt.

102
00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.548
And starting tomorrow,

103
00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:48.459
let's go find Jeom Bok together.

104
00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.628
You're ordering clothes...

105
00:06:51.628 --> 00:06:53.488
to keep me working here,

106
00:06:53.488 --> 00:06:55.758
and asking me to find him to drag me around.

107
00:06:56.698 --> 00:06:59.329
You're trying to keep me away from Soo Ho's house.

108
00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:01.539
I see you're not dumb.

109
00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:04.568
I saw Chul Min.

110
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:08.238
Where did you see him?

111
00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:09.508
Around here.

112
00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:12.178
He came here and left his name card.

113
00:07:12.178 --> 00:07:13.909
How did he know about this place?

114
00:07:14.448 --> 00:07:16.318
I don't know about that.

115
00:07:16.378 --> 00:07:18.849
He said he wanted to develop the area.

116
00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:20.188
What did he say to you?

117
00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:22.359
Seo Rin.

118
00:07:23.388 --> 00:07:26.488
I became rich because of you.

119
00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:31.868
He's been in love with me all this time.

120
00:07:32.298 --> 00:07:33.769
Don't think about seeing him.

121
00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.839
Don't think about using him either.

122
00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:40.138
He became old and ugly.

123
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.438
After seeing him, I got too sad and got sick.

124
00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.178
He's a monster who only cares about money.

125
00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:52.149
How do you know that?

126
00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.719
Have you met him?

127
00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:56.618
He has become a notorious speculator.

128
00:07:57.058 --> 00:07:59.459
There are a lot of things you don't tell me about.

129
00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:01.329
You're better off not hearing them.

130
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:06.899
I'll make your clothes pretty.

131
00:08:08.368 --> 00:08:11.709
Hey. I'm not done talking here.

132
00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:27.758
Did she sharpen a knife?

133
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:49.179
Wait. What's this?

134
00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:52.049
- Stop! - Stop this now!

135
00:08:52.079 --> 00:08:53.809
- Stop! - Stop!

136
00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:55.449
- What's this? - Stop there.

137
00:08:56.219 --> 00:08:58.549
- Goodness. - What is that?

138
00:08:58.988 --> 00:09:00.689
Gosh.

139
00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:03.758
What?

140
00:09:05.258 --> 00:09:06.388
Now?

141
00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:11.229
Did you call the police?

142
00:09:12.128 --> 00:09:13.429
Okay. I'll be right there.

143
00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:15.138
Meet me there.

144
00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:17.469
What's wrong?

145
00:09:17.908 --> 00:09:19.238
It's nothing.

146
00:09:19.368 --> 00:09:20.538
I won't be late.

147
00:09:20.538 --> 00:09:22.138
You should go in first. I'm sorry.

148
00:09:42.998 --> 00:09:44.168
Okay.

149
00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:49.868
That's strange.

150
00:09:50.908 --> 00:09:53.268
I can't believe a skeleton was found here.

151
00:09:58.309 --> 00:09:59.748
What happened?

152
00:09:59.878 --> 00:10:02.118
It looks like it's been dead for over 10 years.

153
00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:03.988
They need to run a test to be sure.

154
00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:07.988
Until 10 years ago, this lot was far from a road.

155
00:10:07.988 --> 00:10:09.959
So it wasn't easy to access.

156
00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.258
Even after roads were paved,

157
00:10:11.258 --> 00:10:13.758
no buildings were built here.

158
00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:15.929
Was there anything else?

159
00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:19.028
We didn't find an ID card or anything with him.

160
00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:20.469
His clothes are all worn out.

161
00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:22.038
They said they'd start the investigation...

162
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.538
with the list of missing people.

163
00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:24.939
We told them we'd let them know...

164
00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:26.638
if we found something as well.

165
00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:29.378
Do at least a simple memorial service...

166
00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:31.408
for him tomorrow.

167
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:33.679
He was able to be found...

168
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.778
because Mr. Moon began the construction.

169
00:10:36.148 --> 00:10:37.349
If he had a resentful death,

170
00:10:37.349 --> 00:10:38.949
he'd be grateful to us for finding him.

171
00:10:39.349 --> 00:10:40.349
Okay.

172
00:10:43.888 --> 00:10:46.488
You shouldn't think it's bad luck.

173
00:10:46.488 --> 00:10:47.729
Don't worry.

174
00:10:48.658 --> 00:10:50.398
I hope he goes back to his family.

175
00:10:50.898 --> 00:10:52.898
We'll resolve his resentment.

176
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:55.099
This is a good thing.

177
00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:21.528
Are you asleep?

178
00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:24.028
No.

179
00:11:29.368 --> 00:11:30.908
We had a problem in the construction site.

180
00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:32.209
But it's been solved well.

181
00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.738
Was it about the construction site?

182
00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:38.648
Yes, at the hanok hotel construction site.

183
00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:40.508
Did anyone get injured?

184
00:11:41.148 --> 00:11:42.518
No, you don't need to worry.

185
00:11:47.118 --> 00:11:48.918
Come here and have some strawberries.

186
00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:52.158
I'll go first.

187
00:11:52.158 --> 00:11:53.158
Okay.

188
00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:01.099
Are you feeling any better?

189
00:12:01.368 --> 00:12:02.569
I'm all right.

190
00:12:03.138 --> 00:12:04.738
You look so young,

191
00:12:04.738 --> 00:12:06.839
but I guess you do get sick.

192
00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:09.079
No one will think you're in your 40s.

193
00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:12.849
What do you mean, I'm in my 40s?

194
00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.679
That's not funny.

195
00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.549
When Hae Ra first visited your tailor shop,

196
00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:21.288
you must've been 27 or 28 years old.

197
00:12:21.288 --> 00:12:23.758
That's about 15 years ago.

198
00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:25.788
I was 18 years old then.

199
00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:27.599
What?

200
00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:31.569
Why would you talk about age?

201
00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:34.038
It's not trendy to ask about one's age,

202
00:12:34.038 --> 00:12:35.398
educational background, and father's job.

203
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:37.439
Citrus tea is good for cold.

204
00:12:38.268 --> 00:12:40.408
Hae Ra, you're very nice to me.

205
00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:43.609
Because I like pretty people.

206
00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:46.248
Have a lot of fruits too.

207
00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:49.618
What's that ring?

208
00:12:49.778 --> 00:12:50.819
Oh, this?

209
00:12:52.049 --> 00:12:53.319
I got it as a gift.

210
00:12:53.819 --> 00:12:57.118
It looks like a queen's ring.

211
00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.488
Can I take a look at it?

212
00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:00.959
Sure.

213
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.559
When will the hotel construction be completed?

214
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:32.758
Maybe in spring next year.

215
00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:34.059
Once it's done,

216
00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:36.299
let's go see it together.

217
00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:37.868
Of course.

218
00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:47.168
- Goodness. - Are you okay?

219
00:14:01.018 --> 00:14:02.658
Tell me where you're hurting.

220
00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.258
Should I call an ambulance?

221
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.538
I'm okay.

222
00:14:20.638 --> 00:14:22.538
I get stomach cramps from time to time...

223
00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:24.209
when my health condition isn't all right.

224
00:14:27.719 --> 00:14:29.719
Are you sure you don't have to go to a hospital?

225
00:14:29.719 --> 00:14:30.949
I'm all right.

226
00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:33.089
I'll go rest in my room.

227
00:14:48.738 --> 00:14:50.469
- Yes? - It's me.

228
00:14:58.679 --> 00:14:59.878
I found this in my room.

229
00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:02.079
I put it there on purpose.

230
00:15:04.049 --> 00:15:05.549
When did you come into my room?

231
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:08.118
I went in only to put it there.

232
00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:10.758
I want to be in your room as well then.

233
00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:22.699
Come in.

234
00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:33.709
I like your room.

235
00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:36.918
It's only a tenant's room.

236
00:15:43.388 --> 00:15:44.459
I remember this photo.

237
00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:45.729
It was during the Chuseok holiday.

238
00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:47.059
Right.

239
00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:49.699
I felt sorry because we took it without you.

240
00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:01.079
How did your father pass away?

241
00:16:04.278 --> 00:16:06.209
He was on his business trip.

242
00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:09.648
I got a call that he collapsed from overwork.

243
00:16:09.878 --> 00:16:11.819
My mom collapsed in shock.

244
00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:14.319
I spent a few days in a hectic.

245
00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:16.189
Gon's father came...

246
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:17.589
and said he took care of it well.

247
00:16:17.589 --> 00:16:19.589
Did you check the hospital record?

248
00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:22.258
Young Mi's parents checked the record.

249
00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:23.528
I see.

250
00:16:24.128 --> 00:16:26.429
Can I see them?

251
00:16:26.628 --> 00:16:28.138
They're in Canada.

252
00:16:28.138 --> 00:16:30.069
They'll come to Korea for Young Mi's wedding.

253
00:16:30.738 --> 00:16:32.309
Can you call Young Mi...

254
00:16:32.609 --> 00:16:34.878
and tell her that I want to talk to her parents?

255
00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:36.878
Why?

256
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.679
To check if Chairman Park told the truth.

257
00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:40.849
Please ask her today.

258
00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:42.549
Okay.

259
00:16:44.118 --> 00:16:45.748
It's been a while since we last talked to each other.

260
00:16:45.748 --> 00:16:48.059
You must be busy with your dating.

261
00:16:48.158 --> 00:16:50.628
Are your parents still in Canada?

262
00:16:50.628 --> 00:16:51.788
It's cold during this time,

263
00:16:51.788 --> 00:16:53.258
so they might be in San Diego now.

264
00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:01.799
Why do you ask about the incident suddenly?

265
00:17:01.969 --> 00:17:04.739
Soo Ho must want to ask something.

266
00:17:05.509 --> 00:17:07.109
It happened such a long time ago,

267
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.079
so I'm not sure if my parents remember it well.

268
00:17:10.678 --> 00:17:12.478
It's about your father,

269
00:17:12.478 --> 00:17:14.049
so why is he curious about it?

270
00:17:14.249 --> 00:17:15.978
Because he stayed in my house...

271
00:17:15.978 --> 00:17:18.089
for two years like family.

272
00:17:18.188 --> 00:17:20.349
Okay.

273
00:17:21.388 --> 00:17:22.618
I'll talk to them.

274
00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:23.789
Thanks.

275
00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:33.599
Why would you go through my study?

276
00:17:33.898 --> 00:17:35.368
What are you suspecting?

277
00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:38.509
He handed me this paper...

278
00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:40.009
so that I can check if it can be commercialized.

279
00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:41.039
Don't you remember?

280
00:17:42.638 --> 00:17:44.178
Moon Joon Seong...

281
00:17:44.749 --> 00:17:45.908
handed it to you?

282
00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:49.349
Yes, I told you about this before.

283
00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:51.289
What are you two scheming...

284
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:53.749
without me?

285
00:17:54.388 --> 00:17:56.519
Why do you keep changing in a strange way?

286
00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.259
Hae Ra's friends are downstairs.

287
00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:00.158
You snuck in and went through my study.

288
00:18:00.158 --> 00:18:02.329
What are you doing like a rat?

289
00:18:02.428 --> 00:18:03.658
A rat?

290
00:18:07.438 --> 00:18:08.539
A rat?

291
00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:16.009
I didn't see anything...

292
00:18:16.938 --> 00:18:18.349
on Hae Ra's birthday...

293
00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:21.478
and the other night either.

294
00:18:23.349 --> 00:18:24.489
I don't remember a thing.

295
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:27.688
I don't.

296
00:18:39.628 --> 00:18:41.069
Stop being mad at me.

297
00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:09.099
Don't be so touched by these little flowers.

298
00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:13.628
I'll be nicer.

299
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.069
Let's go to Gangneung to see the night sea.

300
00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:20.239
Now?

301
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:21.539
Yes, now.

302
00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:23.839
If I don't,

303
00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:25.749
I might go crazy out of suffocation.

304
00:19:28.378 --> 00:19:29.878
Okay, let's go.

305
00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:34.519
Thanks.

306
00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.819
Please close the store for me.

307
00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:52.868
(I'm a researcher who used to work with Doctor Moon.)

308
00:19:59.249 --> 00:20:00.609
(I'm a researcher who used to work with Doctor Moon.)

309
00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:05.148
(Doctor Moon was killed by his friend, Mr. Jung.)

310
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:12.829
(I'll send you the evidence soon.)

311
00:20:27.478 --> 00:20:29.279
You're up.

312
00:20:31.408 --> 00:20:34.019
Mr. Moon went out early in the morning,

313
00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:36.249
and Hae Ra just went to work too.

314
00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:38.849
Everyone seems busy.

315
00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:41.989
Mr. Moon left you some medicine...

316
00:20:41.989 --> 00:20:43.718
for your fatigue and stomachache.

317
00:20:43.989 --> 00:20:45.489
(Gastrointestinal agents)

318
00:20:46.158 --> 00:20:47.759
I'll thank him later.

319
00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:49.799
And Hae Ra made some porridge.

320
00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:50.999
Have some.

321
00:20:53.228 --> 00:20:54.299
Aunt Sook Hee.

322
00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:56.999
Where did she get that ring?

323
00:20:57.069 --> 00:20:58.309
No idea.

324
00:20:58.569 --> 00:21:00.309
It didn't look cheap.

325
00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:03.309
I wanted to tell her to take it off...

326
00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:05.249
because it looked too old-fashioned.

327
00:21:05.878 --> 00:21:07.849
It doesn't match the clothes I gave her.

328
00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:09.978
She left it at home.

329
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.749
She was afraid she'll stand out at work.

330
00:21:13.749 --> 00:21:14.819
Aunt Sook Hee.

331
00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:17.529
You should stop by my shop later today.

332
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:20.158
I don't run errands.

333
00:21:20.728 --> 00:21:23.458
I prepared good quality wool and cashmere.

334
00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:24.829
You can go and choose one.

335
00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:26.468
You needed a half-coat, right?

336
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:33.509
Have some.

337
00:21:38.749 --> 00:21:40.509
It doesn't matter if it's categorized as...

338
00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:41.948
a developing area or for an urban restoration.

339
00:21:41.948 --> 00:21:44.249
People are bound to jump in to make money.

340
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:45.789
A lot of illegal things are done...

341
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:47.789
since money is involved in this business.

342
00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:50.118
I heard you have a painful personal story.

343
00:21:50.118 --> 00:21:52.259
Was that another motivating factor?

344
00:21:52.428 --> 00:21:55.458
Yes. I believe my dad was sacrificed because of...

345
00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:56.999
people who fought for their privileges.

346
00:21:59.198 --> 00:22:01.638
We're looking for any reports from people...

347
00:22:01.638 --> 00:22:03.739
who worked in the lab or anyone with information...

348
00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:05.339
about the apartment's building permit.

349
00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:09.908
I'm sure people will report after this show.

350
00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:11.478
Thank you.

351
00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:15.878
- Let's go. - Yes.

352
00:22:19.519 --> 00:22:21.059
I think these are from Chairman Park's side.

353
00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:22.059
Please check.

354
00:22:23.118 --> 00:22:25.628
And most of the reports won't be trustworthy.

355
00:22:25.628 --> 00:22:26.928
Make sure you filter them.

356
00:22:27.499 --> 00:22:28.499
Okay.

357
00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:05.398
(Danmi Jewelry)

358
00:23:15.408 --> 00:23:17.549
Can you make a ring that looks exactly like this?

359
00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:20.509
It has to be exactly the same.

360
00:23:21.618 --> 00:23:22.849
As soon as possible.

361
00:23:38.069 --> 00:23:40.099
Yes, they are the guys who help out my dad.

362
00:23:40.668 --> 00:23:42.099
Did they do something?

363
00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:44.269
This was taken right in front of my office.

364
00:23:45.138 --> 00:23:47.438
They followed Hae Ra and me into a market.

365
00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:50.009
I apologize on his behalf.

366
00:23:51.009 --> 00:23:52.609
This won't happen again.

367
00:23:53.178 --> 00:23:54.279
Mr. Park.

368
00:23:56.448 --> 00:23:59.289
Your dad has a scar on his right ankle, right?

369
00:24:01.918 --> 00:24:03.418
How do you know that?

370
00:24:03.418 --> 00:24:05.259
On the day of the fire at the lab,

371
00:24:05.259 --> 00:24:07.398
I fell down and held him by the ankle,

372
00:24:07.398 --> 00:24:08.529
asking him for help.

373
00:24:09.499 --> 00:24:11.868
I saw that scar as he abandoned me.

374
00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:16.168
I believe the construction company...

375
00:24:18.438 --> 00:24:20.739
paid him to set fire to the lab.

376
00:24:22.678 --> 00:24:25.049
My dad isn't that bold.

377
00:24:25.878 --> 00:24:28.079
He did it on purpose, knowing people were there.

378
00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:29.378
Mr. Moon.

379
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:35.059
You are stepping way over the line.

380
00:24:36.089 --> 00:24:37.859
I heard you had a bad case of inferiority complex.

381
00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:40.259
Among your friends, you're the least successful one.

382
00:24:45.428 --> 00:24:47.069
Don't blow this up,

383
00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:50.039
and tell him to come, kneel down, and apologize.

384
00:24:53.978 --> 00:24:55.239
He despises me,

385
00:24:56.978 --> 00:24:58.678
and I hate him too.

386
00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:03.118
But I still have to be on his side.

387
00:25:04.888 --> 00:25:06.648
I'll wait for an interesting story.

388
00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:23.438
We should go look in one more place.

389
00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:27.069
Where on earth are you going to find Jeom Bok?

390
00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:28.438
He was good at drawing.

391
00:25:28.438 --> 00:25:30.138
He's probably hiding in some place like this.

392
00:25:30.138 --> 00:25:31.948
You might as well put out an ad.

393
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:34.978
"Looking for Jeom Bok, alive since Joseon times."

394
00:25:34.978 --> 00:25:37.049
"The hint is that he draws well."

395
00:25:37.148 --> 00:25:38.618
Once we find him,

396
00:25:39.118 --> 00:25:41.089
something about us will change too.

397
00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:43.718
The letters on our arms might disappear.

398
00:25:44.458 --> 00:25:46.329
We'll be able to find an answer.

399
00:25:46.329 --> 00:25:47.499
How do you know?

400
00:25:48.499 --> 00:25:49.928
It's a gut feeling.

401
00:25:51.168 --> 00:25:53.569
Hae Ra has a silver ring.

402
00:25:53.569 --> 00:25:55.299
She got it from Soo Ho.

403
00:25:55.739 --> 00:25:57.868
I wonder where he got that from.

404
00:25:57.868 --> 00:25:59.309
It's not your ring.

405
00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:01.739
None of your business.

406
00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:04.178
The ring returned to its rightful owner,

407
00:26:04.178 --> 00:26:05.779
but the letters are still there.

408
00:26:06.478 --> 00:26:08.519
That means she's not the owner.

409
00:26:08.978 --> 00:26:09.978
If you...

410
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:13.989
covet after that ring, it'll be really bad.

411
00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:17.529
It's too hot to touch anyway.

412
00:26:18.158 --> 00:26:19.359
Don't worry.

413
00:26:21.428 --> 00:26:23.859
Jeom Bok tour, dismissed.

414
00:26:39.148 --> 00:26:40.249
Soo Ho already knows...

415
00:26:40.249 --> 00:26:41.849
that my dad made money...

416
00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:45.019
with Doctor Moon's research.

417
00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:48.888
I told him about the orphanage too.

418
00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:50.789
On the day of Doctor Moon's death,

419
00:26:51.928 --> 00:26:54.658
your dad was with him.

420
00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:57.299
I was there too.

421
00:26:57.868 --> 00:27:00.668
I pretended to help them while pocketing...

422
00:27:01.168 --> 00:27:04.309
things from their storage and sold them for money.

423
00:27:05.168 --> 00:27:07.309
That's my only crime.

424
00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:09.609
That day,

425
00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:12.408
I went to pocket some cotton swabs,

426
00:27:14.378 --> 00:27:15.978
and saw your dad there.

427
00:27:17.148 --> 00:27:19.789
They were in a huge fight.

428
00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:23.658
I was in the storage,

429
00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:25.759
then I heard a huge explosion,

430
00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:28.299
so I ran away.

431
00:27:30.999 --> 00:27:33.468
Did you think I would believe you?

432
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:35.868
He only sponsored Soo Ho...

433
00:27:36.198 --> 00:27:37.708
out of guilt.

434
00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:41.908
Of course, he had to find the original copy of...

435
00:27:41.908 --> 00:27:43.309
his dad's research.

436
00:27:44.148 --> 00:27:46.878
He probably wanted to look like a generous person.

437
00:27:46.878 --> 00:27:50.618
I have your dad's handwritten agreement too.

438
00:27:51.118 --> 00:27:52.819
It says he won't use the research...

439
00:27:52.819 --> 00:27:56.718
for his business without Doctor Moon's consent.

440
00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:01.999
But he betrayed his friend and...

441
00:28:04.128 --> 00:28:06.029
I don't care if you expose everything.

442
00:28:08.468 --> 00:28:10.868
I'm worried that Soo Ho might get hurt,

443
00:28:13.668 --> 00:28:15.279
but everything else is...

444
00:28:17.079 --> 00:28:19.079
for him to decide.

445
00:28:19.708 --> 00:28:22.978
You like him.

446
00:28:23.819 --> 00:28:24.819
Yes.

447
00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:26.648
I do.

448
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:29.259
Would he still like you...

449
00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:31.688
after finding out everything?

450
00:28:32.958 --> 00:28:34.628
Even if he ends up hating me,

451
00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:37.128
I can't help it.

452
00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:44.938
I'll be leaving, then.

453
00:28:45.468 --> 00:28:46.539
Hae Ra.

454
00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:49.378
In times like these, you usually ask,

455
00:28:49.378 --> 00:28:50.849
"What do you want from me?"

456
00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:54.579
What is it?

457
00:28:54.878 --> 00:28:57.688
Keep showing that lonely kid some love.

458
00:28:57.948 --> 00:29:01.489
And make him stop what he's doing now.

459
00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:04.489
Both the restoration and the reinvestigation.

460
00:29:04.759 --> 00:29:06.489
And it's for your dad's sake too.

461
00:29:06.859 --> 00:29:10.799
I want to hide my past of living as a petty thief.

462
00:29:11.898 --> 00:29:12.968
Mr. Park.

463
00:29:14.368 --> 00:29:15.569
Are you sure...

464
00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:19.269
that my dad had a natural burial?

465
00:29:20.309 --> 00:29:21.539
Of course.

466
00:29:46.398 --> 00:29:48.898
If you have any sorrows, leave them here.

467
00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:51.708
Please rest in peace with the rest of your family.

468
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:04.448
Did you find any other possessions?

469
00:30:05.218 --> 00:30:06.448
No, not yet.

470
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:07.918
What about the gender and age?

471
00:30:08.489 --> 00:30:10.728
They believe it's a man in his 40s.

472
00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:24.752
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E13 Black Knight "Don't You Touch My Ring"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

473
00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:35.079
Hae Ra.

474
00:30:36.749 --> 00:30:37.948
What brings you here?

475
00:30:38.749 --> 00:30:40.789
I came to talk to Chairman Park.

476
00:30:41.658 --> 00:30:42.658
I'll get going now.

477
00:30:43.418 --> 00:30:44.428
Wait.

478
00:30:45.128 --> 00:30:46.228
What did my dad say?

479
00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:49.158
It was nothing.

480
00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:51.128
It's okay. You can tell me.

481
00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:52.829
Gosh, it's cold.

482
00:30:58.668 --> 00:30:59.708
What's going on?

483
00:30:59.868 --> 00:31:01.009
It's nothing.

484
00:31:01.378 --> 00:31:03.079
I just had a meeting with Chairman Park.

485
00:31:03.408 --> 00:31:04.408
Why?

486
00:31:05.809 --> 00:31:07.378
Did you talk to your parents?

487
00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:10.249
Well, I can't get a hold of them.

488
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:12.349
I'll call them again later.

489
00:31:12.648 --> 00:31:13.648
Let me know.

490
00:31:21.099 --> 00:31:22.599
What was she talking about?

491
00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:26.069
She said she wanted to...

492
00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:28.069
wish them a happy new year.

493
00:31:28.739 --> 00:31:29.739
Why all of a sudden?

494
00:31:30.138 --> 00:31:31.168
I don't know.

495
00:31:31.309 --> 00:31:32.368
Let's go upstairs.

496
00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.609
Feel free to try these.

497
00:31:39.849 --> 00:31:41.478
Try this one.

498
00:31:56.428 --> 00:31:58.299
- Hello. - Welcome.

499
00:31:58.698 --> 00:32:00.599
You're the one who like the red bean bread.

500
00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:03.138
Yes, I'm the travel agent who came here before.

501
00:32:04.138 --> 00:32:06.009
Text messages sent from the web...

502
00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:07.478
can't be traced by the provider.

503
00:32:07.478 --> 00:32:09.438
Only the Cyber Police can trace it.

504
00:32:09.809 --> 00:32:12.648
But they do it only for fraud or blackmail.

505
00:32:12.648 --> 00:32:14.178
Maybe it was a prank.

506
00:32:14.178 --> 00:32:15.279
We'll leave it for now.

507
00:32:16.749 --> 00:32:18.549
It might not be a prank.

508
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:20.319
You should be prepare for that too.

509
00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:24.529
Let's go.

510
00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:25.759
Okay.

511
00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:31.228
I got a lot of calls from former lab researchers.

512
00:32:31.228 --> 00:32:33.599
They said they'd come and help anytime.

513
00:32:33.599 --> 00:32:34.968
I'm so grateful.

514
00:32:35.769 --> 00:32:37.069
A lot of people are on our side.

515
00:32:37.239 --> 00:32:38.239
Cheer up!

516
00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:44.249
(Hae Ra)

517
00:32:44.309 --> 00:32:45.849
(Soo Ho)

518
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:07.938
(Soo Ho)

519
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:25.789
Nari Trade will...

520
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:28.259
put the 300-person event up for a bid.

521
00:33:28.618 --> 00:33:30.559
They should just give it to us like usual.

522
00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.289
Why are they being abusive?

523
00:33:32.289 --> 00:33:34.158
We can get it.

524
00:33:34.158 --> 00:33:35.398
No!

525
00:33:35.398 --> 00:33:36.759
I just came out of a meeting.

526
00:33:36.898 --> 00:33:38.299
The idea is too old fashioned.

527
00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:41.099
Where's Hae Ra?

528
00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:49.609
It's been 10 minutes.

529
00:33:49.839 --> 00:33:51.349
I'm thinking.

530
00:33:52.478 --> 00:33:53.549
Hae Ra.

531
00:33:53.749 --> 00:33:56.319
You always come up with weird ideas.

532
00:33:56.749 --> 00:33:58.049
Why are you quiet today?

533
00:33:58.319 --> 00:34:00.888
I'm thinking really hard right now.

534
00:34:02.158 --> 00:34:03.519
Gosh. You're driving me crazy.

535
00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:05.428
Let me take a break.

536
00:34:05.958 --> 00:34:07.599
What? No, you can't. You didn't do anything.

537
00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:09.228
Come up with an idea. Then take a break.

538
00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:10.929
If you can't take care of this,

539
00:34:11.168 --> 00:34:12.168
you're fired.

540
00:34:12.898 --> 00:34:14.569
Come on.

541
00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:15.998
Go and take a break.

542
00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:18.308
Excuse me.

543
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:21.839
Hi, you're from the Blacksmith's.

544
00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:22.909
Hello.

545
00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:25.648
Mr. Moon sends you pastries.

546
00:34:25.648 --> 00:34:27.248
They just came out of the oven.

547
00:34:27.248 --> 00:34:28.279
They are seafood vegetable pastries.

548
00:34:28.279 --> 00:34:30.018
Try them. They're good.

549
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:36.619
Ju Hee.

550
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.759
Thanks, Chan Ki.

551
00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:44.498
Goodness.

552
00:34:45.529 --> 00:34:47.398
You've been busy, haven't you?

553
00:34:51.009 --> 00:34:53.239
Mr. Moon will drop by because he's nearby.

554
00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:54.609
Is he not busy?

555
00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:56.279
Why does he visit so often?

556
00:34:56.279 --> 00:34:58.208
- Hello. - Mr. Moon!

557
00:34:58.549 --> 00:34:59.949
Thanks for coming.

558
00:35:01.418 --> 00:35:02.719
Hi, Ms. Jung.

559
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:10.188
- Were you in a meeting? - Yes.

560
00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:13.688
Our client is making us enter a bid.

561
00:35:13.688 --> 00:35:15.759
So we're trying to come up with ideas.

562
00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:18.529
Hae Ra will be responsible for the bid.

563
00:35:22.139 --> 00:35:23.538
Why does she have to be responsible?

564
00:35:23.538 --> 00:35:25.308
She said she would.

565
00:35:25.308 --> 00:35:26.739
- When? - Earlier.

566
00:35:27.268 --> 00:35:29.878
- No, she didn't. - I'll make her.

567
00:35:30.308 --> 00:35:31.609
Goodness.

568
00:35:32.078 --> 00:35:33.109
Ms. Jung.

569
00:35:34.378 --> 00:35:36.078
I guess you like seafood vegetable bread.

570
00:35:36.779 --> 00:35:37.788
Pardon?

571
00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:41.319
I like it.

572
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:47.628
Seafood.

573
00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:50.359
Seafood.

574
00:35:50.799 --> 00:35:51.799
Yes, seafood.

575
00:35:52.998 --> 00:35:54.199
You and I need to talk, Chan Ki.

576
00:35:56.668 --> 00:35:57.739
I got it.

577
00:35:57.739 --> 00:35:59.808
- What? - Where?

578
00:35:59.808 --> 00:36:01.308
Oh, seafood.

579
00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:04.148
When the former chairman was taking refuge...

580
00:36:04.148 --> 00:36:06.648
in Busan, he had to eat sujebi all the time.

581
00:36:06.648 --> 00:36:08.949
So his mother worked at a harbor to get...

582
00:36:08.949 --> 00:36:12.248
octopus and fish to cook seafood sujebi.

583
00:36:12.248 --> 00:36:15.319
The whole family cried eating the seafood sujebi.

584
00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:16.589
It's a famous story.

585
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:17.929
Keep going.

586
00:36:22.299 --> 00:36:23.628
We'll hire the seafood sujebi chef...

587
00:36:23.628 --> 00:36:24.799
from Seongbuk-dong,

588
00:36:24.799 --> 00:36:26.569
and present a special menu.

589
00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:30.239
That's a great idea.

590
00:36:30.498 --> 00:36:33.869
We'll arrange it with the local hotel.

591
00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:37.808
And bring the ingredients from Korea.

592
00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:40.049
We'll offer them a sujebi feast for dinner.

593
00:36:40.049 --> 00:36:43.018
"Let's go together as one" will be the motto.

594
00:36:43.378 --> 00:36:44.949
- That's great. - I think it'll work.

595
00:36:44.949 --> 00:36:45.989
It's nice.

596
00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:54.659
She presented what I had in my head really well.

597
00:36:54.659 --> 00:36:56.159
Give her a round of applause.

598
00:36:58.098 --> 00:36:59.128
Hae Ra.

599
00:36:59.128 --> 00:37:00.839
- That's amazing. - Good job.

600
00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:02.299
- Your idea is awesome. - Great job, Hae Ra.

601
00:37:02.299 --> 00:37:03.938
- Good work. - Nice.

602
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:05.469
- Jung Hae Ra. - Jung Hae Ra.

603
00:37:20.248 --> 00:37:21.288
Thanks.

604
00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:24.159
Congratulations on getting applauded.

605
00:37:41.078 --> 00:37:42.078
Soo Ho.

606
00:37:42.938 --> 00:37:43.938
Yes?

607
00:37:45.748 --> 00:37:46.878
I love you.

608
00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:55.989
We'll do the rest at home.

609
00:38:01.098 --> 00:38:02.098
See you later.

610
00:38:02.699 --> 00:38:03.699
I'll see you at home.

611
00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:28.018
You're here.

612
00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:31.058
I came here...

613
00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:32.458
because I can't get a hold of you at home.

614
00:38:32.788 --> 00:38:34.458
I'm sorry. I had a lot of work to do.

615
00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:36.958
Thanks for the medicine this morning.

616
00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:38.699
I feel much better now.

617
00:38:42.538 --> 00:38:44.609
I agree with you.

618
00:38:44.609 --> 00:38:46.308
There's a reason why people are...

619
00:38:46.308 --> 00:38:47.909
crazy about retro movement.

620
00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:49.378
I want Geumseong-dong...

621
00:38:49.378 --> 00:38:51.478
to remain as an old neighborhood.

622
00:38:53.779 --> 00:38:56.049
Aren't you uncomfortable at my house?

623
00:38:56.648 --> 00:38:58.918
No. I'm having fun.

624
00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:00.348
I'm relieved.

625
00:39:00.549 --> 00:39:01.958
Do you like japchae?

626
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:03.518
I'll make it for dinner tonight.

627
00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:05.859
Sure.

628
00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:07.159
That's good to hear.

629
00:39:07.159 --> 00:39:08.429
Come home early.

630
00:39:08.558 --> 00:39:10.259
Okay. I'll see you at home.

631
00:39:12.828 --> 00:39:13.828
Oh, right.

632
00:39:14.869 --> 00:39:17.168
I'm not sure if this will be helpful,

633
00:39:19.268 --> 00:39:20.538
but I saw someone...

634
00:39:20.538 --> 00:39:22.438
on the night the lab was on fire.

635
00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:26.109
I didn't find him strange...

636
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:28.378
because he looked like a gentleman.

637
00:39:28.779 --> 00:39:30.688
But he wasn't from the lab.

638
00:39:30.918 --> 00:39:33.589
I remembered it recently...

639
00:39:34.058 --> 00:39:35.458
after seeing a picture.

640
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:36.759
What picture?

641
00:39:37.288 --> 00:39:39.659
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

642
00:39:40.799 --> 00:39:42.458
I saw someone...

643
00:39:42.659 --> 00:39:44.628
who looked kind of similar.

644
00:39:47.938 --> 00:39:50.438
I saw him in Hae Ra's family picture.

645
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:54.538
I remember him being tall and wearing glasses.

646
00:39:58.248 --> 00:39:59.308
Do you remember this picture?

647
00:39:59.308 --> 00:40:00.578
It was during Chuseok.

648
00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:06.418
You might have seen the same person.

649
00:40:07.188 --> 00:40:09.089
He used to visit the lab often.

650
00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:10.659
I guess he visited the lab...

651
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:11.859
on the day it was on fire too.

652
00:40:12.558 --> 00:40:14.359
He seemed angry when he entered the lab.

653
00:40:20.299 --> 00:40:22.369
Please don't say that to Hae Ra.

654
00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:26.509
Sure. I'll see you at home.

655
00:40:33.248 --> 00:40:34.878
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

656
00:40:34.878 --> 00:40:36.518
Goodbye, Chan Ki.

657
00:40:59.768 --> 00:41:01.038
It's strange.

658
00:41:06.049 --> 00:41:07.878
I'm sure I left it here.

659
00:41:12.018 --> 00:41:13.089
Aunt Sook Hee.

660
00:41:13.518 --> 00:41:14.619
Aunt Sook Hee.

661
00:41:16.159 --> 00:41:17.188
What?

662
00:41:17.529 --> 00:41:19.328
Have you seen my ring here?

663
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:20.659
I haven't.

664
00:41:21.098 --> 00:41:23.199
I've never come in your room today.

665
00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:24.768
I was in the tailor shop.

666
00:41:25.168 --> 00:41:26.168
What for?

667
00:41:26.168 --> 00:41:28.839
She told me to choose a fabric for my new coat.

668
00:41:31.339 --> 00:41:33.168
Where did it go then?

669
00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:36.378
Did it disappear?

670
00:41:37.409 --> 00:41:38.478
Yes.

671
00:41:38.478 --> 00:41:40.648
I put it here for sure, and it's gone.

672
00:41:41.549 --> 00:41:42.719
It's strange.

673
00:41:44.049 --> 00:41:45.889
I told Sharon...

674
00:41:45.889 --> 00:41:48.619
that you forgot to wear your ring.

675
00:42:06.569 --> 00:42:07.609
Well...

676
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:11.009
I'm sorry to ask you this question.

677
00:42:11.748 --> 00:42:12.808
What is it?

678
00:42:13.708 --> 00:42:15.949
Have you seen my ring by any chance?

679
00:42:18.688 --> 00:42:21.119
I put it in my jewelry box, and it's gone.

680
00:42:21.759 --> 00:42:24.628
Oh, I took it.

681
00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:26.688
Why?

682
00:42:26.688 --> 00:42:29.098
It looked rare, but a little tainted.

683
00:42:29.728 --> 00:42:31.569
I wanted to clean it for you.

684
00:42:34.869 --> 00:42:37.098
You don't need to do that next time.

685
00:42:38.969 --> 00:42:40.109
Give it back to me right now.

686
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:42.438
They can clean cheap rings on the spot,

687
00:42:42.438 --> 00:42:44.409
but it takes a few days to clean expensive rings.

688
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:46.449
I'll get it back for you, so don't worry.

689
00:42:48.518 --> 00:42:49.719
Do you like japchae?

690
00:42:49.848 --> 00:42:51.288
It's delicious.

691
00:42:57.628 --> 00:42:59.128
Go get it right now.

692
00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:02.359
I want...

693
00:43:03.058 --> 00:43:04.369
that ring back right now.

694
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:10.639
The store must be closed at this hour.

695
00:43:19.308 --> 00:43:21.518
Why did you touch my stuff without permission?

696
00:43:22.449 --> 00:43:23.719
You know I got it as a gift...

697
00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:25.549
and its meaning too.

698
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:27.688
So how could you take that without my permission?

699
00:43:29.918 --> 00:43:31.958
I did it as a favor.

700
00:43:32.058 --> 00:43:33.558
You bought me strawberries...

701
00:43:33.558 --> 00:43:34.859
and were good to me.

702
00:43:34.859 --> 00:43:36.699
Then you should've paid me back with strawberries.

703
00:43:36.699 --> 00:43:38.869
Why did you have to take my ring?

704
00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:40.699
You know what it means to me.

705
00:43:40.739 --> 00:43:42.098
What does it mean to you?

706
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:44.969
It's a ring I got from my lover.

707
00:43:50.509 --> 00:43:51.679
What's going on?

708
00:43:59.418 --> 00:44:02.659
Sharon, you're at fault in this.

709
00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:05.859
It's rude to take someone else's ring.

710
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:08.598
I didn't steal it.

711
00:44:08.598 --> 00:44:10.728
I only meant to clean it for her.

712
00:44:10.728 --> 00:44:13.969
Still, it's right to ask for her permission first.

713
00:44:13.969 --> 00:44:16.969
And the ring has its glamor the way it is.

714
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:18.869
I hate it if you have to polish it unnaturally.

715
00:44:18.869 --> 00:44:19.909
Okay.

716
00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:22.109
I'll tell them not to clean it.

717
00:44:22.739 --> 00:44:24.148
Give me the store's number.

718
00:44:24.279 --> 00:44:25.679
I'll go get it right now.

719
00:44:25.679 --> 00:44:27.179
What's wrong with you?

720
00:44:28.418 --> 00:44:29.779
Are you doing this on purpose?

721
00:44:29.779 --> 00:44:30.889
Hae Ra, that's enough.

722
00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:32.648
I'll go get it tomorrow.

723
00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:37.188
Why did you come in my room in the first place?

724
00:44:37.188 --> 00:44:39.389
How could you take my ring without permission...

725
00:44:39.389 --> 00:44:41.128
and leave it to the store for cleaning?

726
00:44:41.128 --> 00:44:43.659
You know I want to dress you up nicely.

727
00:44:43.659 --> 00:44:44.768
Forget it.

728
00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:46.998
Give me the number now.

729
00:44:46.998 --> 00:44:48.768
Stop it and go in your room.

730
00:44:48.768 --> 00:44:50.239
- Aunt Sook Hee. - Okay.

731
00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:52.308
- Go to your room. - He's right, Hae Ra.

732
00:44:52.308 --> 00:44:55.938
Calm down now. Let's go to your room.

733
00:44:56.478 --> 00:44:57.808
Calm down, Hae Ra.

734
00:44:57.808 --> 00:44:59.578
- Goodness. - I know.

735
00:45:01.819 --> 00:45:03.418
You should calm down too, Seo Rin.

736
00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:12.659
She's absolutely at fault on this,

737
00:45:12.659 --> 00:45:14.898
but you've gotten so worked up.

738
00:45:15.299 --> 00:45:17.569
I really don't understand her.

739
00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:19.628
Drink some water and calm down.

740
00:45:19.628 --> 00:45:21.069
I'll go get you some water.

741
00:45:35.648 --> 00:45:38.918
You take all my clothes without any complaints,

742
00:45:38.918 --> 00:45:40.659
but why are you so worked up with that ring?

743
00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:42.458
Are you protesting on purpose?

744
00:45:43.089 --> 00:45:44.159
What?

745
00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:46.259
Are you gone too proud because I dressed up...

746
00:45:46.259 --> 00:45:48.659
a beggar like you and for staying at a fancy house?

747
00:45:49.429 --> 00:45:52.029
You think it suits you to be treated as a princess?

748
00:46:04.409 --> 00:46:06.148
Let me go!

749
00:46:11.918 --> 00:46:12.949
You...

750
00:46:27.438 --> 00:46:28.668
Let go.

751
00:46:34.938 --> 00:46:36.208
Your father...

752
00:46:36.708 --> 00:46:38.748
was there when the lab caught on fire.

753
00:46:39.348 --> 00:46:42.148
I saw him enter the lab with a mad face.

754
00:46:45.788 --> 00:46:47.489
Shall I go report this to the police?

755
00:46:48.089 --> 00:46:49.759
Or should I post it on the internet?

756
00:47:06.438 --> 00:47:07.639
Are you okay?

757
00:47:12.509 --> 00:47:13.609
Let's go out.

758
00:47:36.098 --> 00:47:39.009
I was making japchae for our dinner.

759
00:47:40.808 --> 00:47:41.878
It's upsetting.

760
00:47:43.938 --> 00:47:45.478
Where did you leave the ring?

761
00:47:46.279 --> 00:47:47.819
I'll go get it now.

762
00:47:48.279 --> 00:47:50.018
It's closed at this hour.

763
00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:52.348
I'll get it tomorrow or the day after.

764
00:47:52.348 --> 00:47:53.489
Don't worry.

765
00:47:58.128 --> 00:48:00.489
It was thoughtless of you.

766
00:48:03.228 --> 00:48:04.768
I'll reserve you a five-star hotel.

767
00:48:05.998 --> 00:48:08.239
I'll let you stay there from next week.

768
00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:19.878
With the ring he gave you,

769
00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:23.648
I'll kill you.

770
00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:38.029
Don't cry. It's not that you lost it.

771
00:48:41.538 --> 00:48:43.869
I told her to stay at a hotel from next week.

772
00:48:46.268 --> 00:48:47.708
No, I'll move out.

773
00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:51.208
You need her for your business.

774
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:53.848
I need you for my life.

775
00:49:13.199 --> 00:49:14.239
Soo Ho.

776
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:16.369
Yes?

777
00:49:17.938 --> 00:49:19.639
Can I ask you out for a date?

778
00:49:47.938 --> 00:49:49.639
It reminds me of the winter break.

779
00:49:50.969 --> 00:49:53.708
It reminds me of doing your vacation homework.

780
00:49:54.538 --> 00:49:56.739
What do you mean? I don't remember any of it.

781
00:50:01.848 --> 00:50:04.418
There. Let's go.

782
00:50:05.319 --> 00:50:06.819
- Stand up slowly. - Let's go.

783
00:50:10.389 --> 00:50:11.558
Goodness.

784
00:50:11.558 --> 00:50:13.529
One step at a time.

785
00:50:13.958 --> 00:50:15.828
My gosh, I almost fell.

786
00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:19.498
Wait for me.

787
00:50:19.498 --> 00:50:20.938
- Go! - Where are you going?

788
00:50:20.969 --> 00:50:22.739
Don't leave me here.

789
00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:28.478
- Left foot. - Be careful.

790
00:50:28.478 --> 00:50:30.109
- Right foot. - Oh, my gosh.

791
00:50:32.609 --> 00:50:35.179
Do you know when I was the happiest to tutor you?

792
00:50:36.179 --> 00:50:37.179
I don't know.

793
00:50:37.179 --> 00:50:39.248
When you scored 52 points on your math test.

794
00:50:40.759 --> 00:50:41.819
Hey.

795
00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:42.989
I was so happy.

796
00:50:42.989 --> 00:50:45.188
I knew I could bring it up a lot.

797
00:50:46.228 --> 00:50:47.898
Please forget my dark and black history.

798
00:50:48.728 --> 00:50:50.668
But don't forget your black knight.

799
00:50:58.909 --> 00:50:59.969
I have a present for you.

800
00:51:00.978 --> 00:51:03.578
This is very precious and expensive,

801
00:51:04.378 --> 00:51:06.109
so take it with two hands.

802
00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:07.449
Okay.

803
00:51:10.148 --> 00:51:11.148
Fine.

804
00:51:18.188 --> 00:51:19.188
What is this?

805
00:51:28.498 --> 00:51:30.598
That's your uniform jacket you left at my house.

806
00:51:31.469 --> 00:51:32.969
I was going to show you...

807
00:51:32.969 --> 00:51:34.239
when I see you again,

808
00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:35.978
but you disappeared without a word.

809
00:51:36.839 --> 00:51:38.509
Why did you take a picture in this?

810
00:51:38.609 --> 00:51:40.049
Why do you think so?

811
00:51:42.319 --> 00:51:43.619
This picture is...

812
00:51:44.788 --> 00:51:45.989
like my diary.

813
00:51:47.918 --> 00:51:49.589
I was going to start wearing that...

814
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:51.859
once I grew into it.

815
00:51:51.859 --> 00:51:53.759
But when our family went bankrupt,

816
00:51:53.759 --> 00:51:55.299
I lost it when we moved.

817
00:51:58.168 --> 00:51:59.628
Do you want to see my diary too?

818
00:52:09.239 --> 00:52:10.438
Can you read it?

819
00:52:14.179 --> 00:52:15.348
I'm reading it.

820
00:52:15.878 --> 00:52:18.719
If you read the entry from Christmas two years ago,

821
00:52:19.049 --> 00:52:20.418
it'll surely make you cry.

822
00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:25.489
What's that?

823
00:52:26.529 --> 00:52:28.529
Kiss? You want to kiss?

824
00:52:29.859 --> 00:52:31.069
That's last night's entry.

825
00:52:42.208 --> 00:52:45.179
(Blacksmith's)

826
00:52:45.679 --> 00:52:48.679
We're going to work on frontal shoulder muscles.

827
00:52:48.679 --> 00:52:49.679
One.

828
00:52:50.688 --> 00:52:52.589
Two. The point is...

829
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:54.418
to not put any pressure on your trapezius.

830
00:52:54.958 --> 00:52:56.458
We'll work up to 50.

831
00:52:56.989 --> 00:52:58.389
Don't use your trapezius.

832
00:53:02.058 --> 00:53:05.498
Mr. Moon and Mr. Han must be very busy.

833
00:53:05.998 --> 00:53:08.469
Yes, they're always busy.

834
00:53:09.498 --> 00:53:10.498
Why?

835
00:53:13.268 --> 00:53:16.409
They have to check all the incoming reports,

836
00:53:16.639 --> 00:53:18.078
and Geumseong 1-dong and Geumseong 2-dong...

837
00:53:18.078 --> 00:53:20.348
will soon be designated as a demo restoration area.

838
00:53:20.509 --> 00:53:21.779
They have a lot on their hands.

839
00:53:22.378 --> 00:53:23.949
I see.

840
00:53:32.929 --> 00:53:34.799
You must be Mr. Yoon Dal Hong.

841
00:53:34.859 --> 00:53:38.569
I'm here to see Mr. Moon.

842
00:53:38.898 --> 00:53:41.598
He's at the City Hall in a meeting.

843
00:53:41.739 --> 00:53:43.839
I'll let him know that you stopped by.

844
00:53:44.808 --> 00:53:47.938
Please let him know that this is important.

845
00:53:48.438 --> 00:53:49.438
Of course.

846
00:54:00.219 --> 00:54:02.859
He came really early. It was before 9am.

847
00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:06.058
He did go back...

848
00:54:06.058 --> 00:54:07.498
because Mr. Moon wasn't there.

849
00:54:07.799 --> 00:54:10.828
Does he think he's in bad luck for betraying him?

850
00:54:11.029 --> 00:54:12.069
Why was he there?

851
00:54:12.268 --> 00:54:15.098
"Please let him know that this is important."

852
00:54:16.098 --> 00:54:17.409
He said that and left.

853
00:54:18.639 --> 00:54:20.139
I have your coffee.

854
00:54:23.578 --> 00:54:24.578
Thanks.

855
00:54:42.458 --> 00:54:43.598
I knew it.

856
00:54:44.628 --> 00:54:46.498
You're the best.

857
00:54:47.799 --> 00:54:49.299
Here's the real one.

858
00:54:58.549 --> 00:55:00.978
Melt this ring, and make a new blade for this.

859
00:55:02.478 --> 00:55:05.288
It's not something that should be melted.

860
00:55:05.949 --> 00:55:07.819
Make me the knife of three tigers.

861
00:55:08.458 --> 00:55:10.319
The knife of three tigers?

862
00:55:11.659 --> 00:55:14.228
On the tiger's month, day, and hour,

863
00:55:15.498 --> 00:55:18.569
make a knife that is extremely hard and sharp.

864
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:32.748
Everyone, let's go get lunch.

865
00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:37.288
What's this? Hae Ra, is this yours?

866
00:55:37.819 --> 00:55:38.819
Yes.

867
00:55:39.418 --> 00:55:40.449
Are you going somewhere?

868
00:55:40.788 --> 00:55:42.958
No, I need to get it fixed.

869
00:55:42.958 --> 00:55:45.188
I see. Let's go eat lunch.

870
00:55:45.389 --> 00:55:46.589
I'll buy sandwiches.

871
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:47.598
Okay!

872
00:55:55.898 --> 00:55:57.469
I'd like it toasted.

873
00:55:58.538 --> 00:55:59.668
- Thank you. - You're the best.

874
00:55:59.668 --> 00:56:00.938
Sure.

875
00:56:00.938 --> 00:56:02.378
This is good.

876
00:56:03.078 --> 00:56:04.679
You know that bakery in our neighborhood?

877
00:56:04.949 --> 00:56:06.478
Their sales are soaring.

878
00:56:06.648 --> 00:56:08.049
That's awesome.

879
00:56:08.049 --> 00:56:09.319
The entire neighborhood can get revived...

880
00:56:09.319 --> 00:56:10.889
with one successful business in the area.

881
00:56:10.889 --> 00:56:12.418
Exactly.

882
00:56:12.418 --> 00:56:14.288
- So let's keep it up. - Okay.

883
00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:15.659
Let's go!

884
00:56:15.659 --> 00:56:17.889
- Go! - That was too small.

885
00:56:17.929 --> 00:56:19.058
I'm sorry.

886
00:56:25.569 --> 00:56:26.898
I did something very shameful...

887
00:56:27.268 --> 00:56:28.799
because of my greed.

888
00:56:30.239 --> 00:56:31.869
I'm not here to trick you.

889
00:56:32.239 --> 00:56:33.268
They're asking for cancellation fee...

890
00:56:33.268 --> 00:56:34.378
that's three times the contraction fee.

891
00:56:34.509 --> 00:56:36.009
I'll take care of that.

892
00:56:36.609 --> 00:56:38.078
Please give me one week.

893
00:56:39.449 --> 00:56:40.679
Goodbye.

894
00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:46.319
Right.

895
00:56:46.949 --> 00:56:49.788
Is your father Doctor Moon?

896
00:56:51.728 --> 00:56:53.089
Do you know him?

897
00:56:55.128 --> 00:56:57.569
I saw that on the TV show you were on.

898
00:56:58.268 --> 00:56:59.969
He was a good man.

899
00:57:03.299 --> 00:57:06.369
I'm not saying that I knew him personally.

900
00:57:06.609 --> 00:57:09.609
I've read a few articles on the newspaper.

901
00:57:10.308 --> 00:57:11.578
I'll call you later.

902
00:57:11.708 --> 00:57:12.779
Sir.

903
00:57:17.748 --> 00:57:19.589
I think you have something more to say.

904
00:57:22.659 --> 00:57:25.029
Either you say it now, or we find out ourselves.

905
00:57:25.328 --> 00:57:26.558
Which do you prefer?

906
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:28.529
I don't have anything to say.

907
00:57:29.259 --> 00:57:32.128
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

908
00:57:33.098 --> 00:57:34.598
I'll call you later.

909
00:57:44.308 --> 00:57:45.378
That was odd.

910
00:57:45.779 --> 00:57:47.648
Get a certified copy of register.

911
00:57:47.648 --> 00:57:49.619
Find out exactly when he purchased his properties.

912
00:57:50.078 --> 00:57:51.089
Yes, sir.

913
00:57:51.619 --> 00:57:53.918
Let's head one last time to the construction site.

914
00:57:54.518 --> 00:57:55.918
Are we going there again?

915
00:57:55.918 --> 00:57:57.828
I want to go and pray at least until today.

916
00:57:58.788 --> 00:57:59.788
Yes, sir.

917
00:58:07.768 --> 00:58:09.299
We stood around and bowed down...

918
00:58:09.299 --> 00:58:10.938
before we got started today too.

919
00:58:11.339 --> 00:58:12.839
- Great job. - Sure.

920
00:58:13.768 --> 00:58:14.978
Captain, over here.

921
00:58:18.208 --> 00:58:19.378
I found something weird.

922
00:58:26.848 --> 00:58:28.389
I found this too.

923
00:58:36.859 --> 00:58:39.369
It looks like a piece of cloth label.

924
00:58:49.179 --> 00:58:51.348
(Moon Soo Ho)

925
00:58:56.819 --> 00:58:58.089
Give that to the police.

926
00:58:59.748 --> 00:59:00.859
Yes, sir.

927
00:59:16.339 --> 00:59:17.708
Hae Ra, are you home?

928
00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:20.909
Hae Ra.

929
01:00:06.188 --> 01:00:07.359
Hae Ra.

930
01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:42.159
(Black Knight)

931
01:00:42.558 --> 01:00:44.328
Their desperate hearts...

932
01:00:44.328 --> 01:00:46.029
brought them luck.

933
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:47.958
If one of them closes his or her mind,

934
01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.759
everything will be over.

935
01:00:49.759 --> 01:00:52.228
Finally everything is going back to its place.

936
01:00:52.228 --> 01:00:53.668
It seems like Hae Ra left your house.

937
01:00:53.668 --> 01:00:55.069
Is she well?

938
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:56.538
Did she call you?

939
01:00:56.538 --> 01:00:59.609
I guess you have strange, evil power.

940
01:00:59.609 --> 01:01:01.279
Then you'll die soon too.

941
01:01:01.279 --> 01:01:03.708
You were my husband in my past life.

942
01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:04.708
Do you want to hug me?

943
01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:06.779
You will remember me.

944
01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:09.348
You have to give me your unfinished love!

945
01:01:09.348 --> 01:01:12.219
You disappeared without any explanations.

946
01:01:12.219 --> 01:01:13.688
I don't like that.

947
01:01:13.688 --> 01:01:15.589
Didn't you ask to never break up?

948
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:16.688
It was you.
