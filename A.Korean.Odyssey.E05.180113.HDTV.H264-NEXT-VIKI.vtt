00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.620 line:93%
<i>[Episode 5]</i>

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.830 line:93%
<i>President Woo Hwi of Lucifer Entertainment 1930s Record Film Donation</i>

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.340 line:93%
Yes.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.080 line:93%
Oh, thank you.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.910 line:93%
Thank you.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.540 line:93%
The 1930's record film you donated will become a

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.250 line:93%
priceless legacy.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.430 line:93%
You did something great.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.000 line:93%
It was no big deal.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.100 line:93%
It was a big deal.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.570 line:93%
In order to retrieve that film from Heidelberg University in Germany, he traveled five times

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.700 line:93%
and donated one million dollars.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.390 line:93%
When you display the film, we ask that you please place a write-up of all his efforts with it.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.890 line:93%
- What do you mean?
- A great deed must be known.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.430 line:93%
When we host the film screening, we plan on extensively announcing all your achievements.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.720 line:93%
Aigoo, there is no need to do that...

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.290 line:93%
Also, from the Ministry of Culture,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.380 line:93%
I heard that you will be receiving the presidential medal

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.000 line:93%
for cultural artist award.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.130 line:93%
The presidential medal?

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.580 line:93%
Oh, well they didn't have to do such...

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.590 line:93%
This kind of good deed is another way for me to become a god.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.670 line:93%
There is nothing to be impressed about receiving an award from a human,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.130 line:93%
but it feels good to show off, so it's not so bad.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.470 line:93%
I will spread around the article extensively so that there will be many opportunities for you to boast freely.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.510 line:93%
They said the medal ceremony will be televised live, right?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.900 line:93%
I better get a new outfit made. I have nothing to wear next week.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.070 line:93%
Excuse me. We will pass by.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.060 line:93%
There are interesting things at a museum.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.400 line:93%
Among the old items, there are ones which the owners' souls are attached to.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.130 line:93%
Be careful! This sword belonged to a general who saved this nation.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.690 line:93%
It seems like the owner of that sword is a remarkable person.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.140 line:93%
The one who saved the country. It's her.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.240 line:93%
The one who used that sword to save the nation is that woman,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.310 line:93%
but it seems people are mistaken about the general.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.220 line:93%
If they find out it's an unknown woman's sword instead of an honorable general's sword,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.860 line:93%
they wouldn't cherish it that way.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.810 line:93%
Among the preciously displayed objects in this place

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.040 line:93%
many probably hold different truths than what has been known.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.240 line:93%
<i>[A Beautiful Donation]</i>

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.450 line:93%
Some could hold hideous secrets perhaps.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.580 line:93%
Is this the motel where strange things happen?

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.910 line:93%
Yes. There's been many strange rumors, so customers have stopped coming.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.360 line:93%
The owner got scared and wants to sell it as fast as possible, so he's asking for half the market value.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.300 line:93%
Let's go in.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.460 line:93%
Woah. The bathtub is extremely big.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.690 line:93%
What do you mean by strange rumors?

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.930 line:93%
Well, first of all, this is a motel, you know?

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.510 line:93%
So what it is is the kind of bling-bling, you know,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.130 line:93%
so when couples are in the midst of their love-love business

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.530 line:93%
they say something strange just pops out all of sudden and ruins it all.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.080 line:93%
It doesn't make sense right? They should go to the hospital or eat some eel instead. <i>(believed to be an aphrodisiac)</i>

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.160 line:93%
They're only making excuses because they're lacking, seriously.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.020 line:93%
It seems like there isn't anything especially odd.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.050 line:93%
There is something. Who is that?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.990 line:93%
Wow, this is great! Wow.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.700 line:93%
The room is nice and warm. Oh, this is totally my style.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.360 line:93%
Why does that guy keep following us wherever we work these days?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.450 line:93%
That guy,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.730 line:93%
That guy is the one who was at your house that time, right?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.910 line:93%
- The one who told me to get lost.
- Look at this style.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.240 line:93%
Don't worry about him. He's someone who protects me... kind of.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.780 line:93%
Guard? He's a guard?

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.310 line:93%
The Entertainment Company already gave you a personal bodyguard?

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.720 line:93%
Well, it's something like that.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.390 line:93%
It's not like you're even the least bit famous but already giving you a bodyguard.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.460 line:93%
Lucifer Entertainment... Wow, it's the jackpot!

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.990 line:93%
Giving you a bodyguard already... Wow, Lucifer Entertainment.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.210 line:93%
Woah. Jackpot!

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.140 line:93%
It even has this sort of thing? Wow, this is totally state-of-the-art.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.930 line:93%
CEO, but just because you're not popular yet,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.450 line:93%
I think they assigned you a person who's lacking something, too. He's a bit...

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.250 line:93%
- Weird right?
- Yes.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.820 line:93%
But, he can hear even if we whisper so we can't badmouth him.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.030 line:93%
If we badmouth him, we'll be in trouble.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.830 line:93%
Okay.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.790 line:93%
Oh, you're here? Alright, just a minute.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.060 line:93%
The building owner came with the key to the rooftop. I'll go get it.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.280 line:93%
Seriously.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.590 line:93%
Son Oh Gong, there seems to be an evil spirit in here right?

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.110 line:93%
I'm not sure. But this room is really great.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.610 line:93%
The bed's big. The bathtub's big. I want to live in a room like this.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.290 line:93%
- This isn't a room you can live in.
- I can't live here?

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.770 line:93%
Then, what do you do here?

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.820 line:93%
That's enough. Knock it off with the embarrassing talk and find the evil spirit already.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.710 line:93%
Why? What's wrong? This room has a way bigger TV than your house.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.950 line:93%
Do you want to watch a movie with me tonight?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.180 line:93%
Oh! Wow, they even deliver chicken. I really like chicken!
<i>[Fried Chicken]</i>

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.650 line:93%
So a place like this existed in this world. I should sleep here before I go.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.980 line:93%
- What?
- Who do you think you're trying to fool with the innocent act?

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.050 line:93%
Aren't you embarrassed of lying while looking at me straight in the face?

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.510 line:93%
I am embarrassed. You think I wouldn't be?

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.720 line:93%
But what can I do? Since I love you.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.520 line:93%
That's what love is like. So what if I get a little embarrassed?

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.010 line:93%
When today, I could even sleep with you here.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.660 line:93%
I'm embarrassed of your love talk.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.070 line:93%
Right... I should love you...

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.580 line:93%
What's happening?

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.100 line:93%
What are you doing? Making my heart flutter...

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.470 line:93%
You heard earlier. We have to "love-love" for the evil spirit to appear.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.720 line:93%
Oh, "love-love"

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.700 line:93%
That's a good idea, but I don't think this is enough to make it appear.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.560 line:93%
- When it appears, you catch it right away.
- Okay.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.720 line:93%
But, you know, if it still doesn't appear, what should we do?

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.770 line:93%
Well, in that case...

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.750 line:93%
U-um, in that case...

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.900 line:93%
Then...

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.670 line:93%
Hold on.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.690 line:93%
Why, you! No manners whatsoever!

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.340 line:93%
- You caught it?
- Yeah. But I don't think there's just one.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.680 line:93%
Let's hurry and keep going.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.370 line:93%
You know there's only one! Don't try any funny business!

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.250 line:93%
Agh, that damned evil spirit. Seriously...

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.930 line:93%
But why was that evil spirit attracted to this place?

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.260 line:93%
Huh?
<i>Fried Chicken</i>

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.330 line:93%
It was attracted to a truly filthy wickedness that exists here.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:43.080 line:93%
A filthy desire to watch people in secret and the obscene greed to make money off of it.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.590 line:93%
There was something like this in the room.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.560 line:93%
This must be something a person set up, right?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.520 line:93%
Of course.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.450 line:93%
CEO.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.530 line:93%
The owner says he's available to sign a contract right away.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.230 line:93%
Hello. Who will I be doing a contract with...

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.400 line:93%
Ah, damn it...

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.160 line:93%
- Catch that person!
- Pardon?

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.690 line:93%
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Why, why, why?!

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.360 line:93%
Sir! Sir!

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.830 line:93%
Oh my god! Oh my god!

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.070 line:93%
Are you all right?

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.900 line:93%
Turns out we caught both an evil spirit and an evil person today.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.750 line:93%
If we keep digging up one after another like this, we should be able to prevent the evil events I see.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.080 line:93%
Don't you think so too, Son Oh Gong?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.350 line:93%
Whether this world breaks apart or blows up, it has nothing to do with me.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.320 line:93%
I just need to protect you because I love you.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.200 line:93%
I'm thankful.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.070 line:93%
But still, this world I love shouldn't get destroyed.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.880 line:93%
What you love isn't important.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.790 line:93%
The only thing that's important is that I love you.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:23.690 line:93%
That's right. No matter how I feel, the only person in love is you.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.560 line:93%
I'm going to go home, so you can leave.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.420 line:93%
Let's go together. I like going with you.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.300 line:93%
Because you love me?

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.160 line:93%
Then I guess there's nothing I can do.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.390 line:93%
What do you mean? Why?

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.820 line:93%
The air's nice for once, and the band I like released a new song.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.820 line:93%
I wanted to go for a walk by myself while listening to it.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.970 line:93%
When going for a walk in a good mood while listening to good music and breathing in good air,

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.220 line:93%
Me being next to you should make it even better, no?

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.090 line:93%
I guess it's not.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.480 line:93%
The only person in love is you. I'm not in love.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.990 line:93%
But you know I'm not in love because I want to be.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.850 line:93%
Okay, I get it. Come with me then.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.900 line:93%
- Go by yourself.
- You can come with me.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.060 line:93%
Never mind, go.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.120 line:93%
Hurry and go!

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.500 line:93%
Okay.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.460 line:93%
<i>I'll be done, and you'll be alone again.</i>

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.920 line:93%
I have to come to my senses.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.720 line:93%
Is this it?

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.730 line:93%
What the...

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.570 line:93%
What is this?

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.940 line:93%
Do you want to know who I am?

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.950 line:93%
You're a Japanese kid? How did you get in? Who are you?!

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.540 line:93%
Nobody must know who I am.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:28.190 line:93%
Don't come near me. Stay away!

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.420 line:93%
What the...

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.130 line:93%
Damn it!

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.350 line:93%
Who was that kid earlier?

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.710 line:93%
She's not coming, right?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.900 line:93%
The news about you receiving the presidential medal made the main page of the web portal.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.690 line:93%
Ah, is that so? Let's see...

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.250 line:93%
They should've used a good picture of me...

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.690 line:93%
Should I post in the group chat that you'll be receiving the medal?

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:46.510 line:93%
When it's on the front page of the site like this, I'm sure everyone's seen it. It's fine.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.170 line:93%
You worked hard.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.190 line:93%
Oh, Chairman.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.960 line:93%
These packages just arrived. Why don't you take them with you?

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960 line:93%
Ah, yes, of course.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:14.640 line:93%
Huh? These are Jin Bu Ja's again. That girl is in a home shopping craze these days. What's with all these?

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:21.120 line:93%
It's another day that you have a lot of outside visitors.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.670 line:93%
Any visitor who parks

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.660 line:93%
needs to get a parking sticker first. Please be aware from now on.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.670 line:93%
Yes, I understand. But it seems like there are a lot of visitors today?

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.640 line:93%
Yes, as you can see.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.950 line:93%
By the way, I saw the article about you.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.180 line:93%
You mean the presidential medal?

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:48.400 line:93%
That's why all your acquaintances must have come to hold a party to congratulate you.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.280 line:93%
Just what is so great about a presidential medal? They are making such a fuss!

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.060 line:93%
Aigoo, congratulations!

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.270 line:93%
♪ Always by your side...

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.780 line:93%
These darn people are really-The presidential medal...

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.640 line:93%
The presidential medal.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.700 line:93%
- It seems like everyone came.
- Ma Wang.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.900 line:93%
- Ma Wang.
- So you have been waiting for me?

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.630 line:93%
That's mine right?

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.700 line:93%
Oh, you were waiting for the packages.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.740 line:93%
But... it doesn't look like anything much is prepared... Ah!

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.410 line:93%
It's not like this is a distribution center. Hey, Bu Ja.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.250 line:93%
I told you to take off the address labels on the packages

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.420 line:93%
and flatten them up for recycling instead of piling them up like this, didn't I?

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.340 line:93%
Yeah.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:59.180 line:93%
So you've arrived, Ma Wang.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.630 line:93%
Oh! You're here too are you, Pal Gye?

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.740 line:93%
Oh this, what is it?

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.810 line:93%
- Why are you here?
- You know I come here just to eat and play a lot these days.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.990 line:93%
Playing and eating all day, are you some kind of a pig...

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.680 line:93%
Oh yea. You are a pig.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.750 line:93%
Jeo Pal Gye, are you a pig?

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.310 line:93%
I'm not an ordinary pig.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.670 line:93%
Oh, this? Oh, it's this!

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.750 line:93%
This is it, right? The perfume to cover up the smell of rot, right?

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:39.910 line:93%
Ah, that's the perfume that got the presidential medal that gets rid of the rotting smell!

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.730 line:93%
Son Oh Gong recommended this to me.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.690 line:93%
It's lotus flower fragrance.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:49.600 line:93%
Good. Good. Spray it all over yourself.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.650 line:93%
Internet, Internet, huh? Internet. The main page of the website.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.190 line:93%
So you've arrived, Ma Wang?

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.630 line:93%
What is all this?

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:22.350 line:93%
Hyungnim Oh Gong said that he's lost his appetite these days, so I made him some side dishes.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.550 line:93%
I read on the news today that you have a tour

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.390 line:93%
scheduled for Europe with the VIP of the Blue House starting tomorrow, no?

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:36.710 line:93%
Yeah, that's why I was going to make a few different types of side dishes before leaving.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.730 line:93%
There's not a single one of the dishes I like.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.570 line:93%
If you tell me what you like, I'll make it for you.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.100 line:93%
It's alright.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.500 line:93%
Ok. Then I won't make it.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.990 line:93%
Damn it. Nobody knew.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:17.020 line:93%
No wonder. I thought my cosmetics kept running low. So you've been using them, huh?

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.070 line:93%
Let me remind you again. The house is under joint ownership, not everything in the house.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.770 line:93%
Don't use my stuff and don't hang your clothes on my bull horn. Also,

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.100 line:93%
when visitors come, tell the security office beforehand and get a parking sticker.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.830 line:93%
And tell Bu Ja to stop having packages delivered.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.460 line:93%
If you've brought a kid in, you should take her out for walks or something.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.460 line:93%
You keep shoving her in the fridge, so she keeps watching home shopping all day!

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:44.880 line:93%
Look! You use my cosmetics and you don't even close the caps. Ugh.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.450 line:93%
You thug.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.900 line:93%
Anyway, congrats Ma Wang. I heard you're getting an award.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.940 line:93%
- You knew?
- Yeah.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.560 line:93%
I heard it's some first place prize. How amazing. That's Ma Wang.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.100 line:93%
This.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.870 line:93%
You use it by squeezing it out like this.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.910 line:93%
And you should use this as the step before. It's very effective.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.600 line:93%
If you're going to use it, use it directly.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.570 line:93%
Come here.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:36.270 line:93%
Around the eyes, gently, gently. There.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:44.610 line:93%
Ma Wang, I feel really crappy. Even after taking a bath for 3 hours I still don't feel any better.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.670 line:93%
Do you have low blood pressure? If you're low on sugar, it can happen.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.740 line:93%
Eat some sweets and go to bed.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.720 line:93%
Ma Wang. Sam Jang says she doesn't like me.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.690 line:93%
You already knew that.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.440 line:93%
You're in a one-sided love.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.520 line:93%
I never realized that her not liking me would be this painful.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.260 line:93%
Her pain is your pain. When she's hurting you'll hurt too.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.330 line:93%
However, your pain isn't her pain. Even if you collapse from pain, she'll feel nothing.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.630 line:93%
Even if you collapse from pain, she'll feel nothing.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.110 line:93%
Only I am hurting, and she is not.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.970 line:93%
It feels like I'm always losing. This is the worst.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.230 line:93%
If you don't want to be in pain then all you have to do is not love her,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.700 line:93%
but that's not a possibility for you now is it, Great Sage?

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.180 line:93%
It's not like you can share the pain.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.000 line:93%
You're going to get dark circles.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.100 line:93%
Here, here. Put this on your face before you sleep.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.460 line:93%
I was taking a walk but didn't want to walk home alone.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.710 line:93%
So I came to have a drink. Is that alright for you?

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.040 line:93%
There are nights when we don't want to be alone.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.640 line:93%
But why did you come alone? You should have called Son Oh Gong.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.780 line:93%
He doesn't like being called when he can't even drink.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.400 line:93%
Even if he doesn't like it, he will come whenever you call him.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.070 line:93%
But I don't like that anyway. It's not like he is coming on his own free will.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.570 line:93%
He has no choice but to come because of the Geumganggo.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.410 line:93%
You must be sad that it's not genuine.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.760 line:93%
Pardon? What's there to be sad about?

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.100 line:93%
His feelings are all fake after all.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.590 line:93%
I'm a fool to take them seriously.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.510 line:93%
But even so, you shouldn't ignore them.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:50.580 line:93%
No matter what, right now he is in love with you and can get hurt easily.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.440 line:93%
The hurt he feels is real.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.880 line:93%
Last night, Sam Jang came to my sister's bar alone.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.060 line:93%
She went there alone?

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.900 line:93%
Apparently, now that the two of them have gotten close, she's going to visit often when she wants to drink by herself.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.800 line:93%
Really? I guess I will stop by there every night then.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.050 line:93%
What's with them?

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.380 line:93%
They're fans waiting for Pal Gye.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.200 line:93%
They hear rumors from time to time that he'll be coming here and wait like that all night for him.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.550 line:93%
How pitiful. Why in the world would they do something like that?

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.630 line:93%
Because they love him. They chase after him like that to express their love.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.520 line:93%
Even though Pal Gye doesn't like them doing that.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.100 line:93%
Why wouldn't he like it when they're only following him around because they love him?

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.910 line:93%
It's burdensome when people get so attached like that.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.870 line:93%
They've been there for hours putting in the effort just to give Pal Gye their gifts.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.520 line:93%
It's a bit pitiful.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.830 line:93%
You said you were taking this as a gift for Sam Jang, right?

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.790 line:93%
Forget it. I'm not going to put in that kind of effort. I'm not pitiful like that!

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.140 line:93%
Why should I take something like this to her?

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.960 line:93%
Because you love her. Don't you?

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.970 line:93%
General Winter, do I look the same as those girls to you?

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.070 line:93%
Waiting even though no one said to come and giving gifts even though they weren't asked for.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.130 line:93%
Whenever you're about to lie you freeze up.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:34.070 line:93%
Am I really in the same boat with them? As the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, shouldn't I be a bit different?

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:41.000 line:93%
"Oppa" "Oppa"
"I love you, Oppa!"

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.840 line:93%
<i>Thanks to this thing, it's probably why I'm loving you like crazy.</i>

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.040 line:93%
<i>I keep missing you so I can't leave from here!</i>

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.700 line:93%
<i>Why do you miss me?</i>

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.460 line:93%
<i>Because I love you like crazy!</i>

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:59.110 line:93%
<i>Because I love you. Because I love you. Because I love you. Because I love you.</i>

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.950 line:93%
<i>Because you love me?</i>

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.620 line:93%
<i>Then there's nothing I could do.</i>

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.570 line:93%
It's exactly the same.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.780 line:93%
Damn.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:17.150 line:93%
CEO, a ton of secret camera recordings were found at that motel owner's home.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.550 line:93%
I caught this incredibly heinous criminal. Me!

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:26.430 line:93%
You did something really great, Lee Han Joo. You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.830 line:93%
Of course not. How could a man get injured over something like that.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:35.650 line:93%
Maybe it was because of this strong sense of justice telling me "You've gotta catch that guy!",

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.340 line:93%
but in that moment my body just went whoosh flying through the air on it's own.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.700 line:93%
That's right. It went whoosh through the air indeed.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:48.010 line:93%
Oh, yeah. Wasn't the guy that was with us your guard?

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.690 line:93%
How can a guard be like that? Just standing still in a time of danger? Hurry and kick up a fuss asking them to have him switched out.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.420 line:93%
I'm not in a position to kick up a fuss to have him switched out.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.060 line:93%
And it's not like he's doing it because he wants to. It was my choice.

Living a miserable life and dying in excruciating pain.

A punishment in which she has to keep living a cruel life over and over again.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:30.330 line:93%
The most recent is dying from a gunshot in Gyeongseong about 100 years ago.

Then even if she is reincarnated, she will die a tragic death?

Can't Ma Wang release her from that?

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.350 line:93%
What Ma Wang can do is to become a deity quickly.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:45.120 line:93%
Only then can he end the eternal cycle of death and rebirth.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.670 line:93%
He will have to become a deity as soon as possible.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.400 line:93%
- Oh, right. They actually are dog's paws.
- I apologize.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.710 line:93%
I would need Sam Jang in order to lure her and catch her.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.970 line:93%
Call Sam Jang.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.230 line:93%
- Is this your favorite movie?
- Yes.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.380 line:93%
But I've never seen it at the movie theater.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.210 line:93%
It's been re-released, but tonight's the last showing.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.200 line:93%
I'm really glad I'm going to get to watch it.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.180 line:93%
There's a lot of time left. Want to watch another movie while we wait?

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.270 line:93%
Is there a movie you want to watch?

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.320 line:93%
Let's see...

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:11.660 line:93%
This one looks great. It must be a movie with a warm storyline. It has little clothing.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.010 line:93%
I like movies with warm stories.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.050 line:93%
Do you think they're wearing little clothes because it has a warm storyline?

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:20.090 line:93%
They're probably wearing little because it's has a warm storyline.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:24.790 line:93%
I was born from a volcano, so I like warm atmospheres like this, you see.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:28.290 line:93%
I feel sick to my stomach because of you.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.580 line:93%
It's warm and nice.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.860 line:93%
What a nuisance. Why is he calling again?

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.070 line:93%
<i>[Lucifer Entertainment]</i>

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.330 line:93%
Why are you calling us for this? It's simple. Just burn it.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:52.390 line:93%
I already told you. I need this film for the screening event tomorrow.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:55.170 line:93%
But you can't play it in front of so many people.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.970 line:93%
No matter how I think of it, I think it's best to cancel the screening and burn it.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:03.260 line:93%
That's not possible. This film is the deciding factor for Ma Wang to receive his presidential medal.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.120 line:93%
- Without this, they won't give you the medal?
- I'm sure they would give it.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:11.070 line:93%
But, if I go to receive the award after burning the film I donated,

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.300 line:93%
wouldn't that be disgraceful?

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.250 line:93%
They'll badmouth him for reaping the rewards and then ditching.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:19.610 line:93%
Or they might spread gossip that this was planned from the start just so he could get the award.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.420 line:93%
After being so happy that you're getting the award, it looks like you're going to get a ton of criticism.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.770 line:93%
You'll pass through being cursed. It's the ultimate pass.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:32.830 line:93%
That's why I'm saying we need to go in the film and get the kid out before the film screening.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:36.010 line:93%
I think you will need to go in, Sam Jang.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.390 line:93%
Okay.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:42.170 line:93%
Damn, we have to go watch a movie, but it looks like we're going to be watching this out-dated film instead.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.260 line:93%
You stay out here.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.610 line:93%
I'm not taking Son Oh Gong with me. Last time when we went into the portrait,

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:54.050 line:93%
you locked up our Oh Gong in there.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:59.560 line:93%
You might do that again, so Ma Wang should come with me this time.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.610 line:93%
That's right. Our Oh Gong will not go in. Ma Wang go in.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:16.180 line:93%
Come out within an hour. Then you'll be able to watch the movie you like. I'll wait.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.790 line:93%
Well... all right.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:24.620 line:93%
Hurry and get ready.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.600 line:93%
Oh, look at that quality. I'm already bored.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.740 line:93%
Oh, there they are.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.600 line:93%
They made it inside well I see.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:58.230 line:93%
The film is an hour long. They'll need to find her and come out before it's over.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.390 line:93%
She will come out before then.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:04.210 line:93%
You see, our Sam Jang has to go watch a movie with me.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.290 line:93%
Good.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.910 line:93%
We're inside the film's recorded length of an hour.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:46.040 line:93%
If you mess anything up, it'll ruin the invaluable filmstrip

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.300 line:93%
so please be careful.

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.500 line:93%
<i>Lee Soo Il and Sim Soon Ae</i>

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.170 line:93%
So there were movies at this time as well?

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:04.340 line:93%
Ah, it's Lee Soo Il and Sim Soon Ae.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:09.880 line:93%
During this time, they were silent films, but the silent-film narrators were spectacular.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.370 line:93%
"Therefore, Lee Soo Il and Sim Soon Ae

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:17.820 line:93%
"crossed the line they shouldn't have." Hah!

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.020 line:93%
What do you think? Do you want to stop by the theater real quick?

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.890 line:93%
There is no time. We must hurry.

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:27.950 line:93%
You must be in a hurry, because of the movie you're supposed to watch out there.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.770 line:93%
Since it's a movie I like.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.030 line:93%
What did you say the little girl looks like?

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:40.660 line:93%
A little girl wearing a red kimono about this tall.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.430 line:93%
It probably won't be of much help, but...

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.220 line:93%
This is a sketch Secretary Ma made.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.530 line:93%
We'll be able to find her with this then.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.310 line:93%
How can you recognize her with a picture drawn with a dog's paw?

00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:01.310 line:93%
The defining features are very clear. A flower printed kimono, a short bob haircut,

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:06.350 line:93%
A round face, big eyes, and a mole here.

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:09.130 line:93%
You're really quite amazing.

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:14.350 line:93%
A flower printed red kimono like this should have been quite expensive during this time period.

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:17.920 line:93%
For now, should we look for a store that sells kimonos?

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.060 line:93%
That's a good idea. In this time period's Gyeongseong street,

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.660 line:93%
there was a kimono shop somewhere.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.210 line:93%
Probably at the end of this street.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:32.870 line:93%
It's a bit of a walk so let's take the tram.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.650 line:93%
Ah, here it comes now.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.310 line:93%
Ma Wang! Ma Wang!

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:19.740 line:93%
I'm sorry, but just go. I'll follow you later.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.600 line:93%
When in danger, just call Son Oh Gong.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.330 line:93%
It was definitely her.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:59.180 line:93%
Excuse me. What year and day is it right now here in Gyeongseong?

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.750 line:93%
It's Moo In Nyeon, first month, sixth day.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.520 line:93%
Ah, yes.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:09.580 line:93%
Moo In Nyeon... that means it's 1938...

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:14.510 line:93%
She died in 1939, so it's one year before her death.

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:44.380 line:93%
Ma Wang said that it seemed like you learned to dance when you were alive.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.350 line:93%
This is our dance practice studio.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.370 line:93%
Is coming here making you remember anything?

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.250 line:93%
Just a really strong feeling of longing.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:57.490 line:93%
Think about it more carefully.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.650 line:93%
I'll get you another energy bead. Wait here.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:26.640 line:93%

Who are you?

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.970 line:93%
Who are you?

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.730 line:93%
Are you a trainee?

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:13.640 line:93%
You don't know the rules? Trainees aren't allowed in here.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.100 line:93%
I'm dead tired, so just get out.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.560 line:93%
And throw this away on your way out.

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:28.540 line:93%
What is with the smell?

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:31.540 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:37.190 line:93%
Where do you think you're spraying that? It'll leave an odor! Get out!

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:38.490 line:93%
You're pissing me off to death.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:42.240 line:93%
If you keep talking about death like that, it's possible you might really die.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.870 line:93%
You're so unbelievable I could die.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:50.920 line:93%
Get out. A trainee should get their butt out of an artist's practice room.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.150 line:93%
Hey. what's wrong with you?

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.500 line:93%
I didn't even push you that hard. Why are you falling over?

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.840 line:93%
Hey.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:16.690 line:93%
What is going on? Did she really... die?

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:21.850 line:93%
Bu Ja!

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:26.570 line:93%
PK. I must've killed a person. What do I do?

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:29.650 line:93%
That is... Hey!

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:40.140 line:93%
Bu Ja, you shouldn't play around with people.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.250 line:93%
Her, she is full of bad manners.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.740 line:93%
She even makes a dead person angry.

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:48.640 line:93%
What do we do about her?

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:56.300 line:93%
We're going say Alice drank too much with me, so she's a confused mess about what happened today. Got it?

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.710 line:93%
Bu Ja, you remembered something from when you were alive?

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:06.540 line:93%
A memory of dancing while looking at myself in a mirror came to me.

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:10.430 line:93%
Do you think I was a dancer?

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.020 line:93%
I'll look into whether there were any missing persons among the dancers.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.630 line:93%
Why do you think I died?

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.510 line:93%
You didn't die a natural death but were murdered.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:22.630 line:93%
Your death probably wasn't pretty.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:29.410 line:93%
We don't know what might come to light when you get your memories back. Are you prepared for that?

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.770 line:93%
I... need some air for a sec.

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:41.610 line:93%
You meanie pig.

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:47.350 line:93%
There are times when being cold like in cold pig's feet (<i>food dish</i>) is needed.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.900 line:93%
Let's not cry. Let's wait until they shut the coffin lid on me.

This is it?

Hey, dog secretary.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.790 line:93%
You said the girl looked to be around eight years old, right?

00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.960 line:93%
Yes. It was a young Japanese girl.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:04.220 line:93%
If she's an evil spirit, then it means she died around eight years of age.

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:07.930 line:93%
Then who is this old lady?

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.690 line:93%

It's the same person.

If that young girl lived until she got this old...

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.490 line:93%
Then who was the one that went into the film?

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:35.390 line:93%
Miss Akiko. Miss Akiko. Miss.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:39.450 line:93%
Please don't run. Miss Akiko.

- Ahhh

You said you'd do everything that I want you to do for me, right?

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:50.020 line:93%
Then you mustn't ever do the things that I don't want.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:56.150 line:93%
I really don't want to like you.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.020 line:93%
Don't ask me to like you.

01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:13.830 line:93%
If that's what you want, then that's what I'll do.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:03.200 line:93%
Great Sage, what's with all this?

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.460 line:93%
You're here, Ma Wang? Congrats on your award.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.130 line:93%
We should have a party.

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:15.210 line:93%
Again today, the only one that remembers me is Great Sage I see.

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:17.730 line:93%
That's just how the other kids are.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:24.900 line:93%
At any rate, I do feel a bit bad about drinking by myself.

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:30.340 line:93%
I brought the best wine out of my entire collection in Sureumdong

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:32.220 line:93%
to share it with you.

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.620 line:93%
You went that far to congratulate me?

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:39.270 line:93%
It's not just to congratulate you. I have another thing to share with you.

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.720 line:93%
What?

01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:50.170 line:93%
I'm being really tormented because of Geumganggo.

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:55.620 line:93%
But, you know what? Sam Jang said she's being tormented too.

01:17:58.690 --> 01:18:01.260 line:93%
Love

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:06.920 line:93%
Because of Geumganggo both Sam Jang and I are feeling torment,

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.980 line:93%
in that case, shouldn't you feel torment as well, Ma Wang?

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.620 line:93%
Pardon?

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:17.710 line:93%
Ma Wang, share in our pain.

01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:26.520 line:93%
What did you do?

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.210 line:93%
- In here?
- I put a little something in that wine.

01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:34.700 line:93%
A little what?

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.460 line:93%
Sam Jang's blood.

01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:48.100 line:93%
Don't joke with me.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.530 line:93%
There's no way I wouldn't be able to recognize the smell of that.

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:59.350 line:93%
That's why I've been filling this house with the scent of lotus flowers all this time.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:18.650 line:93%
<i>Son Oh Gong told me to keep scented candles lit all day for Ma Wang.</i>

01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:26.840 line:93%
Damn it. Sam Jang's blood smells like lotus flowers.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:33.100 line:93%
When you weren't paying attention, I took and used the blood that you've been keeping.

01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:42.210 line:93%
Sam Jang should be here any minute now. Looks like you're going to get to find out what the effect of that will be.

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:51.350 line:93%
The pain of wanting something you can never have, you try having a taste of that too now, Ma Wang.

01:19:57.090 --> 01:19:59.000 line:93%
Looks like she's here.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:08.460 line:93%
