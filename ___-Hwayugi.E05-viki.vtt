00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.130 line:93%
<i>President Woo Hwi of Lucifer Entertainment 1930s Record Film Donation</i>

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.640 line:93%
Yes.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.380 line:93%
Oh, thank you.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.210 line:93%
Thank you.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.840 line:93%
The 1930's record film you donated will become a

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.550 line:93%
priceless legacy.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.730 line:93%
You did something great.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.300 line:93%
It was no big deal.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.400 line:93%
It was a big deal.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.870 line:93%
In order to retrieve that film from Heidelberg University in Germany, he traveled five times

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.000 line:93%
and donated one million dollars.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.690 line:93%
When you display the film, we ask that you please place a write-up of all his efforts with it.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.190 line:93%
- What do you mean?
- A great deed must be known.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.730 line:93%
When we host the film screening, we plan on extensively announcing all your achievements.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.020 line:93%
Aigoo, there is no need to do that...

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.590 line:93%
Also, from the Ministry of Culture,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.680 line:93%
I heard that you will be receiving the presidential medal

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.300 line:93%
for culture artist award.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.430 line:93%
The presidential medal?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.880 line:93%
Oh, well they didn't have to do such ...

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.890 line:93%
This kind of good deed is another way for me to become a god.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.970 line:93%
There is nothing to be impressed about receiving an award from a human,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.430 line:93%
but it feels good to show off, so it's not so bad.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.770 line:93%
I will spread around the article extensively so that there will be many opportunities for you to boast freely.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.810 line:93%
They said the medal ceremony will be televised live, right?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.200 line:93%
I better get a new outfit made. I have nothing to wear next week.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.370 line:93%
Excuse me. We will pass by.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.360 line:93%
There are interesting things at a museum.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.700 line:93%
Among the old items, there are ones which the ownersâ souls are attached to.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.430 line:93%
Be careful! This sword belonged to a general who saved this nation.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.990 line:93%
It seems like the owner of that sword is a remarkable person.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.440 line:93%
They say the owner saved the nation.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.610 line:93%
The one who used that sword to save the nation is that woman, but it seems people are unaware of the real owner.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.520 line:93%
If they find out it's an unknown woman's sword instead of an honorable general's sword,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.160 line:93%
they wouldn't cherish it that way.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.110 line:93%
Among the many things preciously displayed in this place

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.340 line:93%
they probably hold different truths than what has been known.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.540 line:93%
<i>[A Beautiful Donation]</i>

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.750 line:93%
Some could hold hideous secrets perhaps.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.880 line:93%
Is this the motel where strange things happen?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.210 line:93%
Yes. There's been many strange rumors, so customers have stopped coming.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.660 line:93%
The owner got scared and wants to sell it as fast as possible, so heâs asking for half the market value.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.600 line:93%
Let's go in.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.760 line:93%
Woah. The bathtub is extremely big.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.990 line:93%
What do you mean by strange rumors?

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.230 line:93%
Well, first of all, this is a motel, you know?

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.810 line:93%
So what it is is the kind of bling-bling, you know,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.430 line:93%
so when couples are in the midst of their love-love business

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.830 line:93%
they say something strange just pops out all of sudden and ruins it all.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.380 line:93%
It doesn't make sense right? They should go to the hospital or eat some eel instead. (known to be good for stamina)

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.460 line:93%
They're only making excuses because they're lacking, seriously.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.320 line:93%
It seems like there isn't anything especially odd.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.350 line:93%
There is something. Who is that?

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.290 line:93%
Wow, this is great! Wow.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.000 line:93%
The room is nice and warm. Oh, this is totally my style.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.660 line:93%
Why does that guy keep following us wherever we work these days?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.750 line:93%
That guy,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.030 line:93%
he's the one who was at your house that time, right?

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.210 line:93%
- The one who told me to get lost.
- Look at this style.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.540 line:93%
Don't worry about him. He's someone who protects me ... kind of.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.080 line:93%
Guard? He's a guard?

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.610 line:93%
The entertainment already gave you a personal bodyguard?

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.020 line:93%
Well, it's something like that.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.690 line:93%
It's not like you're even the least bit famous but already giving you a bodyguard.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.760 line:93%
Lucifer Entertainment... Wow, it's the jackpot!

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.290 line:93%
Giving you a bodyguard already... Wow, Lucifer Entertainment.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.510 line:93%
Woah. Jackpot!

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.440 line:93%
It even has this sort of thing? Wow, this is totally state-of-the-art.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.230 line:93%
CEO, but just because you're not popular yet,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.750 line:93%
I think they assigned you a person who's lacking something, too. He's a bit...

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.550 line:93%
- Weird right?
- Yes.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.120 line:93%
But, he can hear even if we whisper so we can't badmouth him.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.330 line:93%
If we badmouth him, we'll be in trouble.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.130 line:93%
Okay.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.090 line:93%
Oh, you're here? Alright, just a minute.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.360 line:93%
The building owner came with the key to the rooftop. I'll go get it.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.580 line:93%
Seriously.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.890 line:93%
Son Oh Gong, there seems to be an evil spirit in here right?

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.410 line:93%
I'm not sure. But this room is really great.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.910 line:93%
The bed's big. The bathtub's big. I want to live in a room like this.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.590 line:93%
- This isn't a room you can live in.
-I can't live here?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.070 line:93%
Then, what do you do here?

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.120 line:93%
That's enough. Knock it off with the embarrassing talk and find the evil spirit already.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.010 line:93%
Why? What's wrong? This room has a bigger TV than your house.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.250 line:93%
Do you want to watch a movie with me tonight?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.480 line:93%
Oh! Wow, they even deliver chicken. I really like chicken!

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.950 line:93%
So a place like this existed in this world. I should sleep here before I go.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.280 line:93%
- What?
- Who do you think you're trying to fool with the innocent act?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.350 line:93%
Aren't you embarrassed of lying while looking at me straight in the face?

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.810 line:93%
I am embarrassed. You think I wouldn't be?

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.020 line:93%
But what can I do? Since I love you.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.820 line:93%
That's what love is like. So what if I get a little embarrassed?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.310 line:93%
When today, I could even sleep with you here.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.960 line:93%
I'm embarrassed of your love talk.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.370 line:93%
Right.... I should love you...

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.880 line:93%
What's happening?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.400 line:93%
What are you doing? Making my heart flutter...

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.770 line:93%
You heard earlier. We have to "love-love" for the evil spirit to appear.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.020 line:93%
Oh, "love-love"

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.000 line:93%
That's a good idea, but I don't think this is enough to make it appear.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.860 line:93%
- When it appears, you catch it right away.
-Okay.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:23.020 line:93%
But, you know, if it still doesn't appear, what should we do?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.070 line:93%
Well, in that case...

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:32.050 line:93%
U-um, in that case...

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.200 line:93%
Then...

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.970 line:93%
Hold on.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.990 line:93%
Why, you! No manners whatsoever!

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.640 line:93%
- You caught it?
- Yeah. But I don't think there's just one.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.980 line:93%
Let's hurry and keep going.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.670 line:93%
You know there's only one! Don't try any funny business!

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.550 line:93%
Agh, that damned evil spirit. Seriously...

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.230 line:93%
But why was that evil spirit attracted to this place?

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.560 line:93%
<i>Huh?
Fried Chicken</i>

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.630 line:93%
It was attracted to a truly filthy wickedness that exists here.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:46.380 line:93%
A filthy desire to watch people in secret and the obscene greed to make money off of it.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.890 line:93%
There was something like this in the room.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.860 line:93%
This must be something a person set up, right?

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.820 line:93%
Of course.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.750 line:93%
CEO.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.830 line:93%
The owner says he's available to sign a contract right away.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.530 line:93%
Hello. Who will I be doing a contract with...

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.700 line:93%
Ah, damn it...

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.460 line:93%
- Catch that person!
- Pardon?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.990 line:93%
-Hurry! Hurry!
-Why, why, why?!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.660 line:93%
Sir! Sir!

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.130 line:93%
Oh my god! Oh my god!

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.370 line:93%
Are you all right?

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.200 line:93%
Turns out we caught both an evil spirit and an evil person today.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.050 line:93%
If we keep digging up one after another like this, we should be able to prevent the evil events I see.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.380 line:93%
Don't you think so too, Son Oh Gong?

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.650 line:93%
Whether this world breaks apart or blows up, it has nothing to do with me.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.620 line:93%
I just need to protect you because I love you.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.500 line:93%
I'm thankful.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.370 line:93%
But still, this world I love shouldn't get destroyed.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.180 line:93%
What you love isn't important.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.090 line:93%
The only thing that's important is that I love you.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.990 line:93%
That's right. No matter how I feel, the only person in love is you.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.860 line:93%
I'm going to go home, so you can leave.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.720 line:93%
Let's go together. I like going with you.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.600 line:93%
Because you love me?

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.460 line:93%
Then too bad.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.690 line:93%
What do you mean? Why?

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.120 line:93%
The air's nice for once, and the band I like released a new song.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.120 line:93%
I wanted to go for a walk by myself while listening to it.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.270 line:93%
When going for a walk in a good mood while listening to good music and breathing in good air,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.520 line:93%
Me being next to you should make it even better, no?

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.390 line:93%
It's not...

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.780 line:93%
The only person in love is you. I'm not in love.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.290 line:93%
But you know I'm not in love because I want to be.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.150 line:93%
Okay, I get it. Come with me then.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.200 line:93%
- Go by yourself.
- You can come with me.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.360 line:93%
It's fine, go.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.420 line:93%
Hurry and go!

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.800 line:93%
Okay.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.760 line:93%
<i>I'll be done, and you'll be alone again.</i>

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.220 line:93%
I have to come to my senses.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.020 line:93%
Is this it?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.030 line:93%
What the...

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.870 line:93%
What is this?

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.240 line:93%
Do you want to know who I am?

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.250 line:93%
You're a Japanese kid? How did you get in? Who are you?!

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.840 line:93%
Nobody must know who I am.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.490 line:93%
Don't come near me. Stay away!

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.720 line:93%
What the...

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.430 line:93%
Damn it!

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.650 line:93%
Who was that kid earlier?

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.010 line:93%
She's not coming, right?

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.200 line:93%
The news about you receiving the presidential medal made the main page of the web portal.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.990 line:93%
Ah, is that so? Let's see...

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.550 line:93%
They should've used a good picture of me...

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.990 line:93%
Should I post in the group chat that you'll be receiving the medal?

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:49.810 line:93%
When it's on the front page of the site like this, I'm sure everyone's seen it. It's fine.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.470 line:93%
You worked hard.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.490 line:93%
Oh, Chairman.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.260 line:93%
These packages just arrived. Why don't you take them with you?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260 line:93%
Ah, yes, of course.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:17.940 line:93%
Huh? These are Jin Bu Ja's again. That girl is in a home shopping craze these days. What's with all these?

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:24.420 line:93%
It's another day that you have a lot of outside visitors.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.970 line:93%
Any visitor who parks

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.960 line:93%
needs to get a parking sticker first. Please be aware from now on.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.970 line:93%
Yes,  I understand. But it seems like there are a lot of visitors today?

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.940 line:93%
Yes, as you can see.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.250 line:93%
By the way, I saw the article about you.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.480 line:93%
You mean the presidential medal?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.700 line:93%
That's why all your acquaintances must have come to hold a party to congratulate you.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:57.580 line:93%
Just what is so great about a presidential medal? They are making such a fuss!

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.360 line:93%
Aigoo, congratulations!

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.570 line:93%
â« Always by your side...

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.080 line:93%
These darn people are really- The presidential medal...

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.940 line:93%
The presidential medal.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.000 line:93%
It seems like everyone came.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.200 line:93%
- Ma Wang.
- So you have been waiting for me?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.930 line:93%
That's mine right?

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.000 line:93%
Oh, you were waiting for the packages.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.040 line:93%
But...it doesn't look like anything much is prepared...Ah!

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:47.710 line:93%
It's not like this is a distribution center. Hey, Bu Ja.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.550 line:93%
I told you to take off the address labels on the packages

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.720 line:93%
and flatten them up for recycling instead of piling them up like this, didn't I?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.640 line:93%
Yeah.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.480 line:93%
So you've arrived, Ma Wang.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.930 line:93%
Oh! You're here too are you, Pal Gye?

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.040 line:93%
Oh this, what is it?

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.110 line:93%
- Why are you here?
- You know I come here just to eat and play a lot these days.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:20.290 line:93%
Playing and eating all day, are you some kind of a pig...

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.980 line:93%
Oh yea. You are a pig.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.050 line:93%
Jeo Pal Gye, you are a pig?

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.610 line:93%
I'm not an ordinary pig.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.970 line:93%
Oh, this? Oh, it's this!

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.050 line:93%
This is it, right? The perfume to cover up the smell of rot, right?

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:43.210 line:93%
Ah, that's the perfume that got the presidential medal that gets rid of the rotting smell!

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.030 line:93%
Son Oh Gong recommended this to me.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.990 line:93%
It's lotus flower fragrance.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.900 line:93%
Good. Good. Spray it all over yourself.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:19:00.050 line:93%
Internet, Internet, huh? Internet. The main page of the website.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.090 line:93%
So you've arrived, Ma Wang?

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.930 line:93%
What is all this?

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:25.650 line:93%
Oh Gong said that he's lost his appetite these days, so I made him some side dishes.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:34.690 line:93%
I read on the news today that you have a tour scheduled for Europe with the VIP of the Blue House starting tomorrow, no?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:40.010 line:93%
Yeah, that's why I was going to make a few different types of side dishes before leaving.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.030 line:93%
There's not a single of one my dishes that I like.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.870 line:93%
If you tell me what you like, I'll make it for you.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.400 line:93%
It's alright.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.800 line:93%
Ok. Then I won't make it.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.290 line:93%
Damn it. Nobody knew.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:20.320 line:93%
No wonder. I thought my cosmetics kept running low. So you've been using them, huh?

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:26.370 line:93%
Let me remind you again. The house is under joint ownership, not everything in the house.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.070 line:93%
Don't use my stuff and don't hang your clothes on my bull horn. Also,

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:36.130 line:93%
when visitors come, tell the security office beforehand and get a parking sticker. And tell Bu Ja to stop getting packages delivered.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.760 line:93%
If you've brought a kid in, you should take her out for walks or something.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.760 line:93%
You keep shoving her in the fridge, so she keeps looking at home shopping all day!

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.180 line:93%
Look! You use my cosmetics and you don't even close the caps. Ugh.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.750 line:93%
You hooligan

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:54.200 line:93%
Anyway, congrats Ma Wang. I heard you're getting an award.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.240 line:93%
- You knew?
- Yeah.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.860 line:93%
I heard it's some first place prize. How amazing. That's Ma Wang.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.400 line:93%
This.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.170 line:93%
You use it by squeezing it out like this.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.870 line:93%
Come here.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.570 line:93%
Around the eyes, gently, gently. There.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:47.910 line:93%
Ma Wang, I feel really crappy. Even after taking a bath for 3 hours I still don't feel any better.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:55.040 line:93%
Do you have low blood pressure? If you're low on sugar, it can happen. Eat some sweets and go to bed.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.020 line:93%
Ma Wang. Sam Jang says she doesn't like me.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.990 line:93%
You already knew that.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.740 line:93%
You're in a one-sided love.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.820 line:93%
I never realized that her not liking me would be this painful.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.360 line:93%
Her pain is your pain. When she's hurting you'll hurt too. However,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.930 line:93%
your pain isn't her pain. Even if you collapse from pain, she'll feel nothing.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.410 line:93%
Only I am hurting, and she is not.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.270 line:93%
It feels like I'm always losing. This is the worst.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.530 line:93%
If you don't want to be in pain then all you have to do is not love her,

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.000 line:93%
but that's not a possibility for you now is it, Great Sage?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.480 line:93%
It's not like you can share the pain.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:46.400 line:93%
You're going to get dark circles. Here, put this on your face before you sleep.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.760 line:93%
I was taking a walk but didn't want to walk home alone.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.010 line:93%
So I came to have a drink. Is that alright for you?

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.340 line:93%
There are nights when we don't want to be alone.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.940 line:93%
But why did you come alone? You should have called Son Oh Gong.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.080 line:93%
He doesn't like being called when he can't even drink.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.700 line:93%
Even if he doesn't like it, he will come whenever you call him.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.370 line:93%
But I don't like that anyway. It's not like he is coming on his own free will.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.870 line:93%
He has no choice but to come because of the Geumganggo.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.710 line:93%
You must be sad that it's not genuine.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:41.400 line:93%
Pardon? What's there to be sad about? His feelings are all fake after all.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.890 line:93%
I'm a fool to take them seriously.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.810 line:93%
But even so, you shouldn't ignore them.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:53.880 line:93%
No matter what, right now he is in love with you and can get hurt easily.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.740 line:93%
The hurt he feels is real.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.180 line:93%
Last night, Sam Jang came to my sister's bar alone.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.360 line:93%
She went there alone?

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.200 line:93%
Apparently, now that the two of them have gotten close, she's going to visit often when she wants to drink by herself.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.100 line:93%
Really? I guess I will stop by there every night then.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.350 line:93%
What's with them?

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:30.500 line:93%
They're fans waiting for Pal Gye. They hear rumors from time to time that he'll be coming here and wait like that all night for him.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.850 line:93%
How pitiful. Why in the world would they do something like that?

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:39.820 line:93%
Because they love him. They chase after him like that to express their love. Even though Pal Gye doesn't like them doing that.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.400 line:93%
Why wouldn't he like it when they're only following him around because they love him?

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.210 line:93%
It's burdensome when people get so attached like that.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:52.820 line:93%
They've been there for hours putting in the effort just to give Pal Gye their gifts. It's a bit pitiful.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.130 line:93%
You said you were taking this as a gift for Sam Jang, right?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.090 line:93%
Forget it. I'm not going to put in that kind of effort. I'm not pitiful like that!

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.440 line:93%
Why should I take something like this to her?

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.260 line:93%
Because you love her. Don't you?

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:17.270 line:93%
General Winter, do I look the same as those girls to you?

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.370 line:93%
Waiting even though no one said to come and giving gifts even though they weren't asked for.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:29.430 line:93%
Whenever you're about to lie you freeze up.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:37.370 line:93%
Am I really in the same boat with them? As the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, shouldn't I be a bit different?

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:44.300 line:93%
"Oppa" "Oppa"
"I love you, Oppa!"

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:50.140 line:93%
Thanks to this thing, it's probably why I'm loving you like crazy.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.340 line:93%
<i>I keep missing you so I can't leave from here!</i>

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.000 line:93%
<i>Why do you miss me?</i>

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.760 line:93%
<i>Because I love you like crazy!</i>

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:02.410 line:93%
<i>Because I love you. Because I love you. Because I love you. Because I love you.</i>

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.250 line:93%
<i>Because you love me?</i>

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.920 line:93%
<i>Then there's nothing I could do.</i>

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.870 line:93%
It's exactly the same.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.080 line:93%
Damn.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.450 line:93%
CEO, a ton of secret camera recordings were found at that motel owner's home.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.850 line:93%
I caught this incredibly heinous criminal. Me!

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:29.730 line:93%
You did something really great, Lee Han Joo. You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:34.130 line:93%
Of course not. How could a man get injured over something like that.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:41.640 line:93%
Maybe it was because of this strong sense of justice telling me "You've gotta catch that guy!", but in that moment my body just went whoosh flying through the air on it's own.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.000 line:93%
That's right. It went whoosh through the air indeed.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.310 line:93%
Oh, yeah. Wasn't the guy that was with us your guard?

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.990 line:93%
How can a guard be like that? Just standing still in a time of danger? Hurry and kick up a fuss asking them to have him switched out.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.720 line:93%
I'm not in a position to kick up a fuss to have him switched out.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.360 line:93%
And it's not like he's doing it because he wants to. It was my choice.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.640 line:93%
Our CEO is secretly a sucker for good looks, huh?

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.110 line:93%
Go to the bank.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.000 line:93%
Of course. I'll be back.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.670 line:93%
Oh, that startled me!

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.200 line:93%
<i>[Emack & Bolio's]
[Ice Cream that Rocks]</i>

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.330 line:93%
You were here?

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.220 line:93%
That realtor, how dare he cause trouble?

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.850 line:93%
- Who does he think he is to butt in and tell you to switch me out?
- You heard that?

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:40.220 line:93%
I'm an irreplaceable entity. I can't be switched out. If you have any complaints then switch out that human!

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.220 line:93%
It's been 3 years since I've worked with Lee Han Joo.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.670 line:93%
I haven't even known you 3 weeks and yet you're telling me to switch him out?

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.290 line:93%
So that's why you don't like me but value Lee Han Joo?

00:27:55.170 --> 00:28:01.350 line:93%
That's right. At the very least, Lee Han Joo knows that I don't like peanut flavored ice cream.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:08.000 line:93%
So you're saying that you don't like me or peanut ice-cream. Do you like Lee Han Joo?

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.090 line:93%
You said you didn't care about what I like.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:14.990 line:93%
You don't need to know. You're fine with just blindly loving me as you've been doing.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:27.010 line:93%
Then if I want to care about what you like will you tell me?

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:32.210 line:93%
I already knew that no matter how much I tell you I love you, you just take it as an annoyance.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:37.340 line:93%
And that you wouldn't care no matter how much pain I'm in.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.900 line:93%
<i>The hurt he feels is real.</i>

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.420 line:93%
I'll stop saying that I like you...

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.730 line:93%
So say what you like.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.300 line:93%
I'll listen and take interest in it.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.680 line:93%
Instead of peanut, what flavor do you like?

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.150 line:93%
I like strawberry flavored ice cream.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.840 line:93%
Then I'll bring you strawberry ice cream from now on.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.480 line:93%
<i>[F.T. Island Over Ten Years album]</i>

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.090 line:93%
- Is this the band that you like?
- Yeah.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.860 line:93%
What the heck? They're not even that good-looking.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.730 line:93%
They're good-looking to me!

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.610 line:93%
And? What else do you like?

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.990 line:93%
You're always in black. Do you like the color black?

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.350 line:93%
I like green.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.910 line:93%
I like green too.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:52.320 line:93%
The things that you like are important to me.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.670 line:93%
From now on, tell me all of them one by one.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.510 line:93%
What are you going to do about it if I tell you?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.860 line:93%
I can do everything. I can make a mountain out of strawberry ice cream,

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.500 line:93%
or even paint the whole world green. If that's what you want.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.730 line:93%
I'm scared that you really will do just that.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.520 line:93%
Don't be scared and  tell me. What do you like?

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.530 line:93%
Let's see...

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:28.770 line:93%

Tell me everything. I'll do all of it for you.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.710 line:93%
For now, go over there. After I organize my desk.

Ah, good morning.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:20.400 line:93%
Since you lit candles the house doesn't smell rotten. How nice.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.480 line:93%
You said your sense of smell is very acute

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.530 line:93%
Son Oh Gong told me to keep candles lit all day for you.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.520 line:93%
For me?

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.870 line:93%
It's said that people die if they do something they don't usually do.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:41.690 line:93%
Well, since he's a monkey, he probably wouldn't die from doing something out of character.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.330 line:93%
Yes, yes. Instead of watching the home shopping channel, you should watch things like this. It's fun, isn't it?

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.940 line:93%
Nice. Oh, you guys...Pass!

00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:01.150 line:93%
"Pass"
It even looks good when I seeing it too

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.000 line:93%
Ma Wang.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:09.260 line:93%
There's something that came to me after continuously watching this

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.370 line:93%
What is it?

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.470 line:93%
Bravo! Nice.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.310 line:93%
You...

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.600 line:93%
pass!

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.760 line:93%
Wow, seeing as you can move like that, you must have learned how to dance before Bu Ja.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.630 line:93%
That seems to be the case.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.290 line:93%
But why are you still like that?

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.140 line:93%
Isn't that pose uncomfortable?

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.870 line:93%
Ma Wang, I think I dislocated my pelvis.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.300 line:93%
What?

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.570 line:93%
Seriously. Why did you dance like you were alive for?

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.300 line:93%
Small-minded. Seriously...

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.220 line:93%
Are you going to...work...

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.910 line:93%

Know that the energy stone you ate today is extremely special.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.370 line:93%
There was a World Cup in 2002.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:58.020 line:93%
That's the very strong and rare energy I gathered from it.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.190 line:93%
Thank you!

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:05.320 line:93%
You might regain the memories from the moments before you died because your rotting brain gets revived.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.790 line:93%
Each time that happens, record it well.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.600 line:93%
I will.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.670 line:93%
Ma Wang, that's a really beautiful portrait.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.340 line:93%
Who is this person?

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.800 line:93%
Everyone called her the Princess Iron Fan,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.430 line:93%
but she was originally a deity named Cha Eun.

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:46.000 line:93%
By deity, you mean she's someone from the heavenly realm?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.620 line:93%
She committed a crime, was demoted to the human world, and is being punished.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.530 line:93%
What kind of punishment?

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:03.830 line:93%
Living a miserable life and dying in excruciating pain.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:11.600 line:93%
A punishment in which she has to keep living a cruel life over and over again.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:33.630 line:93%
The most recent is dying from a gunshot in Gyeongseong about 100 years ago.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:39.040 line:93%
Then even if she is reincarnated, she will die a tragic death?

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.350 line:93%
Can't Ma Wang release her from that?

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.650 line:93%
What Ma Wang can do is to become a deity quickly.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.420 line:93%
Only then can he end the eternal cycle of death and rebirth.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.970 line:93%
He will have to become a deity as soon as possible.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:57.950 line:93%
As long as the Great Sage doesn't cause any problems, that should happen.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.040 line:93%
He's been very well-behaved lately because of Geumganggo.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.210 line:93%
That's what worries me.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:07.230 line:93%
That guy is someone who's never well-behaved you know.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.640 line:93%
Hey, Hey, Hey, hurry it up.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.420 line:93%
Light up every candle in every place without any space.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.030 line:93%
All right.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.490 line:93%
- Um...
- What? What? What? What is it now?

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.200 line:93%
Now that I've eaten energy stones I don't really smell rotten anymore though.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.280 line:93%
Hey, for someone who's supposed to be behind a screen smelling incense

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.460 line:93%
and laying inside a nailed shut coffin right now,

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.980 line:93%
lighting candles is living a life of luxury.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.180 line:93%
Yes, it is a luxury.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.910 line:93%
I'll light the candles with all my might!

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.490 line:93%
That's the spirit.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.560 line:93%
Say, it seems like your voice has gotten more peppy.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.730 line:93%
After consuming energy from the World Cup cheers my voice has gotten nice and lively.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.020 line:93%
Ma Wang gave that to you, huh?

00:36:54.790 --> 00:37:00.050 line:93%
That's right. We should share with each other and live well in harmony.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:05.220 line:93%
<i>[Gyeongseong (old name of Seoul) 1930 VIP Film Screening Event]</i>

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.160 line:93%
We're doing the last check-up before tomorrow's screening.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.750 line:93%
The film has been preserved very well.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:21.180 line:93%
Where will the film be displayed after the screening event?

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:29.720 line:93%
Right here. We will be placing a write-up of Chairman Woo Hwi's profile next to it.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:35.780 line:93%
Instead of here, I feel that placement over there would be better though.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.990 line:93%
But that's-

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.220 line:93%
Ah, I apologize.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:50.000 line:93%
This is an area where we display artifacts that have been donated by Korea Foundation.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.050 line:93%
Is that so?

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:55.850 line:93%
The foundation director's household is that of a highly reputable and esteemed independence activist.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:00.530 line:93%
They're very meaningful items, so we can't move them to another location.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:04.310 line:93%
If that's so, I understand.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.160 line:93%
Yes, President.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.730 line:93%
Just a minute.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.320 line:93%
Yes.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:22.840 line:93%
Director, you know about the rumors going around on the internet about Korea Foundation, right? About an intrusion?

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:28.600 line:93%
- It's a conspiracy.
- A security officer wrote that he saw a ghost after trying to open it.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.590 line:93%
Don't speak such nonsense. There's nothing wrong with our museum's items.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:37.410 line:93%
Go and prepare for the film screening event!

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.830 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.960 line:93%
<i>There's a rumor that he saw a ghost.</i>

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.480 line:93%
Do you wish to know who I am?

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.950 line:93%
You! You!

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:23.690 line:93%
You know who I am.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.430 line:93%
I have to get rid of people who know me.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.840 line:93%
Stop.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.290 line:93%
Little girl.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:46.300 line:93%
Is it a ghost lingering to an antique?

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:54.130 line:93%
I hear that's an item from the home of a highly esteemed independence activist.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:04.770 line:93%
Yet why did a Japanese girl come out of there?

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.750 line:93%
Little girl.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.240 line:93%
She ran away into there...!

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.160 line:93%
This is botherome...

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.910 line:93%
What?

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:02.200 line:93%
A Japanese girl wearing a red kimono went into this film?

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.570 line:93%
Yes.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.820 line:93%
Tomorrow is the film screening.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.400 line:93%
After having invited all those humans for the screening, while the film is showing,

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.420 line:93%
What if that girl comes out?

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.490 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:19.910 line:93%
I guess I'll have to go into the film and get that little girl. What did you say she looked like?

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:23.840 line:93%
I made a drawing of her.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.950 line:93%
This looks as if it was drawn with a dog's paws.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.900 line:93%
- Oh, right. They actually are dog's paws.
- I apologize.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.210 line:93%
I would need Sam Jang in order to lure her and catch her.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.470 line:93%
Call Sam Jang.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.730 line:93%
- Is this your favorite movie?
- Yes.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.880 line:93%
But I've never seen it at the movie theater.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.710 line:93%
It's a release, but tonight's the last showing.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:59.700 line:93%
I'm really glad I'm going to get to watch it.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:04.680 line:93%
There's a lot of time left. Want to watch another movie while we wait?

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.770 line:93%
Is there a movie you want to watch?

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.820 line:93%
Let's see...

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:15.160 line:93%
This one looks great. It must be a movie with a warm storyline. It has little clothing.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.510 line:93%
I like movies with warm stories.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.550 line:93%
Do you think they're wearing little clothes because it has a warm storyline?

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.590 line:93%
They're probably wearing little because it's has a warm storyline.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:28.290 line:93%
I was born from a volcano, so I like warm atmospheres like this, you see.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:31.790 line:93%
I'm feeling hot because of you.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.080 line:93%
It's warm and nice.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.360 line:93%
What a nuisance. Why is he calling again?

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.570 line:93%
<i>[Lucifer Entertainment]</i>

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.830 line:93%
Why are you calling us for this? It's simple. Just burn it.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:55.890 line:93%
I already told you. I need this film for the screening event tomorrow.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:58.670 line:93%
But you can't play it in front of so many people.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.470 line:93%
No matter how I think of it, I think it's best to cancel the screening and burn it.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:06.760 line:93%
That's not possible. This film is the deciding factor for Ma Wang to receive his presidential medal.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.620 line:93%
- Without this, they won't give you the medal?
- I'm sure they would give it.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.570 line:93%
But, if I go to receive the award after burning the film I donated,

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.800 line:93%
wouldn't that be disgraceful?

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.750 line:93%
They'll badmouth him for reaping the rewards and then ditching.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:23.110 line:93%
Or they might spread gossip that this was planned from the start just so he could get the award.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:27.920 line:93%
After being so happy that you're getting the award, it looks like you're going to get a ton of criticism.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:36.330 line:93%
That's why I'm saying we need to go in the film and get the kid out before the film screening.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.510 line:93%
I think you will need to go in, Sam Jang.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.890 line:93%
Okay.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:45.670 line:93%
Damn, we have to go watch a movie, but it looks like we're going to be watching this out-dated film instead.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.760 line:93%
You stay out here.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.110 line:93%
I'm not taking Son Oh Gong with me. Last time when we went into the portrait,

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.550 line:93%
you locked up our Oh Gong in there.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.060 line:93%
You might do that again, so Ma Wang should come with me this time.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:12.110 line:93%
That's right. Our Oh Gong will not go in.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:19.680 line:93%
Come out within an hour. Then you'll be able to watch the movie you like. I'll wait.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.290 line:93%
Well... all right.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:28.120 line:93%
Hurry and get ready.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.100 line:93%
Oh, look at that quality. I'm already bored.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.240 line:93%
Oh, there they are.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.100 line:93%
They made it inside well I see.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:01.730 line:93%
The film is an hour long. They'll need to find her and come out before it's over.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:03.890 line:93%
She will come out before then.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:07.710 line:93%
You see, our Sam Jang has to go watch a movie with me.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.790 line:93%
Good.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:45.410 line:93%
We're inside the film's recorded length of an hour.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:49.540 line:93%
If you mess anything up, it'll ruin the invaluable filmstrip so

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.800 line:93%
so please be careful.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.000 line:93%
<i>Lee Soo Il and Shim Soon Ae</i>

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.670 line:93%
So there were movies at this time as well?

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.840 line:93%
Ah, it's Lee Soo Il and Shim Soon Ae.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.380 line:93%
During this time, they were silent films, but the silent-film narrators were spectacular.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.870 line:93%
"Therefore, Lee Soo Il and Shim Soon Ae

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:21.320 line:93%
"crossed the line they shouldn't have." Hah!

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.520 line:93%
What do you think? Do you want to stop by the theater real quick?

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.390 line:93%
There is no time. We must hurry.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:31.450 line:93%
You must be in a hurry, because of the movie you're supposed to watch out there.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.270 line:93%
Since it's a movie I like.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.530 line:93%
What did you say the little girl looks like?

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.160 line:93%
A little girl wearing a red kimono about this tall.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.930 line:93%
It probably won't be of much help, but...

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.720 line:93%
This is a sketch Secretary Ma made.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.030 line:93%
We'll be able to find her with this then.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.810 line:93%
How can you recognize her with a picture drawn with a dog's paw?

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:04.810 line:93%
The defining features are very clear. A flower printed kimono, a short bob haircut,

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:09.850 line:93%
A round face, big eyes, and a mole here.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.630 line:93%
You're really quite amazing.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:17.850 line:93%
A flower printed red kimono like this should have been quite expensive during this time period.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.420 line:93%
For now, should we look for a store that sells Kimonos?

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.560 line:93%
That's a good idea. In this time period's Gyeongseong street,

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.160 line:93%
there was a kimono shop somewhere.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.710 line:93%
Probably at the end of this street.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:36.370 line:93%
It's a bit of a walk so let's take the tram.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.150 line:93%
Ah, here it comes now.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.810 line:93%
Ma Wang! Ma Wang!

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:23.240 line:93%
I'm sorry, but just go. I'll follow you later.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.100 line:93%
When in danger, just call Son Oh Gong.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.830 line:93%
It was definitely her.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:02.680 line:93%
Excuse me. What year and day is it right now here in Gyeongseong?

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.250 line:93%
It's Moo In Nyeon, first month, sixth day.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.020 line:93%
Ah, yes.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:13.080 line:93%
Moo In Nyeon... that means it's 1938...

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.010 line:93%
She died in 1939, so itâs one year before her death.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:47.880 line:93%
Ma Wang said that it seemed like you learned to dance when you were alive.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.850 line:93%
This is our dance practice studio.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.870 line:93%
Is coming here making you remember anything?

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.750 line:93%
Just a really strong feeling of longing.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.990 line:93%
Think about it more carefully.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:07.150 line:93%
I'll go get you another energy stone. Wait here.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:30.140 line:93%
<i>â« I want you to pick me up. Pick me, pick me, pick me up. â«</i>

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:37.640 line:93%

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.380 line:93%
<i>â« I want you to pick me up. â«</i>

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:56.290 line:93%
<i>â« I want you to pick me up. â«</i>

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:59.960 line:93%
Is that me when I was alive?

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:04.190 line:93%
Who are you?

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.470 line:93%
Who are you?

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.230 line:93%
Are you a trainee?

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:17.140 line:93%
You don't know the rules? Trainees aren't allowed in here.

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.600 line:93%
I'm dead tired, so just get out.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.060 line:93%
And throw this away on your way out.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:32.040 line:93%
What is with the smell?

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.040 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.690 line:93%
Where do you think you're spraying that? It'll leave an odor! Get out!

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:41.990 line:93%
You're pissing me off to death.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:45.740 line:93%
If you keep talking about death like that, it's possible you might really die.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.370 line:93%
You're so unbelievable I could die.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:54.420 line:93%
Get out. A trainee should get their butt out of an artist's practice room.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.650 line:93%
Hey. what's wrong with you?

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:02.000 line:93%
I didn't even push you that hard. Why are you falling over?

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.340 line:93%
Hey.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:20.190 line:93%
What is going on? Did she really... die?

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:25.350 line:93%
Bu Ja!

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:30.070 line:93%
PK. I must've killed a person. What do I do?

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.150 line:93%
That is... Hey!

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:43.640 line:93%
Bu Ja, you shouldn't play around with people.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.750 line:93%
Her, she is full of bad manners.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.240 line:93%
She even makes a dead person angry.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:52.140 line:93%
What do we do about her?

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:59.800 line:93%
We're going say Alice drank too much with me, so she's  a confused mess about what happened today. Got it?

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:04.210 line:93%
Bu Ja, you remembered something from when you were alive?

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:10.040 line:93%
A memory of dancing while looking at myself in a mirror came to me.

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.930 line:93%
Do you think I was a dancer?

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.520 line:93%
I'll look into whether there were any missing persons among the dancers.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.130 line:93%
Why do you think I died?

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:23.010 line:93%
You didn't die a natural death but was murdered.

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:26.130 line:93%
Your death probably wasn't pretty.

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:32.910 line:93%
We don't know what might come to light when you get your memories back. Are you prepared for that?

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.270 line:93%
I... need some air for a sec.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.110 line:93%
You mean pig.

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:50.850 line:93%
There are times when being cold like in cold pig's feet (food dish) is needed.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:57.400 line:93%
Let's not cry. Let's wait until they shut the coffin lid on me.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.940 line:93%
<i>Burying a corpse is what I hate most in this world.</i>

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.510 line:93%
<i>Hyungnim! The body is gone!</i>

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.700 line:93%
<i>We just need to say we buried her well.</i>

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:39.460 line:93%
<i> Your death probably wasn't pretty. </i>

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:47.440 line:93%
This is it?

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.820 line:93%
Hey, dog secretary.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.290 line:93%
You said the girl looked to be around eight years old, right?

00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:03.460 line:93%
Yes. It was a young Japanese girl.

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:07.720 line:93%
If she's an evil spirit, then it means she died around eight years of age.

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.430 line:93%
Then who is this old lady?

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.190 line:93%
<i>[Artifact Donor Profile: Kang Myeong Ja

<i>[History at the Korean Foundation]</i>

It's the same person.

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:29.900 line:93%
If that young girl lived until she got this old...

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.990 line:93%
Then who was the one that went into the film?

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.890 line:93%
Miss Akiko. Miss Akiko. Miss.

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:42.950 line:93%
Please don't run. Miss Akiko.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.060 line:93%
They said that the daughter in this home wears a red kimono.

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:04.310 line:93%
Excuse me, but who might you be?

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:06.170 line:93%
- Um...
- Ahhh

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:09.620 line:93%
You must be a guest hear to offer your congratulations.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.810 line:93%
Yes.

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:12.970 line:93%

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:19.330 line:93%
You're the daughter of Lord Nakamura, right?

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:20.700 line:93%
Ah yes.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:26.070 line:93%
Lord Nakamura received a medal of honor from the emperor just like our master did, didn't he?

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.050 line:93%
Ah...yes.

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:35.620 line:93%
It's really quite impressive for a Joseon (old name for Korea) person to receive an award from the emperor.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:42.410 line:93%
Excuse me, there's a girl that's about eight years old in this home, isn't there? Wearing a red kimono?

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:48.670 line:93%
You mean Miss Akiko? She's been very into Hide-and-Seek lately so she keeps hiding.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.020 line:93%
A honored guest is here.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.350 line:93%
- Please wait here a moment.
- Having received a medal of honor from the emperor

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:59.740 line:93%
means we will be able to serve Japan even more.

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:04.040 line:93%
Congratulations!

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.990 line:93%

My husband. My child.

I have to kill him.

Next time, drop by my store.

In the end, you're

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:01.370 line:93%
going to get kill that Japanese man, aren't you?

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.380 line:93%
And

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:11.100 line:93%
You're going to get killed while being chased.

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.520 line:93%
I know.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.990 line:93%

Don't touch it.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.810 line:93%
My treasure is hidden in there.

You can't touch it.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.870 line:93%
- So it was you?
- Do you know who I am?

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:38.750 line:93%
- Akiko.
- That's right, I am Akiko.

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:41.740 line:93%
You're Korean, I mean, a person of Joseon.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:45.840 line:93%
Why are you pretending to be Japanese? What's your real name?

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:53.980 line:93%
I'm no longer a Joseon person.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:58.250 line:93%
My father even received an award from the emperor.

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.220 line:93%
Say it in Korean!

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.830 line:93%
Idiot! I hate you!

- Hello?
- Sam Jang?

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.940 line:93%
Secretary Ma? I've found the girl.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:23.190 line:93%
That's not the soul of a dead girl. It's the live soul of a still living old lady.

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:25.290 line:93%
She's alive?

Got it.

That little kid is an old lady?

I can't be like this.

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:35.190 line:93%
That's a relief.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:43.930 line:93%
Sam Jang was shot by a gun, but how did the Great Sage manage to save her and get her out of there?

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:54.200 line:93%
He went inside and burned that whole world down.

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:53.050 line:93%
The world in which she was shot by a gun and died was burned to extinction

01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:57.090 line:93%
and so he was able to take her out of there safe and sound.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:18.050 line:93%
For Sam Jang's sake,

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.090 line:93%
Son Oh Gong destroyed an entire world.

There will be no damage done to you.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.110 line:93%
Then that's good.

<i>Next time come by my shop.</i>

I guess I'm not going to be able to go back and find her again.

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:37.580 line:93%
Yes, thank you.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.750 line:93%
<i>She's here!</i>

Kang Myeong Ja, born in 1930.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.060 line:93%
She received an Order of Cultural Merit today.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.490 line:93%
What did she do that was so great that she deserves a medal?

Our household is still as prosperous as ever.

In the past,

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:09.020 line:93%
I was a member of a family that received a medal of honor from the emperor of Japan

named Akiko.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:15.740 line:93%
Now I'm someone that's received Korea's Order of Cultural Merit

No?

CEO, this is the first time I've seen you do something like this. I think you've changed.

I'll treat you tomorrow. Tomorrow.

Boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend though.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:43.470 line:93%
That guy who's protecting you. You tell with just a glance that he likes you.

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:49.310 line:93%
He's not my boyfriend. But it is true that he likes me.

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:53.120 line:93%
Isn't it that you like him?

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.920 line:93%
Me?

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.730 line:93%
It looked like you really really like him.

01:13:55.730 --> 01:14:00.160 line:93%
It seems obvious considering you wait for him to come every day.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.230 line:93%

We were supposed to be watching a movie so why did you call me here?

I don't want to watch a movie with you.

What's this about again? What's so bad about it?

01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:18.410 line:93%
Because I like it.

I like being with you who says you'll do everything for me.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:32.220 line:93%
So I feel like the you that tells me you love me is going to make me end up loving you too.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.920 line:93%
But you're a fake.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.930 line:93%
I'm too much of a fool so it's tormenting me.

Tormenting you?

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:47.330 line:93%
You said you'd do everything that I want you to do for me, right?

01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:53.520 line:93%
Then you mustn't ever do the things that I don't want.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.650 line:93%
I really don't want to like you.

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:06.520 line:93%
Don't ask me to like you.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:17.330 line:93%
If that's what you want, then that's what I'll do.

Great Sage, what's with all this?

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:11.960 line:93%
You're here, Ma Wang? Congrats on your award.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.630 line:93%
We should have a party.

Again today, the only one that remembers me is Great Sage I see.

That's just how the other kids are.

At any rate, I do feel a bit bad about drinking by myself.

I brought the best wine out of my entire collection in Sureumdong

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.720 line:93%
to share it with you.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.120 line:93%
You went that far to congratulate me?

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.770 line:93%
It's not just to congratulate you. I have another thing to share with you.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.220 line:93%
What?

01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:53.670 line:93%
I'm being really tormented because of Geumganggo.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:59.120 line:93%
But, you know what? Sam Jang said she's being tormented too.

01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:04.760 line:93%
Love

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.420 line:93%
Because of Geumganggo both Sam Jang and I are feeling torment,

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:15.480 line:93%
in that case, shouldn't you feel torment as well, Ma Wang?

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.120 line:93%
Pardon?

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.210 line:93%
Ma Wang, share in our pain.

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:30.020 line:93%
What did you do?

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.710 line:93%
- In here?
- I put a little something in that wine.

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:38.200 line:93%
A little what?

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.960 line:93%
Sam Jang's blood.

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:51.600 line:93%
Don't joke with me.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.030 line:93%
There's no way I wouldn't be able to recognize the smell of that.

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:02.850 line:93%
That's why I've been filling this house with the scent of lotus flowers all this time.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:22.150 line:93%
<i>Son Oh Gong told me to keep candles lit all day for Ma Wang.</i>

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.600 line:93%
When you weren't paying attention, I took and used the blood that you've been keeping.

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:45.710 line:93%
Sam Jang should be here any minute now. Looks like you're going to get to find out what the effect of that will be.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:54.850 line:93%
The pain of wanting something you can never have, you try having a taste of that too now, Ma Wang.

01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:02.500 line:93%
Looks like she's here.
