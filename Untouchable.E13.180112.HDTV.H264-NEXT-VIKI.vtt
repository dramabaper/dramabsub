00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.460
Hey stop! Stop!

5
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.510
Who was that?

6
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.520
She is Prosecutor Seo I Ra from the Bukcheon Prosecutors Office.

7
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.200
<i>Untouchable
- 13 -</i>

8
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.970
<i>Just 50 years ago, Bukcheon was an extremely poor country village</i>

<i>But now, it's the most prosperous city in the Republic of Korea!</i>

<i>Your fathers and grandfathers have built this place with their blood, sweat, and tears!</i>

11
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.450
This makes no sense.

12
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.610
<i>The car was in the parking lot yesterday and today and then he left 40 minutes ago.</i>

13
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.980
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

14
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.870
<i>I would never work for anyone other than mayor Jang Beom Ho.</i>

15
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.360
<i>Yes.</i>

16
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.490
<i>I would kill a person if he asked me to.</i>

17
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.860
What's up?

18
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.410
I definitely saw it with my own eyes, but I just can't believe it.

19
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.330
I felt that I should tell you anyway.

20
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.560
I saw your dead father.

21
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.870
I wasn't dreaming and it wasn't a ghost. I was in my right mind and I clearly saw your father.

22
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.940
The former mayor Jang Beom Ho is alive.

23
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.790
What do you mean you saw my father?

24
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.570
My father is dead and we had his funeral.

25
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.120
But I saw him, even though he is supposed to be dead.

26
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.670
Are you sure it wasn't someone who just looked like him?

27
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.370
After I got back, I checked his old videos and pictures.

28
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.660
There is no mistaking is was him.

29
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.870
Where?

30
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.790
At the airport. I saw him while I was chasing Joo Tae Seop.

31
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.350
Joo Tae Seop?

32
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.800
He was with Joo Tae Seop.

33
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.770
Yes, mother.

34
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.750
Come home early today.

35
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.390
I have some work to do today.

36
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.860
Today is your father's birthday.

37
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.990
This is the first birthday since his death. Let's have a family meal together.

38
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.090
I understand. I'll be there.

39
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.190
Were you the only one that saw my father?

40
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.690
Yes.

41
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.790
I still can't believe that your father is gone.

42
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.040
I feel like he might just appear all of a sudden.

43
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.240
The house feels so empty and lonely.

44
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.150
What's the point in thinking about a dead person? Forget him.

45
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.600
Is that easy for you guys?

46
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.400
But then again, none of you remembered today was his birthday.

47
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.290
No matter how much he was lacking, he was still your father. Your father.

48
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.860
Mother, hyung was the last person to see father alive, right?

49
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.260
Yes, Gi Seo saw him last. Why?

50
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.550
I was just curious about how he looked at his final moment.

51
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.690
Just curious?

52
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.120
You don't seem to have even the slightest bit of guilt about not being there when father was on his deathbed.

53
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.330
Father came to see me just before he passed away.

54
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.380
Your father did? What did he say?

55
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.800
He was worried a lot about the region and expressed a lot of regret, unlike himself.

56
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.320
Maybe he sensed that he would be going soon.

57
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.750
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come to you and showed you his weak side.

58
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.350
Did he talk about anything else?

59
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.080
He worried a lot about you in particular.

60
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.270
What was he worried about?

61
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.300
What's the point in talking about that now since father is dead? It doesn't mean anything.

62
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.150
Tell me now, what did he say?

63
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.200
Gi Seo, your father worried about you because he cared for you.

64
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.170
And like Joon Seo said, what point is there in bringing it up now?

65
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.570
He's already gone. Let's just focus on the good things.

66
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.470
Hello in-law.

67
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.520
Hello. What brings you here so unexpectedly?

68
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.240
Today is Beom Ho's birthday.

69
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.880
I thought you would have a difficult time being on your own. I came to offer some comfort.

70
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.990
Thank you.

71
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.770
You haven't eaten, right? Please have a seat.

72
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.560
Sure.

73
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.800
How nice it would be if Beom Ho was here with us. It's really unfortunate.

74
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.930
It's so regrettable.

75
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.560
He still has so much work to do.

76
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.810
Which hospital is it?

77
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.400
Dong Pa Hospital...

78
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.980
Do you happen to know why Dr. Yoo Jae Sung suddenly switched hospitals?

79
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.160
Really?

80
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.010
I understand. Thank you.

82
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.750
Meet Ito again and tell him my wishes.

83
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.150
Okay. I understand.

84
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.410
But I don't think it will be easy to convince him.

85
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.970
I don't think we'll be able to stop drugs from coming into Bukcheon.

86
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.130
Then kill Ito.

87
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.670
There was one time I wondered if father was still alive.

88
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.430
Father's voice...

89
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.820
Kill Ito.

90
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.670
Beom Ho was always the object of my envy.

91
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.240
When I was young, it was my dream to live like Beom Ho.

92
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:41.020
I think in high school once, Beom Ho came back from a trip to Japan wearing a suit.

93
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.140
I wanted to wear it so badly.

Harimoto Ichiro

95
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.090
I even secretly tried it on.

96
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:25.610
Now that I think about it, I guess I knew Beom Ho the longest.

97
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.600
Yes, he relied on you the most when he was alive.

98
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:37.420
No, it's the other way around. I owe Beom Ho so much.

99
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.650
I'm very sorry.

100
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:46.680
I'm also sorry that my daughter hasn't been able to bear you a grandson.

101
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:55.220
Gi Seo, I will pay back to you everything I owed your father.

102
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.930
I will think of you as Beom Ho

103
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:06.770
By the way, I was really shocked on my way in.

104
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.190
Is Beom Ho alive?

105
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:29.000
Joon Seo looks so much like Beom Ho that I mistook him for his father.

106
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.940
I do not resemble my father.

107
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.900
No. You give off the same vibe.

108
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.250
I can sense Beom Ho's presence in a way no one else can.

109
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.810
Beom Ho is alive.

110
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.230
Under the name of Jang Joon Seo.

111
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.380
Oh, well. Can't be helped. I'll call you again.

112
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.150
He says he can't reveal the original recording file.

113
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.040
He can't give me any information about the reporter either.

<i>The police. Don't you trust the police?</i>

135
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.580
You're right. They're similar.

136
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.280
Joo Tae Seop was released from prison long time after Father passed away.

137
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.710
He spend eight years in prison.

138
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.230
Then...

139
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.710
It means Joo Tae Seop spoke to a dead man.

140
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.050
By chance... Do you know a man named Harimoto?

141
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.570
Father sold Heugryeongdo to that man.

142
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.370
Besides that.

143
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.670
I don't know much other than that.

144
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.220
You really don't know anything about your father.

145
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.590
Father never told me anything about anything! How could I know?

146
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.980
Why does Father-in-Law stepping up and...

147
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.210
say things like how Joon Seo takes after Father? I don't know why he's doing that.

148
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:39.210
Right before Father passed away, what do you think he told Joon Seo?

149
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.400
I feel like I know.

150
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.410
What do you know?

151
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.860
If he was suspecting his own death...

152
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.660
Don't you think he would've spoken about his successor?

153
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:04.360
That's right. He probably told Joon Seo to take over.

154
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.860
And that is the reason why I must become the mayor.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:57.580
Prosecutor Seo I Ra... saw him.

161
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.020
He probably told Jang Joon Seo as well.

162
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.170
We'll have to clean up some surroundings that we've been pushing off.

163
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.060
Seeing that he's not answering my phone, I think he's hiding something.

164
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.250
What's even more suspicious is... why did he take the position of the deputy director of Dongpa Hospital?

165
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.380
Considering medical positions, he didn't even serve as a manager...

166
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.930
But to be promoted to a deputy director is extremely unconventional.

167
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.470
I'm sure we'll get our answer when we meet and ask him.

168
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.050
He won't tell us easily.

169
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.770
He tasted backend deals.

170
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.640
There's no reason he'd deny an offer that is much better.

171
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.700
There's something I realized the hard way.

172
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.890
Sincerity isn't enough to move one's heart.

173
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.870
Don't jump to conclusions. Sincerity works on some people.

174
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.950
Which floor does that doctor live on?

175
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.140
On the 13th floor.

176
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.760
Are you okay?

177
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.180
By chance, is he...

178
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.180
<i>May I take him to the morgue?</i>

179
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.560
He's the doctor. He's still alive. Call 911.

180
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.150
Okay.

181
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.960

I'm the son of Former Mayor Jang Beom Ho. I'll ask you only one thing.

199

Did my father pass away that day for sure?

They killed Yoo Jae Seong in order to hide that fact.

Now, everything I was stuck on can be explained.

Jung Yoon Mi is spreading words about your extramarital affair.

216
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.730
I think it's because of Yoo Na Na's testimony in the courtroom.

217
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.170
She knows too much.

218

Even about suing you for sexual assault at Saju.

219

Can I do whatever I want to?

220
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.110
No, I will deal with Yoo Na Na.

No.

Are you going to meet her?

224
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.130
Even if I don't meet with her personally, I have a way to deal with her.

225
00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:09.080
Do you trust that woman?

226
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.730
Don't trust her. Trust...

228

That extramarital affair rumor... Did you spread that, Assemblyman Kim?

229
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.900
It was done for you.

230

Everyone will think that I did it.

231

If you feel too burdensome about it, I'll see to it that it was revealed by another source...

232

No, an affair is also a crime.

233
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.340
I fought against crime all my life.

234
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.300
It suits my image as the former police chief.

235
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.230
A criminal who maintains a sexual relationship with another woman when he has his own family...

236
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:12.300
I can't let such a person become the Bukcheon Mayor.

237

That's right, but why did you change your mind suddenly?

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.100
and who killed them after going into Heugryeongdo?

319
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.990
That's why you were fired.

320
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.800
Why do you question the orders from your superiors?

321
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.340
Just do what you're told to do.

322
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.670
I wasn't fired, I quit myself.

323
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.780
Stop it guys.

324
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.800
Team Leader Jang is the most desperate among us. Just trust and follow him.

325
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.970
I'm going to go to the station and get some files.

326
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.350
- You guys get on your feet and search.
- Where to?

327
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.600
How many years have you worked as a detective? Figure it out, man.

328
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.390
You should at least set the direction for us to run or crawl!

329
00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:57.130
Ah, so frustrating! Seriously!

330
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.820
Hey, if I rebel, do you want to follow me?

331
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:30.790
Up until now, you and I were fighting for no reason.

332
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.580
You were always the reason.

333
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.830
Father is alive.

334
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.680
Are you in the right state of mind?

335
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.400
I'm going to find our living father.

336
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.630
How did you get to the point of this delusion?

337
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.860
Think about it carefully.

338
00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.550
The things that are impossible unless Father is alive...

339
00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.930
I'm sure they have happened to you as if they were coincidental.

340
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:04.360
You and I both... We were just puppets that Father controlled behind the scenes.

341
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.020
We lost our lives to our father.

342
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.500
Do you really believe it? That father is alive?

343
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.900
I'll find him to show you. Our living father.

344
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.640
If rumours like that spread around, our family is done for.

345
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.450
But why are you following rumours like that?

346
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:34.030
You should block those rumours instead. If you are our family.

347
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.240
You saw it too. Father killed someone.

348
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:44.320
The father who beat Kyung Seok Ahjussi like a dog...

349
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.780
Father is a murderer. I have to find him.

350
00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.100
That was in the past. He is no longer a person of this world.

351
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.600
Even though he's dead, he's still killing people.

352
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.970
Father is alive.

353
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.330
Don't chase after this.

354
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:09.300
Whether he's alive or dead, do not chase after him.

355
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.110
You will ruin our family.

356
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:20.610
If you don't listen to me, I'm going to give up on you as family.

357
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.810
If that's what you want, then go ahead.

358
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:28.830
But you have to remember that is our fate

359
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.970
that father planned ahead for us.

360
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.650
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

361
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.450
- How's Prosecutor Seo?
- She got off work and came home right away.

362
00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.990
Good job.

363
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:03.470
But hyung, what are you going to do about Prosecutor Seo?

364
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.980
What do you mean what will I do about her? I just have to protect her for now.

365
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.390
Prosecutor Seo, is someone who got to this point with her own power

366
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.770
What she said about wanting to become a star prosecutor... it's all a lie.

367
00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.970
She's been cornered into this dangerous situation because of you, Hyung.

368
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:21.290
Don't you have to take some responsibility?

369
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.010
I'll make it up to her later on.

370
00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.960
You're one of two types,

371
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.820
either a bad guy who uses a woman's feelings

372
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.060
or a really bad guy who knows a woman's feelings but pretends not to know.

373
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.780
Go, you punk. Don't say useless things.

374
00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.400
If you're going to live as a bad guy, then just reveal that you're a bad guy.

375
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.870
Don't give her hope.

376
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.130
I'm leaving, I'll enjoy this.

377
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.880
<i>Think about it carefully.</i>

378
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.570
<i>The things that are impossible unless Father is alive...</i>

379
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:13.020
<i>I'm sure they have happened to you as if they were coincidental.</i>

380
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.610
Was it really what Father wanted?

381
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.940
You'll know if you check his signature.

382
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:29.980
<i>Who gave that to you?</i>

383
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.110
<i>If it's difficult to say, then you don't have to.</i>

384
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.760
<i>In any case, you gave me a great weapon.</i>

385
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.360
<i>I have to be thankful to you this time too, right?</i>

386
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.670
<i>I recorded it in order for me to survive. No need to thank me.</i>

387
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:50.380
<i>- You saved me.
- You must become Mayor.</i>

388
00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.050
<i>That's what your father wanted.</i>

389
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.310
Did you look into it?

390
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.080
Where is that doctor right now?

391
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.700
<i>It's been confirmed that he became the deputy director of Dongpa Hospital.</i>

392
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.200
<i>But he has cut off all contact right now.</i>

393
00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.490
Is that so?

394
00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:20.230
<i>There was someone who was asking about that doctor.</i>

395
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.040
Who was it?

396
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.040
<i>Bukcheon Prosecutor's Office, Prosecutor Seo I Ra.</i>

397
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.600
Seo I Ra?

398
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.900
Call me when you get off work.

399
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.670
If you have to go out in the middle of the day, don't forget to go with an investigator.

400
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.860
Do I have to go that far?

401
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.010
Do it. Listen to me. Please.

402
00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:00.840
Also, I hope you can get out of this case as soon as possible.

403
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.950
I also hope you can take your hands off the trial.

404
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.670
You don't have to overreact too much.

405
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:10.200
I'm a prosecutor, and this is part of my job.

406
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.340
I'm telling you to get out of this <i>for</i> me.

407
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.120
I'm not doing this because of you.

408
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.590
For the first time since I became a prosecutor, I've found something I have to do as a prosector.

409
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.150
I'm doing it with you because it's the right thing to do.

410
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:29.260
Our opponent is my father. A lot of people will get hurt.

411
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.930
I have to keep going. This is the path I chose.

412
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.540
Then promise me one thing.

413
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.860
If I tell you to get out of this case again,

414
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.890
get off the case then. This is my request.

415
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.430
I'll call you.

416
00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.170
Yes?

417
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.890
What?

418
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.540
Goo Do Soo, what happened?!

419
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.610
You should have stopped him!

420
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.030
Hey, Heugryeongdo is a place where four out of five detectives came back dead.

421
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.900
What are we going to do if Lee Sung Gyun goes there by himself?!

422
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.140
Of course I stopped him! I told him he would die if he went!

423
00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.310
But he kept saying Joo Tae Seop is there. What can I do?

424
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:30.000
He kept saying we have to get to Heugryeongdo without beating around the bush to catch him! What can I do?

425
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.890
- What did he take to get there?
- Of course he took a boat, would he walk?

426
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.290
Can you crack a joke right now? Which boat did he take?

427
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.440
He rented a small boat and drove it himself.

428
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.240
If it gets dangerous, he said he'd just sail around and come back.

429
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.930
Why isn't he back yet?

430
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.870
Hey, what do we do?

431
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.000
Get a boat.

432
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.300
No, that's too dangerous.

433
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.850
We have to save him. We have to save him no matter what.

434
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:02.940
Wait, that boat over there!

435
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.990
Prosecutor Seo, you have to stop Joon Seo.

436
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.060
He does too many dangerous things.

437
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.600
Well, that's not something I can control.

438
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.110
He says our father is alive.

439
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.820
I don't know where that's coming from.

440
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:49.540
Do you know? Why he started to think of that?

441
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.770
There must be a reason.

442
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.180
Did someone see him? My father?

443
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.670
That...

444
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.590
Who was it? The person who saw him.

445
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.710
Your father will know.

446
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.660
He also saw that person.

447
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.240
Please tell the person who saw my father what I'm about to say.

448
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:23.130
If he spread such a false rumor again, he'll get hurt.

449
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.600
Bukcheon is surprisingly a dangerous place.

450
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.420
I'm sure you know, Prosecutor.

451
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:41.150
I couldn't even get close to Heugryeongdo. The coast guard butted in all of a sudden.

452
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.600
Saying it's a restricted area. I'm speechless...

453
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.620
Consider yourself lucky. The coast guard saved your life, man.

454
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.790
You worked hard all this time.

455
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:55.630
I think it will be good for both of us for you to leave us at this point.

456
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:04.040
I'll apologize for acting on my own.

457
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.810
- But...
- I'm not saying you did wrong, Detective Lee. It's just that...

458
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.330
Please understand me.

459
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.250
You're not suited for this case, Detective Lee.

460
00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:18.920
Team Leader, he didn't do that without anything thinking.

461
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.220
He is right in one way. So...

462
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.290
Forget it. There's no need for me to stay when he says he doesn't need me.

463
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:34.140
This is good. I really hated working for one person.

464
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.320
Hyung. I don't think this is right.

465
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.860
This isn't your style either. He put his life on the line. Why...

466
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.970
Why put his life on the line over that?

467
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.990
Things will become even more dangerous from now on.

468
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.250
If you think your life is in danger, please pull yourself back no matter what.

469
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:15.140
Our opponent is Jang Beom Ho. Live Jang Beom Ho.

470
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:20.230
Live Jang Beom Ho?

471
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.740
Father is alive.

472
00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:31.520
Why would Goo Ja Gyeong support Gi Seo hyung to become the mayor all of a sudden?

473
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:37.350
That's because... he's her husband. Isn't that obvious?

474
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:41.480
Goo Ja Gyeong never thinks of herself as Jang Family's daughter-in-law.

475
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.520
It means there's something she's getting back as a payback when Gi Seo hyung becomes the mayor.

476
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:51.390
You said he gave her the Expo land to Ja Gyeong. They must've compromised over that.

477
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:55.320
That land belongs to NJ Group in reality. It's an empty can.

478
00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.790
Goo Ja Gyeong, that shrewd fox stepped on s*** this time for sure.

479
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.510
The Expo land has lots of problems.

480
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.100
It's a land that can be tied up again as a greenbelt land if corruptions were revealed.

481
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.960
But why would they fight over it so much?

482
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.970
Even the Japanese real estate company has jumped in.

483
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:20.370
The way I see it, NJ Group guys were scammed by Beom Ho hyung at the last minute.

484
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:27.040
Think about it. If the land was that important, would he have used that land as collateral to get money right before he died?

485
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.110
The problem is Former President Goo Yong Chan is also quite interested in that land.

486
00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:34.300
Of course!

487
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.630
If the corruption behind it is revealed, Goo Yong Chan is directly connected to it.

488
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.140
There are three possibilities.

489
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.030
There's a nuclear bomb that will blow up and kill everyone in that land.

490
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:51.420
Or golden nuggets are buried there. Or both.

492
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:05.420
It's the article that was going to get published today. I stopped it.

493
00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.660
Is it a fortunate thing from the NJ Group's position?

494
00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:15.440
If the article is published and becomes an issue, that land won't be worth 500 billion won.

495
00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:23.900
The reason you're showing me this is because you can always publish the article if you ever change your mind.

496
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.970
That's what you're saying, right?

497
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:30.440
Of course, NJ isn't the only party who will lose out if this ever got published.

498
00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.510
If the circumstances change, that land will be worth 500 billion won...

499
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.590
No... It might become even more valuable.

500
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.840
Are you suggesting we compromise?

501
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.380
My father-in-law has been protecting that land from previous generations.

502
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:52.690
For that land to be turned over to a Japanese corporation... I don't think that's our rightful duty toward him.

503
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:58.450
I understand. I'll discuss it with Chairman Harimoto.

504
00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.930
What is it?

505
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:09.730
It's a package for Chairman Harimoto of NJ Headquarters of Japan.

506
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.360
Okay.

Goo Yong Chan...

513
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:54.280
I received a call from the coast guard early this morning. They saw a suspicious movement.

514
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.700
Why are you telling me that?

515
00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:02.190
He's one of the guys who is helping Director Jang Joon Seo.

516
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.270
A guy helping Jang Joon Seo?

517
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:09.660
A few detectives he used to work with are acting as Director Jang Joon Seo's hands and feet.

518
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:14.280
Arrest all of them and put them away.

519
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:19.640
But the reason that's not so easy to do is that they're all detectives and...

Director Jang Joon Seo's got their back.

Joo Tae Seop threatened him.

576
00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:23.390
Detective Lee had no choice but to send you all there even though he knew it was a trap.

577
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:29.290
He ran to you guys after securing those two people's safety.

578
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:35.030
So, you're saying he died trying to save us, huh?

579
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:41.570
What kind of sucky situation is this?

580
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:45.890
I always picked on him.

581
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:49.270
Why did he have to die fussing all over like that?

582
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:56.220
Who is it? The person who ordered Joo Tae Seop? Who is it exactly?

583
00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:01.660
Say something. So that we can relieve that guy's resentment.

584
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:07.460
The fact that police force was used... It means it's connected to Chief No Ji Hwan.

585
00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:12.700
That means President Jang Gi Seo is behind it.

586
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:16.130
Joo Tae Seop was hiding in the midst of the police officers.

587
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:19.650
Joo Tae Seop is the one who killed Lee Seong Gyoon.

588
00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:22.570
Joo Tae Seop, that a**hole...

589
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.140
When I saw Former Mayor Jang Beom Ho, Joo Tae Seop was with him.

590
00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:33.040
It's probably more correct that he receives order from Former Mayor Jang Beom Ho rather than President Jang Gi Seo.

591
00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:37.680
Why is everything so complicated? Make it simple.

592
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.430
Who's the one we need to catch and kill?

593
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:43.590
Is it your brother? Or your father, Team Leader?

594
00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.730
- You're speaking too rashly.
- Am I wrong?

595
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:54.170
Lee Seong Gyoon is right. We shouldn't beat around the bush, but follow the essence.

596
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:58.160
Who is it? The moron we need to catch and kill.

597
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.860
I have the biggest responsibility.

598
00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:07.360
I'm the one who pulled in Lee Seong Gyoon. And I'm the one who created this situation.

599
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:11.070
That's not what I'm asking! Where are you going?

600
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:15.050
Detective Goo, please not today... Please...

601
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.990
Why are you doing this?

602
00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:37.630
I will take care of your family for the rest of my life.

603
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.830
That's the only thing I can do to ask for forgiveness.

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:44.670
I don't even know who you are.

605
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:49.050
I'm... Lee Seong Gyoon and...

606
00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:57.600
Lee Seong Gyoon's father... I'm the son of the murderer who killed them both.

607
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.570
Please don't forgive my father.

608
