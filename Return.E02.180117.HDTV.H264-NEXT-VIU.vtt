00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.031
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
Why did you want us to meet?

3
00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:22.640
There's no particular reason.

4
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.309
It's just us.

5
00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.709
He's in a bad mood because we are making his wife work.

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.020
Why don't you at least pretend to be helping?

7
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.050
I can't be of help to her.

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.919
You said it yourself...

9
00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:39.989
that you can smell paint from the food I cook with my hands.

10
00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.230
Hey, did you guys start already?

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.169
- Hi, you're here. - Hello.

12
00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:49.029
What? How did you get in?

13
00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:51.569
The passcode is In Ho's birthday.

14
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.370
Hey, it seems like you still haven't changed it.

15
00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.340
Come on. You should change it.

16
00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.309
Jin Joo.

17
00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.910
Come on. Why don't you say hello to me?

18
00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:03.849
Are you too pretty to say hi?

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.550
Yes.

20
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.560
- Gosh. - Goodness.

21
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.619
- You are pretty indeed. - Well done.

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.429
I'm in the bathroom.

23
00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.569
I know.

24
00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:32.239
What is it?

25
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.479
Come on.

26
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.550
Hey. You little witch.

27
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.190
Did you get a new nose job?

28
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.530
Gosh, you're the only one who recognizes the difference.

29
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.869
I bet Tae Suk wouldn't recognize even if my whole face changed.

30
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.209
I know.

31
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.910
Gosh, you know...

32
00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.650
you should have married me, right?

33
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.919
We make a good team.

34
00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.849
We are compatible.

35
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.560
In what other area...

36
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.359
are you saying that we are compatible?

37
00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.199
Oh, my goodness. Do you hear yourself? Seriously.

38
00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.199
It's really upsetting.

39
00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.440
It's really hard to forget about that.

40
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.109
- I mean it. - Hey.

41
00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.609
- Come here. - No.

42
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.240
You shouldn't have a vague memory of that event.

43
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.410
- Of course I remember. - Gosh.

44
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.750
- I understand. - Goodness.

45
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.579
Hold on. Let me refresh your memory quickly.

46
00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.720
- Gosh. - It won't take long.

47
00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.419
It will only take a minute.

48
00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.329
Gosh.

49
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.740
Honey, should we open up another bottle of wine?

50
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.109
Sure.

51
00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.049
- Hey. - What?

52
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.150
I'll have some white wine.

53
00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.049
Sure.

54
00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.160
Are we expecting another guest?

55
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.000
If you're not going to be polite, at least try not to show it.

56
00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.430
Learn it from Jin Joo.

57
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.840
Look at her pretending like nothing happened.

58
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.900
Let me get that.

59
00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.139
What is he going on about?

60
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.710
Wipe your lips.

61
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.949
- Is it still on my face? - You little... Gosh.

62
00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.349
Come on, Jin Joo. You little witch. Unbelievable.

63
00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.560
In Ho, you have a guest.

64
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.630
Let me see who it is.

65
00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.370
I'm coming.

66
00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.400
Is Na Ra inside?

67
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.940
Na Ra.

68
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.449
Mi Jung.

69
00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.190
It's nice to meet you, everyone.

70
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.889
I'm glad you're here.

71
00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.219
- This is for you. - Thank you.

72
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.219
Come this way.

73
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.170
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:43.370
What do you mean?

75
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.500
Did you invite her?

76
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.740
Why? I wasn't supposed to?

77
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.009
You should've told me then.

78
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.209
You crazy jerk.

79
00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:51.740
I was just trying to have some fun.

80
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.880
What? "Have some fun"?

81
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.579
It was done out of respect for my best friend...

82
00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:57.850
who got his mistress move into the town house.

83
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.250
- Let's just say that. - Don't you dare get smart with me.

84
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.550
You're about to hit me.

85
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.319
Between friends,

86
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.759
a friendship is shared, not punches.

87
00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.130
I told you not to get smart with me.

88
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.959
If you're going to have an affair, you shouldn't let this rile you up.

89
00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:12.959
Don't you...

90
00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.269
Don't you dare speak of the affair.

91
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.769
Did I ask her to move?

92
00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:18.440
No, she moved here...

93
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440
You always...

94
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.269
blame other people.

95
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.909
Wherever she lives doesn't change the fact.

96
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.310
You're making it too obvious. At this rate,

97
00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:34.149
you're going to get caught. Okay?

98
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.130
Thank you.

99
00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:52.339
Here.

100
00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:54.509
Thank you.

101
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.310
My gosh, Na Ra is going through a lot of trouble.

102
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.240
She has one more mouth to feed.

103
00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:02.380
I'm sorry, Na Ra.

104
00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.980
Don't say that.

105
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.719
You brought an expensive wine. I should be apologizing.

106
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.490
Here you go.

107
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.459
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

108
00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:19.000
Anyway, what line of work is the new neighbor in?

109
00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.730
You said you run a bar, right?

110
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.540
Yes, I run a wine bar in Cheongdam-dong.

111
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.139
Is that why you look familiar?

112
00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:33.339
I thought for a second that she was In Ho's ex-lover.

113
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.589
I don't think...

114
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.459
I'm In Ho's type.

115
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.600
I mean, Na Ra is... How should I put it?

116
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.630
She's elegantly beautiful.

117
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.800
Tell us.

118
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.839
What do you think of me?

119
00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:13.149
You saw right through me.

120
00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:15.719
You're definitely not my type.

121
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.159
Oh, my! Have you gone mad?

122
00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.659
- I'm sorry! - Do you know how much this is?

123
00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:22.790
- Goodness, how dirty. - Dear me.

124
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.060
Hey, you jerk. Hey.

125
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:32.100
- Mi Jung, this wine is really good. - Please elaborate on...

126
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:34.469
what you just said.

127
00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:41.509
You're vulgar, do whatever you want,

128
00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:44.250
and delude yourself...

129
00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:47.319
that you can charm guys with such qualities.

130
00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:58.899
I'm sorry, Mi Jung.

131
00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:03.069
Please apologize to her. Your joke went out of the line.

132
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.870
In Ho.

133
00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.350
Oh, my stomach.

134
00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:24.860
This is so much fun!

135
00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.790
I didn't know I was so careless.

136
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.130
Exactly.

137
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.700
Joon Hee.

138
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:36.730
Oh, no.

139
00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:39.070
Joon... Joon Hee. Are you okay?

140
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.470
Yes. Sorry. Excuse me.

141
00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:49.549
This is so annoying. What kind of a dinner is this?

142
00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:51.950
What? I like the drama.

143
00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:54.649
Me too. Tae Suk has my vote.

144
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.419
This is so much fun.

145
00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:01.230
Seriously.

146
00:09:52.409 --> 00:09:54.309
I need my drugs.

147
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.279
Snap out of it.

148
00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:01.090
You're already addicted.

149
00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:05.759
Stab me. Stab me, you jerk.

150
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.659
Just send me my drugs.

151
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.200
Your being here is absolutely the worst.

152
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.529
Don't try to weasel your way out of it.

153
00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:46.659
You were acting out of character.

154
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.830
I was so ashamed that I thought I was going to cry.

155
00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.769
- Should I do the dishes? - Don't change the subject.

156
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.179
It was nothing. I just wasn't feeling so good.

157
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.980
Having a stranger there made me more sensitive.

158
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.919
Would you apologize for me?

159
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.549
I hate you.

160
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.360
You can't touch me for the next few days as punishment.

161
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.730
Just hit me instead. Just hit me.

162
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.360
Darn it.

163
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.500
You're such a child.

164
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:25.370
Are you going to sleep once you finish cleaning up?

165
00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:27.740
Yes, I should.

166
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.870
Good.

167
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.409
- I need to step out. - What? This late?

168
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.480
It's raining outside.

169
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.450
Don't ask why. Can you go to sleep first?

170
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.049
Is something really up?

171
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.990
You don't look so good.

172
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.759
Come on. If you look at me so pretty like that,

173
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.529
I can't leave.

174
00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:54.470
Just answer one question. Is it important or serious?

175
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:57.840
It's neither. It's just something...

176
00:11:59.169 --> 00:12:00.340
I need to do.

177
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:03.039
Call me when you're done.

178
00:12:06.179 --> 00:12:07.480
Be careful.

179
00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:11.620
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

180
00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:14.189
- You should get going now. - Goodnight.

181
00:12:23.213 --> 00:12:28.213
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E02 Return "How Could She Suddenly Be Dead?"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

182
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.480
How pretty.

183
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.990
You'll be in trouble if we get into an accident now.

184
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.259
Well, no one would cry for me.

185
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.500
But how would your angelic wife,

186
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.740
who trusts her husband completely, react?

187
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.429
Hey. When you make a joke,

188
00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:29.960
at least someone should enjoy it.

189
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.269
Who enjoyed your joke today?

190
00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:36.669
Tell me!

191
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:44.039
It was enjoyable for me.

192
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.340
And thrilling.

193
00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.210
Move out right now.

194
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.919
- Why should I? - You little...

195
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.519
Will you keep hanging around me like this?

196
00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:56.889
I'm close with Na Ra.

197
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.689
Should I ask her then?

198
00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:04.000
Don't be ridiculous.

199
00:14:07.669 --> 00:14:10.029
What are you doing? Give me that.

200
00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:11.169
Hi, Mi Jung.

201
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:16.840
Goodness.

202
00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:22.279
Why did it get disconnected?

203
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.779
She must've called by mistake.

204
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:34.429
You should smile.

205
00:14:34.889 --> 00:14:36.860
You look cutest when you smile.

206
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.399
Hey.

207
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.669
Hey. If my sleeping with you...

208
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.070
created some misconception that I'll return to you, tell me.

209
00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:53.580
Let's not see each other ever again in any way, shape, or form.

210
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.110
Do you want to protect your wife...

211
00:14:56.409 --> 00:14:57.750
or your family?

212
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.750
Na Ra is my family,

213
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.549
and my family is meaningless without her.

214
00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:04.289
What about me?

215
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.789
Hey. You're just...

216
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.259
Well, you're a toilet. You're like a toilet.

217
00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:13.799
I can let it out whenever I want, and if I don't need it,

218
00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:15.100
I just close...

219
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.380
Fine. Okay. Let's stop.

220
00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:30.880
If you need money, I'll give you money.

221
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.450
- If you need a house, I'll... - Die.

222
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.919
Just die! Just die already!

223
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.220
Die! Die!

224
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.559
Hey!

225
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.659
- Die, you jerk! You scumbag! Die! - Hey.

226
00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:46.230
- Stop it! - Let go!

227
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.500
- What are you doing? - Are you kidding me?

228
00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:54.340
Seriously. What are you trying to pull?

229
00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:56.909
Hey. My gosh.

230
00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.549
Get out.

231
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.939
How could you do this to me?

232
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.809
(One week later, December 4)

233
00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:37.279
So the owner didn't come in today either?

234
00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:38.419
That's right.

235
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.919
How could the owner not come in for days?

236
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:45.559
To be honest,

237
00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:48.689
she was here last time when you came.

238
00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:50.630
But this time, I'm telling you the truth.

239
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.700
She hasn't come in for a week, and we can't even reach her.

240
00:16:55.429 --> 00:16:57.000
Did that happen before?

241
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.740
We couldn't reach her once when she was traveling abroad,

242
00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:02.769
but she never failed to show up without telling us first.

243
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.439
You'd better not be lying.

244
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.249
Hey, Dong Bae. We need to put Yum Mi Jung on the wanted list.

245
00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:22.260
Where did she go? She left her phone off too.

246
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.999
Be careful of driving at night.

247
00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:55.590
What kind of psycho left this here?

248
00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.130
That was so close.

249
00:17:58.499 --> 00:18:00.229
I'm going to...

250
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.070
What is that?

251
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.770
Help! Is anyone out there?

252
00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:17.080
Why is an officer from Seoul interested in a body...

253
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.919
that was found in Paju of the Gyeonggi province?

254
00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:21.590
I was searching for her while investigating a drug case.

255
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.159
She's too young and pretty to have died. How old is she?

256
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.459
She's 38. Her name is Yum Mi Jung.

257
00:18:27.989 --> 00:18:29.189
She has a young face.

258
00:18:29.659 --> 00:18:32.699
She will still be 38 after 10 years.

259
00:18:34.499 --> 00:18:35.999
But what is this?

260
00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.340
These are Roman numerals. 99.

261
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.939
I see.

262
00:18:41.239 --> 00:18:44.080
At least try to keep your manners.

263
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.179
I'm 15 years older than you.

264
00:18:46.179 --> 00:18:47.510
That's nothing to brag about.

265
00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:49.479
Okay, fine. Just tell me the cause of death.

266
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.280
She drowned.

267
00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:55.889
What's interesting is that I found rocuronium in her body.

268
00:18:55.949 --> 00:18:59.090
It's an anesthetic drug that is used in hospitals.

269
00:18:59.189 --> 00:19:01.729
And it was injected in her muscles, not her veins.

270
00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:03.159
What does that mean?

271
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.360
The killer drowned her while her body was slowly being paralyzed.

272
00:19:07.199 --> 00:19:09.229
It means that the killer watched her die.

273
00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:11.570
That's immeasurable rage.

274
00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:15.070
Three of her ribs were broken, but I couldn't find any bleeding.

275
00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:19.040
I think the ribs were broken from the car accident though.

276
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.209
Anything else?

277
00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.510
One of her front teeth was broken.

278
00:19:23.749 --> 00:19:25.620
It could be an interference phenomenon.

279
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.489
It means that the front tooth could have been broken before the murder.

280
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.919
Let me see.

281
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.959
All right.

282
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.760
You're right.

283
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.499
I found only one of her earrings.

284
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:49.040
I found someone else's DNA from her ring and underneath her nails.

285
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.409
This is a pretty clean corpse.

286
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:52.909
When is the time of death?

287
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.310
There's a sign of the corpse being refrigerated.

288
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.919
So I think there will be many errors in assessing the time of death.

289
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.550
Anyway, good luck!

290
00:20:01.749 --> 00:20:02.749
Okay.

291
00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:06.620
(Evidence 1, Evidence 2)

292
00:20:08.689 --> 00:20:09.929
(Evidence 4)

293
00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:11.229
(Evidence 8)

294
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.800
Where does Yum Mi Jung live?

295
00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:17.030
Gosh, this is annoying.

296
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.340
This is going to tarnish the reputation of our townhouse.

297
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.840
The value is going to dive now.

298
00:20:21.439 --> 00:20:25.340
Anyway, we must screen the qualifications of the tenants.

299
00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:27.550
Just like the hearing at the National Assembly.

300
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.080
We must list this as one of the agendas in our meeting.

301
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.120
Please!

302
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.149
Would you please cut it out?

303
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.719
Someone just died. It's not the time to worry about our townhouse.

304
00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:46.429
I feel like I've been slapped in the face while sleeping.

305
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.040
Then what else should we worry about at a time like this?

306
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.699
Hey, am I the only snob here?

307
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.739
This house doesn't look like someone actually lived here.

308
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.709
What a peculiar woman.

309
00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:00.409
Her house looks like a model home.

310
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:03.310
This is a bleak house.

311
00:21:08.649 --> 00:21:11.120
Did you look into Yum Mi Jung's life before she was killed?

312
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.290
Yes, I looked into her credit card statements.

313
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.489
There's one establishment she regularly visited.

314
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.560
Where is that?

315
00:21:17.199 --> 00:21:19.499
You keep the surveillance footage only up to six months ago,

316
00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:21.300
so there's no footage dating before June. Is that right?

317
00:21:21.469 --> 00:21:22.469
Yes, that's right.

318
00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:26.639
In that case, let's start from June.

319
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.340
Stop.

320
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.580
That's her, right?

321
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.340
She's alone.

322
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.510
Please show us the footage on July 17.

323
00:21:36.479 --> 00:21:37.679
(Prince Hotel)

324
00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.949
The footage on the 12th, please.

325
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.020
(Prince Hotel)

326
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.320
And the footage on June 26.

327
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.600
Why does she stay in the same hotel room for three hours alone...

328
00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:55.330
4 to 5 times a month?

329
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.239
Maybe she was with someone that can't be seen at the hotel.

330
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.280
I get the feeling this is going to require my persistence and patience.

331
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.780
If you don't want to stay here all night, keep up the good work.

332
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.360
Let me read you off the dates.

333
00:22:17.389 --> 00:22:19.959
Please make a copy of the footage from the parking lot, elevator,

334
00:22:19.959 --> 00:22:23.030
and everywhere else connected to the rooms on those dates.

335
00:22:47.219 --> 00:22:49.889
Why do you have so many meetings?

336
00:22:51.389 --> 00:22:52.989
Did you drink a lot?

337
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.889
I only had a few.

338
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.300
Oh, right.

339
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.130
You haven't heard, right?

340
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.139
How could you know? I didn't tell you.

341
00:23:12.709 --> 00:23:14.909
It's about that woman who lives in 302.

342
00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:16.780
Mi Jung...

343
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:20.989
is dead.

344
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.489
You're shocked too, right?

345
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.330
When I heard the news, all my limbs started to shake.

346
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.669
The detectives have been coming to the townhouse for several days.

347
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:38.699
They even asked me some questions too.

348
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.709
How could this happen?

349
00:23:45.439 --> 00:23:47.580
Poor Mi Jung. I feel so sorry for her.

350
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:18.909
What's up?

351
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.810
What is it?

352
00:24:22.209 --> 00:24:23.820
- It's dark. Turn on the light. - Don't.

353
00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:25.919
Don't.

354
00:24:27.489 --> 00:24:28.489
What's gotten into you?

355
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.350
Did you have a fight with Na Ra?

356
00:24:31.959 --> 00:24:32.959
Hey.

357
00:24:33.929 --> 00:24:35.459
Where did you get those scratches on your face?

358
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.130
Tae Suk.

359
00:24:38.459 --> 00:24:39.659
Mi Jung...

360
00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:43.939
Mi Jung... Mi Jung...

361
00:24:45.969 --> 00:24:46.969
is dead.

362
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.340
What are you talking about?

363
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.280
- How could she suddenly be dead? - I don't know! I don't know either.

364
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.780
Didn't you meet with her after the dinner on that night?

365
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.919
How... How did you know that?

366
00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:03.090
I talked to her on the phone.

367
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.090
I thought the way she left that dinner was strange,

368
00:25:05.219 --> 00:25:06.419
but she told me you two were going to meet.

369
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.830
After that day,

370
00:25:09.729 --> 00:25:10.899
I never saw her again.

371
00:25:10.899 --> 00:25:13.330
Hey, what's your point?

372
00:25:13.459 --> 00:25:15.800
Don't be so defensive.

373
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.499
I didn't mean anything by it.

374
00:25:19.499 --> 00:25:20.510
No, I'm sorry.

375
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.110
I... I'm just anxious.

376
00:25:42.189 --> 00:25:43.260
Did you find something?

377
00:25:51.969 --> 00:25:54.510
He always showed up in the parking lot...

378
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.939
30 minutes after Yum Mi Jung checked into the hotel.

379
00:25:56.939 --> 00:26:00.649
And he's the only guy who always left the hotel 30 minutes before...

380
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:01.749
she checked out.

381
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.419
Do you think I've been lounging around?

382
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.020
The suitcase we found her in...

383
00:26:07.189 --> 00:26:11.590
is a limited edition of a designer suitcase. Only 50 were sold here.

384
00:26:11.659 --> 00:26:13.219
A serial number is attached to each suitcase too.

385
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.060
Then does it mean we can track the number and find who purchased it?

386
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.229
Yes, I have already requested the brand to find out who bought it.

387
00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:24.040
As soon as the purchaser is found, they'll fax the information to us.

388
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.999
My goodness, Dong Bae.

389
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.110
Great, great. Well done. Good job, Dong Bae.

390
00:26:30.209 --> 00:26:32.310
Goodness, you're awesome.

391
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.749
(Gangdong Precinct)

392
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.560
I'm with the police.

393
00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:54.429
Hi, what brings you here?

394
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.300
Is Mr. Kang In Ho home?

395
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.010
May I ask what this is about?

396
00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:10.479
Mr. Kang In Ho?

397
00:27:11.649 --> 00:27:12.649
Yes.

398
00:27:14.449 --> 00:27:15.590
Do you know Ms. Yum Mi Jung?

399
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760
Mr. Kang In Ho.

400
00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:27.530
You are under arrest for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum.

401
00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:31.199
Wait. Hold on.

402
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.370
What... What is he talking about?

403
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.830
The legal TV show, Return, starts now.

404
00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:10.880
(Return)

405
00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:14.110
I can't tolerate anyone who threatens my family.

406
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.280
He killed her somewhere else.

407
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.249
Stellarium Penthouse.

408
00:28:17.449 --> 00:28:19.219
Get my attorney. I want my attorney!

409
00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:21.350
I'm Mr. Kang In Ho's attorney.

410
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.050
We have to get In Ho out no matter what.

411
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.260
With whom were you at the penthouse?

412
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.590
In Ho's lawyer came to me and asked about that day.

413
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.290
You deleted the video from the dash cam, right?

414
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.499
Let me ask you again. Did you kill Yum Mi Jung?

415
00:28:33.499 --> 00:28:34.530
No.
