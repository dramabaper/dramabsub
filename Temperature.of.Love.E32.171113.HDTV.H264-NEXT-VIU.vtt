Cheers.

(Episode 32)

3
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.969
Mr. Park I think you're...

4
00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.730
perfectly suited for autumn.

5
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.269
You're sentimental and...

6
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.609
Kyung, you're really great at sucking up.

7
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.409
- You like everyone but me, right? - That's right.

8
00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.310
By the way, why isn't anyone singing?

9
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:42.750
Let's sing together.

10
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.850
No. I don't want to.

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.520
I don't like to be forced into doing anything.

12
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:49.149
Okay, fine.

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.090
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.299
("Thorn")

15
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.170
The world doesn't know

16
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.670
About my breakup

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.980
Sadly, it is still the same

18
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.549
The memories of you

19
00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.519
And the past love

20
00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.120
Have become a thorn

21
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.560
- That pierces my heart - Hyun Soo. He can sing.

22
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.590
He can.

23
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.000
Yes. Hyun Soo, do you want to sing?

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.469
Kyung, you should sing.

25
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.530
You're good. You can dance too.

26
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.269
Let me hear you sing.

27
00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:40.569
No, let's sing together.

28
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.879
I'm not going to sing anymore.

29
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.510
You're all just sitting there and doing nothing.

30
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.450
Then I'll sing.

31
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.290
You didn't sing when I asked you to.

32
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.620
("Last Night Story")

33
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.270
Hwangbo!

34
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.169
Kyung!

35
00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.770
Last night I started hating you

36
00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.409
Last night I started loathing you

37
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.449
Watching the spinning party light

38
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.930
- I was hurt alone - I was hurt alone

39
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.300
While my friends

40
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.069
Danced with you

41
00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.669
Holding your hands

42
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.400
Things are slowly getting better.

43
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.610
Thank you so much everyone.

44
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.110
- Good! - Soup!

45
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.909
Why do you always smile?

46
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.949
You don't look well.

47
00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.430
I can tell how you're feeling...

48
00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.629
just by looking at you.

49
00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:46.930
Chef.

50
00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.169
Hello, Ms. Hwangbo.

51
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.810
Did you two have a drink together?

52
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.379
We had a party. To celebrate getting a TV slot.

53
00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.280
It's not confirmed yet.

54
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.449
It's pretty much confirmed, Hyun Soo.

55
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.750
Director Kim said he'd do it.

56
00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.819
It's cold out here. Let's go inside.

57
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.319
You look like you had a drink too.

58
00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.659
Yes, with Good Soup staff because of the website renewal.

59
00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:20.170
Okay. So you two should go upstairs first.

60
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.170
Where are you going?

61
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.670
Well... I have somewhere to go.

62
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.740
Don't go.

63
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.379
I feel sorry.

64
00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:35.310
I know. I feel sorry too.

65
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.680
She didn't have to leave.

66
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.769
Why did you want to see me? You treated me like a ghost earlier.

67
00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.430
Because I can't go home.

68
00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.040
You want to spend the night with me? I'm not ready yet.

69
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.339
This is why...

70
00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.050
- I can't like you. - I was just kidding.

71
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.279
Sit down. Come on.

72
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920
- What do you want to drink? - Sprite.

73
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:16.319
You got it!

74
00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.370
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

75
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.870
It'll go well this time.

76
00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:35.410
Yes.

77
00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:52.560
Did I do something wrong?

78
00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.160
No.

79
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.800
You never do anything wrong.

80
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.769
I want you to though.

81
00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.839
Then you'd cling to me and tell me you're sorry.

82
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.209
Since you met me,

83
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.910
are you becoming unhappy?

84
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.050
If I'm unhappy,

85
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.389
it's because of me, not you.

86
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.889
If I choose unhappiness, then that's happiness.

87
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.329
I'm trying to do everything I can for you.

88
00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.769
I'm making the time I don't have...

89
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.600
to be good to you.

90
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.069
I never asked you to do that.

91
00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.509
You must be drunk.

92
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.079
I am.

93
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.209
I'm going to die from frustration.

94
00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:53.819
Why?

95
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.459
Why?

96
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.560
Why do I feel so lonely when I'm in love?

97
00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:06.060
I'm lonelier when I'm with you.

98
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.899
You leave me out of your life...

99
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.439
Mom borrowed money from Jung Woo without telling me.

100
00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.709
Would you want to share such a story?

101
00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:23.209
I'm putting my everything to keep this love.

102
00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.980
Then why do I feel like you don't love me?

103
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.120
I feel like you're just trying to fulfill your duty as a lover.

104
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.060
You must feel that way...

105
00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.829
because that's what you do.

106
00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.139
When we meet, we fight, or we try to cheer up.

107
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.579
Or we're careful around each other, so we can't talk about how we feel.

108
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.509
What kind of love is this?

109
00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:55.009
What do you want me to do?

110
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.800
Is Chef On upstairs?

111
00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:20.970
Yes.

112
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.170
Let's go up.

113
00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:25.709
You can go alone. I feel uncomfortable.

114
00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:28.850
All right.

115
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.549
Can you give me a cup of tea?

116
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.950
Of course.

117
00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.190
This way.

118
00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:49.429
Jung Sun, come here.

119
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:51.299
You should have it while it's hot.

120
00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:57.679
I assume you're depressed these days,

121
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.509
so I'm trying.

122
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.980
You loved this as a child.

123
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.179
My beef cutlet.

124
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.049
You must think you were a good mother back then.

125
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.620
Whenever you cause trouble, you always bring food from my childhood.

126
00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:16.860
I don't want to think about that time,

127
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.129
but I'm doing it for you.

128
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.000
Your father is doing well with his new wife.

129
00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.870
Maybe he and I were just a bad match.

130
00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:29.840
I hope Daniel is my last man.

131
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.340
Do you really want to talk about this with me?

132
00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:33.409
I do.

133
00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:35.980
You're more than just a child to me.

134
00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.190
By the way,

135
00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.460
about what you said before...

136
00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:50.629
How much will you give me a month?

137
00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:51.629
1,000 dollars.

138
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.269
Don't give it to me in small amounts.

139
00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.740
You have some land.

140
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.470
Can't you give me a portion?

141
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.309
I have nothing to give. It's gone.

142
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.639
Did you sell it?

143
00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:06.779
Why are you and Dad so interested in that land?

144
00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:07.909
Dad asked me about it too.

145
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.419
He has a building. Why does he care about the land?

146
00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:14.220
He's not interested in the same way you are, so don't mind him.

147
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.490
Are you protecting him since he's your dad?

148
00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:21.159
Although he and I didn't get along, he loved you.

149
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:24.600
He hit me, but he would never touch a hair on you.

150
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.129
Why aren't you eating?

151
00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:31.269
Would you eat if you were me?

152
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.940
I should meet with your dad. You'll be my excuse.

153
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:36.240
Mom.

154
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.080
You should get along with him.

155
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:39.710
He has a building.

156
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.679
You're his only son.

157
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.049
- Mom. - Yes.

158
00:10:54.929 --> 00:10:57.700
You're as beautiful as a flower.

159
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.730
Thank you.

160
00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:01.330
Didn't you go to school?

161
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.100
No, I took the year off to stay with your mom.

162
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.809
I took time off during the surgery, and I'm taking it off again.

163
00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:10.440
You two will get sick of each other.

164
00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.850
I should send you two on a trip.

165
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.710
- Really? - Yes.

166
00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:19.679
You mentioned Japan before.

172
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.000
That would be nice, but I should say thanks...

173
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.139
to the people I'm thankful to before we go.

174
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.879
Is Mr. Park here?

175
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.009
You came without an appointment.

176
00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:51.649
I'm mad. What are you doing?

177
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.559
I thought you and I were like comrades.

178
00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.990
- Was I wrong? - What got you so mad?

179
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.129
Hyun Soo's drama is scheduled to air.

180
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.470
What about me? You told me my drama was great.

181
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:11.139
Your drama will air on JK.

182
00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:13.809
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:16.309
I was about to, then you came.

184
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:18.080
Yes!

185
00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:19.840
(Hyun Soo's Mother)

186
00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:25.179
Hello?

187
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.019
Hello, Mr. Park. It's Hyun Soo's mother.

188
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.220
Yes, hello.

189
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.889
I got discharged.

190
00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:35.490
I just wanted to call and say thank you.

191
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.700
I didn't do much.

192
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.960
I'll let my husband talk to you.

193
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.299
Mr. Park.

194
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.110
Of course we should thank you.

195
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.440
The two of us would like to invite you. Let's eat.

196
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.009
Then just let me know the time and place.

197
00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:57.919
Okay. Bye now.

198
00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:02.019
Who was that?

199
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.220
Who do you want to cast?

200
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.029
Hyun Soo's parents?

201
00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:11.129
Did they invite you to dinner?

202
00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:17.169
Hyun Soo, we're going to eat with Mr. Park.

203
00:13:17.169 --> 00:13:18.269
Look into a restaurant.

204
00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:19.940
What?

205
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:24.240
He's the one that helped...

206
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:26.309
your mom get well.

207
00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:30.149
All right. I'll book for three.

208
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.350
Why 3? It should be 4.

209
00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.950
It would be awkward for us if you don't go.

210
00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:40.090
What is it? Will your boyfriend be mad?

211
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:41.789
No.

212
00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:44.799
He shouldn't be mad.

213
00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:48.429
It's a thank you meal prepared by us. Why would he be mad?

214
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.299
We'll thank Chef On too.

215
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.639
Don't worry.

216
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.740
Okay.

217
00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:07.996
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E32 Temperature of Love "Why Do I Feel Lonelier?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

218
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.129
Why do I feel so lonely when I'm in love?

219
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.669
I'm lonelier when I'm with you.

220
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:38.450
You're still here?

221
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.190
I'm still doing calculations.

222
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.559
Did you call Hyun Soo?

223
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.889
- I can't. - You have to.

224
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.090
You have to make up right away whenever you fight.

225
00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:52.460
My father is coming.

226
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.929
Mother during the day, and father at night.

227
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.600
They must have had some kind of tie.

228
00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:01.210
The pains...

229
00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:05.179
I have no problem telling you...

230
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.649
is so hard for me to tell Hyun Soo.

231
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:10.620
When you're in love,

232
00:15:11.549 --> 00:15:12.850
you want to look good in front of them.

233
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.250
You only want to give her the best.

234
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:17.519
You want to take care of the hardships on your own.

235
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.059
You know a lot.

236
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.559
I'll just add that your relationship is very healthy.

237
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.840
Hey. I'm finally here.

238
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.509
Did you really come? I told you not to.

239
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:34.740
Weren't you waiting for me?

240
00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:37.409
Is Soo Jung gone?

241
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.210
Aren't you going on a date tonight?

242
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:42.409
Have fun.

243
00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:52.419
Hey. My drama is scheduled to air on JK.

244
00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:54.590
That's great.

245
00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:56.330
Is that all?

246
00:15:57.059 --> 00:15:58.100
Yes.

247
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.870
Let me ask you this in all seriousness.

248
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:03.840
Do you really like Soo Jung?

249
00:16:06.169 --> 00:16:08.039
What is this? What does this silence mean?

250
00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:10.539
Silence usually means yes or no.

251
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.740
What could it be right now?

252
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.509
Won Joon, where did you learn such a bad habit?

253
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.379
I really loved you.

254
00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:22.090
After we broke up, I keep acting like you.

255
00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:23.990
It's contagious.

256
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.529
I have to close. Let's go.

257
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.710
You still won't give up?

258
00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.289
No.

259
00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:17.210
I'm trying to do everything I can for you.

260
00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:18.839
What kind of love is this?

261
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.250
Did I give up everything for this?

262
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.589
Gosh.

263
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.089
Don't be like that. Just call him.

264
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.059
I don't want to.

265
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.599
You were so in love with him just a while ago.

266
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.269
You must love him just as much.

267
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.470
- Does it look like I love him? - Yes.

268
00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:48.140
When you were deep in love, you were standing here like this.

269
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.400
There was traffic.

270
00:18:15.869 --> 00:18:18.099
I told you I could visit you on my day off.

271
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.210
Because every minute counts.

272
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.240
Thinking about the interest bothers me.

273
00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:31.819
Pay back your loan with this.

274
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.089
You can't grow if you have debt.

275
00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:40.289
I'll take care of it. I can handle it.

276
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.400
You must get your self-esteem from not having me around.

277
00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.329
Kids without fathers act like this.

278
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.400
- Father. - I knew your mom would ruin you.

279
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.700
Take the money while you can.

280
00:18:52.069 --> 00:18:55.670
All you have is that land. You'll end up coming to me anyway.

281
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.910
I wouldn't.

282
00:18:57.809 --> 00:18:59.980
I lived well even without you.

283
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.009
Don't try to come back into my life.

284
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.079
What did I do so wrong to you?

285
00:19:07.089 --> 00:19:08.220
I did enough.

286
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.359
Why did you never call me when I was in Paris? I was only 16.

287
00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:13.660
That's because...

288
00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.960
I had a complicated life then.

289
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.130
And one thing you would throw away was your son.

290
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.529
Just be like how you always were.

291
00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:26.200
Don't try to act like a father now.

292
00:19:27.009 --> 00:19:28.069
I still...

293
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.410
I never touched you while raising you.

294
00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:37.349
Do you know how often I got beat while growing up?

295
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.180
I got beat for no reason.

296
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.589
You didn't touch me to prove that you're different from Grandpa.

297
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:47.160
You hit Mom instead.

298
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.559
Do you know how you ruined her life?

299
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.430
You little...

300
00:21:07.339 --> 00:21:08.569
It felt as if...

301
00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:12.480
you were pushing me away because of your emotional scars and reality.

302
00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:17.119
Then why do I feel like you don't love me?

303
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.490
I feel like you're just trying to fulfill your duty as a lover.

304
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.849
Are you heading out already?

305
00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:55.849
Yes. My parents want me there early.

306
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.289
I see. They must feel awkward to be alone with Mr. Park.

307
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.789
I guess so. I should be nice since Mom's sick.

308
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.230
- I'll get going. - Okay.

309
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400
Hello.

310
00:22:46.869 --> 00:22:50.380
Hello. I haven't seen you since the surgery.

311
00:22:50.809 --> 00:22:52.079
You look well.

312
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.710
I'm glad.

313
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.779
It's thanks to you.

314
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.380
- Please sit down. - Okay.

315
00:23:02.349 --> 00:23:04.420
Since we're treating you,

316
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:07.190
- I hope you'll enjoy it. - Okay.

317
00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:17.039
Hyun Soo is the odd one in our family.

318
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.410
We all prefer a stable life, but not her.

319
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.910
That's not true.

320
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.279
Right.

321
00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:28.279
Did your parents run a business too?

322
00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:29.680
Yes.

323
00:23:30.079 --> 00:23:33.519
My father had a big business, then he went bankrupt.

324
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.450
Gosh.

325
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.259
By the way,

326
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.859
I'm curious about something.

327
00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:15.259
Yes, go ahead.

328
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.029
Are you this nice to all your contracted writers?

329
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.400
Even to their family?

330
00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:28.710
Not necessarily.

331
00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:30.880
Really?

332
00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:35.380
Are you especially nice to Hyun Soo?

333
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.950
Yes.

334
00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:40.849
I...

335
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.420
like Hyun Soo.

336
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.890
(Temperature of Love)

337
00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:17.160
It'll air faster than what we originally thought.

338
00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:18.960
Do you think you can do it?

339
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.089
Why is her drama airing first?

340
00:25:21.089 --> 00:25:22.589
You better be ready if mine gets delayed.

341
00:25:22.589 --> 00:25:25.329
We'll be opening a new restaurant in Hong Kong.

342
00:25:25.329 --> 00:25:27.630
I recommended you as the head chef.

343
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.430
I'm so glad things are working out for you.

344
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.200
- Let's live together. - I'm not sure anymore.

345
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.240
Mr. Park, this is your chance.

346
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.240
Is it really over between you and Hyun Soo?

347
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.710
- Did you call? - Can we meet?

348
00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:42.549
- I'm sorry. - I'll wait until you come.
