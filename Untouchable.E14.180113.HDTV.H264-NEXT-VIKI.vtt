<i>Timing & subtitles brought to you by the Touch Me If You Can Team @ Viki</i>

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.760 line:93%
Why are you doing this?

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.340 line:93%
I will take responsibility for your family for the rest of your lives.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.580 line:93%
That's the only way I am able to compensate you.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.710 line:93%
But I don't even know who you are.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:58.450 line:93%
I am the son of the person who murdered both Lee Sung Gyoon and Lee Sung Gyoon's father.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.430 line:93%
Please do not forgive my father.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.190 line:93%
I will not forgive my father either.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.920 line:93%
<i>Untouchable
- 14 -</i>

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.390 line:93%
Joo Tae Seop killed Lee Sung Gyoon.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.580 line:93%
Don't you think he is making things worse?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.780 line:93%
Lee Sung Gyoon needed to be taken care of anyway.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.590 line:93%
Joo Tae Seop is simply doing what he should do.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.850 line:93%
There is something that can be stopped with my power as Police Chief.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.460 line:93%
Jang Joon Seo currently has a prosecutor on his side.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.580 line:93%
If he's not careful, he's going to flare up my temper.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.500 line:93%
It seems like you've gotten soft.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000 line:93%
Are you doubting our power because I'm being temporarily detained?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.630 line:93%
No, that is definitely not the case.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.060 line:93%
You are not the Police Chief.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.340 line:93%
You're just a worker in the world that he has created.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.970 line:93%
Don't get it confused with the world you live in.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.280 line:93%
Okay. I understand.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.310 line:93%
I didn't think it through.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.620 line:93%
Police?! A beast doesn't realize he's an animal and tries to act like a human?!

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.440 line:93%
What should I do about a bastard like that?!

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.250 line:93%
How did you find out that former mayor Jang Beom Ho killed Detective Lee's father?

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.170 line:93%
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.630 line:93%
Did you tell Detective Lee?

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.790 line:93%
No. I couldn't tell him.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.380 line:93%
Why?

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.030 line:93%
I was afraid he would suffer the same fate as Jung Hye.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.760 line:93%
But in the end, that's what happened.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.740 line:93%
Another colleague of mine has died unjustly.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.820 line:93%
We can't just sit back and watch anymore.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.930 line:93%
We are going to find Jang Beom Ho.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.760 line:93%
If he uses a trick to escape again...

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.680 line:93%
I'm going to kill your father.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.560 line:93%
He's already dead to the world.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.040 line:93%
There's no one to penalize me for killing him.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.460 line:93%
You also need to make a choice.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.270 line:93%
If you feel like you can't be with us, take your hands off of this now.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.150 line:93%
You can't kill your father with your own hands.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.180 line:93%
I will deal with my father.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.850 line:93%
A son will not be able to kill his own father.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.960 line:93%
But a father will not be able to kill his own son.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.800 line:93%
Harimoto Ichiro... Jang Beom Ho

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.800 line:93%
You guys are wrong.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.120 line:93%
I am not Jang Beom Ho.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.910 line:93%
Father...

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.860 line:93%
Why did you appear again? Why?

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.770 line:93%
For what purpose? What Reason? Why?

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.820 line:93%
Lee Sung Gyoon is dead.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.990 line:93%
Who is Lee Sung Gyoon?

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.970 line:93%
He's the son of the man father beat to death with the burning log.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.470 line:93%
So what?

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:41.320 line:93%
He's the son of Byung Suk ahjussi. He killed the father and now he killed the son.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.740 line:93%
Our father did this.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.480 line:93%
Jang Joon Seo...

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.230 line:93%
You really need to free yourself from father's ghost.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:58.320 line:93%
Our father is dead and that guy is dead because of you.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.360 line:93%
If you hadn't run after that nonsensical illusion, he would not have died.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.370 line:93%
It's all your fault.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.040 line:93%
Fine. He died because of me.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.660 line:93%
If I had reported father back then, the son wouldn't have died.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.220 line:93%
Bukcheon was a world our father controlled.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.440 line:93%
If it wasn't for our father, Bukcheon would have been torn apart bit by bit...

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.510 line:93%
and would have been made non-existent from this world.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.700 line:93%
He created that world.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.060 line:93%
In order to create that world, some insignificant people needed to be sacrificed.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.160 line:93%
Have you no thought that father could be alive, in that messed up thinking of yours?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:51.060 line:93%
He never intended to hand Bukcheon over to you.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.420 line:93%
Father never gave up on Bukcheon, even after his death.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.670 line:93%
Don't be father's puppet anymore... please.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.790 line:93%
Is that how I look to you?

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.760 line:93%
Hyung, I'm afraid of father.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.710 line:93%
You're afraid of father too?

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:24.380 line:93%
If we pretend not to know, nothing else will happen.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.060 line:93%
No more people will have to die.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.400 line:93%
Then just let it go. Let him do whatever he wants.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.950 line:93%
Then we have to live like this for the rest of our lives.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:47.040 line:93%
Just like we did in the past. That's what I'm afraid of.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:11.100 line:93%
News of Lee Seong Gyun's murder isn't in the newspaper, on broadcast or on the internet.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.150 line:93%
Lee Seong Gyun has disappeared without a trace.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.230 line:93%
If he didn't save us,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.410 line:93%
we would have disappeared in the same way.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.580 line:93%
Just like the officers. It would have been dismissed as an accident.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.320 line:93%
Prosecutor... if you could work through the prosecutors office...

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.290 line:93%
No, that's not it.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.840 line:93%
Prosecutor Seo is in more danger than anyone else.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.280 line:93%
Because she's the only person to have seen Jang Beom Ho alive.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.190 line:93%
As Team Leader Go said, I'm someone who can't get out of this case anymore,

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.060 line:93%
but you guys are different. Even now...

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.180 line:93%
What? You're telling me to get out of this?

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.980 line:93%
You are currently under suspension.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.190 line:93%
There's no reason for you to keep hanging onto this case.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:12.090 line:93%
Prosecutor, I hated Lee Seong Gyun.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.220 line:93%
Do you know why?

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.850 line:93%
Because he was a real police.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.530 line:93%
Someone I could never keep up with...

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.160 line:93%
Because he was a real police.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.560 line:93%
Because I was embarrassed... I hated him out of envy.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.460 line:93%
Someone like him can't just die like a dog.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:46.000 line:93%
He should have stayed alive until the end,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.250 line:93%
to show everyone that the police of our country are this cool,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.450 line:93%
this is what a real police is like.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.850 line:93%
It's so unfair that I feel like I'm going to die.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.760 line:93%
The only thing I can do right now,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.750 line:93%
is go after his wishes.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.230 line:93%
If you're going to get out of this, go ahead.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.320 line:93%
Even if I die, I'm going to complete his wish.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.920 line:93%
We can't get out anyway.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:35.910 line:93%
While Jang Beom Ho is alive, we will also die like Lee Seong Gyun some day.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.580 line:93%
We have to find Jang Beom Ho.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:46.860 line:93%
We have to find him, and make it so he can never come back alive.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.070 line:93%
That's how we can live.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.950 line:93%
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.010 line:93%
No, I'm comfortable.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:06.230 line:93%
Just deal with this a little longer. You'll be out soon.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.620 line:93%
Where is father?

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.340 line:93%
Shouldn't you at least know where he is?

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.970 line:93%
He must have gone somewhere good, since he did many good things before he passed away.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.460 line:93%
Isn't it embarrassing?

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.630 line:93%
Why do I have to hear about the fact that my father's alive from someone else?

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.550 line:93%
Did he not trust me at all?

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.120 line:93%
You've heard false rumours.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.910 line:93%
Yong Ahjussi, I'll ask you again.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.250 line:93%
Where is father?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.850 line:93%
He passed away.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:07.470 line:93%
Tell father, I... miss him.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.830 line:93%
Tell him that I miss the father that tricked his own son.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:21.350 line:93%
Tell him that if he deceives me one more time, his puppet will get extremely angry.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:31.280 line:93%
Officer Goo, could you get Noh Ji Wan's call records? I bet there's a record of him communicating with Joo Tae Seop.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.410 line:93%
You are telling me to get the call records for the current Police Chief?

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.390 line:93%
Do you think that it's possible?

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.220 line:93%
It's possible if it's you.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:46.060 line:93%
That's true, I want to complete Lee Seong Gyun's wish, what is there that I can't do?

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.910 line:93%
Why don't I just bring down a satellite from out of the sky...

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.470 line:93%
and pull it right now. Don't worry.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.090 line:93%
Team Leader Go and Jae Woo, please find this person.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.620 line:93%
This is the doctor who pronounced my father was dead.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.000 line:93%
He's the only person who can reveal the secret of my father's death.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.940 line:93%
He's probably in a hideout in Seoul somewhere.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:13.180 line:93%
Team Leader Jang, if we go about this the wrong way, we could make it dangerous for him.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.170 line:93%
This person will always be on the run as long as my father is alive.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.020 line:93%
Director Lee Sun Mi stated in a press briefing this afternoon...

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:28.270 line:93%
that there are plans to build the largest international financial center in Asia within Bukcheon.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:33.520 line:93%
The Bukcheon international financial center will house the financial institutions of the world...

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.880 line:93%
and will be developed as the new hub of Asian finance.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:44.550 line:93%
Ah yes. I'm very grateful to you for airing the broadcast earlier than planned.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.120 line:93%
The broadcast was quite adequate.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.580 line:93%
No.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.160 line:93%
Of course it's something I should be grateful for.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.860 line:93%
Bukcheon is my hometown.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.000 line:93%
Now I see why the Goo family was so interested in that piece of land.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.740 line:93%
If the international finance center is built, the surrounding area will become the new center of Bukcheon.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.600 line:93%
The value of the land will go up ten-fold.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.260 line:93%
How much is that worth?

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.940 line:93%
Aigoo, I'm going crazy.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:31.730 line:93%
I should have inherited that land. I'm the crazy one.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.160 line:93%
I never paid attention to it because I thought it could get taken from me at any moment.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.500 line:93%
What do you mean taken from you at any moment? Didn't that all belong to grandfather?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.310 line:93%
That land originally belonged to the Japanese during the occupation.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:48.750 line:93%
But as soon as we became independent, my father secretly had the ownership of the land transferred to his name.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.220 line:93%
The truth is, that land should have been transferred to the national government.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.500 line:93%
That's why I never paid attention to it.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.250 line:93%
So you are saying that golden plot of land can be turned into a plot of poop?

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.250 line:93%
What do you mean by that?

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.130 line:93%
- Yes?
- What happened to the matter I requested?

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.860 line:93%
Yes, I found it. I'll come in person and tell you the details.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:25.720 line:93%
Father, the real estate records were managed by Bukcheon city officials during the Japanese occupation, correct?

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.890 line:93%
Of course. Why do you ask?

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.970 line:93%
That's the reason Goo Ja Gyeong wants to make Gi Seo the mayor.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:43.790 line:93%
Chairman Harimoto has said he will postpone the withdrawal of investments on the land he used for collateral.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.640 line:93%
But instead, he is thinking of having it turned over as public property.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.510 line:93%
No. We have absolutely no such intentions.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.850 line:93%
The situation has changed.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.290 line:93%
If we were to get a loan from the bank using that land as collateral...

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.760 line:93%
it's worth so much that we could easily get 500 million dollars.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.920 line:93%
Didn't you tell me yourself that there's corruption involved?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.900 line:93%
You have no idea when and how the situation my change again.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.530 line:93%
That land has already become a center for international business.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.110 line:93%
Do you really think they'll expose that corruption?

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.620 line:93%
I understand. I'll let the chairman know for now.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.250 line:93%
Are the business talks going well?

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.600 line:93%
What did you find?

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.640 line:93%
Oh that...

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.530 line:93%
It's the report on Jung Yoon Mi's husband's death.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.900 line:93%
The story of his death is quite shocking. I think it will be very helpful for the campaign.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.800 line:93%
<i>Death Report</i>

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.170 line:93%
<i>[ Cause of death: Sickness: Miscellaneous (Death due to serious malnutrition)
Location: In another city

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.590 line:93%
Thanks for your hard work.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.970 line:93%
It's nothing. Of course I should help if it's to help Gi Seo become mayor.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.040 line:93%
You are satellite number one.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.830 line:93%
You are satellite number two.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.790 line:93%
I'm the space station. You understand the organizational structure, right?

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.760 line:93%
Yes,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.250 line:93%
The hands that were dirtied from pickpocketing all this time...

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.940 line:93%
You're being placed into a universal mission that is for the good of all mankind.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.530 line:93%
Isn't this an honor?

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.230 line:93%
- Ah, yes.
- Yes.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.290 line:93%
Satellite one, the target is approaching.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.950 line:93%
Right now.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.360 line:93%
Sorry.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.100 line:93%
Here you go.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:14.390 line:93%
<i>[ 010-4039-81

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.700 line:93%
Go.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.230 line:93%
Shhh. Be still.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.320 line:93%
Sorry. I'm really in a hurry.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.490 line:93%
<i>Candidate Jung Yoon Mi's husband died homeless.
Jung Yoon Mi reported her own husband.</i>

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.000 line:93%
Something too bad was exposed. It won't be easy to recover from it.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:09.860 line:93%
Seeing the flow of the news at the moment, I think retrieving the cost of the campaign will be difficult.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:15.740 line:93%
I think it's a clear choice to give up right now.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.980 line:93%
Hello, Prosecutor.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.870 line:93%
You're saying that you'll give up on my Mom, right?

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.880 line:93%
Honestly, she's a good person for politics. I think she'll succeed.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.110 line:93%
However, in this election...

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:41.220 line:93%
You're saying a woman who reported her own husband and left him to die homeless would make a good politician...

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.160 line:93%
You think she'll succeed?

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.950 line:93%
You know the inner workings of this world.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.030 line:93%
Power doesn't go to nice people.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:57.060 line:93%
Right, but the problem is that the bad person is my mom.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:09.960 line:93%
Let me ask you one thing. Did you know or not?

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.900 line:93%
I didn't know.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.050 line:93%
You're lying, right?

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.270 line:93%
I Ra...

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.060 line:93%
You should have just said you did it for me.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:37.000 line:93%
That you did it because it would have stopped me from succeeding as a prosecutor.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.610 line:93%
It's what that person wanted.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.790 line:93%
He said he wanted to stay as a good dad to you.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.090 line:93%
Do you know where he was buried?

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.950 line:93%
Mom, Dad is our family.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:05.510 line:93%
He has no right to be your father or my husband.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.820 line:93%
Dad loved me, Mom.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.860 line:93%
I was also in anguish and in pain.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.950 line:93%
I just didn't want you to be hurt as well.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.030 line:93%
Fine, I'll believe it as so.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:27.080 line:93%
I"ll try my best to. If not, I don't think I'll be able to forgive you.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.000 line:93%
Yes, I'm Jung Yoon Mi.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.020 line:93%
Hello, I'm Director Jang Gyu Ho from Bukcheon Construction.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.890 line:93%
Director Jang Gyu Ho?

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:09.800 line:93%
Yes, Prosecutor Seo I Ra is alone. Yes, right now.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.930 line:93%
She's getting in a taxi.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.830 line:93%
Yes, I understand.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.360 line:93%
Follow the taxi?

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.810 line:93%
Forget it, our work ends here. Let's head to the station.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.180 line:93%
Who were you on the phone with?

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:34.520 line:93%
The police. A much more powerful one.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.010 line:93%
You must've been very upset from the recent article.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.760 line:93%
Wasn't it your side who released it?

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.810 line:93%
What is my side?

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.090 line:93%
You're also a part of the Jang family.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.120 line:93%
Just because I'm part of the Jang family, doesn't mean we're on the same side.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.810 line:93%
Please get to the point.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:01.040 line:93%
It'll be hard to win this election, because Jang Gi Seo has the amazing Goo Ja Gyeong helping him.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.120 line:93%
So you're telling me to give up?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.470 line:93%
No. I'm giving you strength to not give up.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:13.980 line:93%
The way to beat Gi Seo is actually quite simple. Make Goo Ja Gyeong be on your side.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:19.890 line:93%
Because Goo Ja Gyeong has all of Jang family's power right now.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.680 line:93%
Say something that's feasible. The two of them are a married couple.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.950 line:93%
Weren't you and your husband also a married couple?

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.880 line:93%
Use this to bring Goo Ja Gyeong onto your side.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.990 line:93%
I think you have a lot of greed, why don't you do it yourself? Why are you giving me this...

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:56.360 line:93%
I have no ambition to go all the way up at once. I will go slowly, and start from Deputy Mayor.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.920 line:93%
Of course, it'll only be possible if you become Mayor.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.260 line:93%
What is the content?

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:10.480 line:93%
It's a matter of justice and there are two ways to use this document.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.000 line:93%
Do we spread the wings of justice or fold them?

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.980 line:93%
I'm in front of my house, I'm almost home.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.120 line:93%
I told you to call me when you got off work. It's dangerous for you to go around alone.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.950 line:93%
<i>Don't worry, I can protect my own body.</i>

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.660 line:93%
Call me when you get home. <i>Be careful until you get into your house.</i>

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.840 line:93%
Okay.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.850 line:93%
If someone next to me heard this they'd think I'm in a relationship.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:52.490 line:93%
My car is at the company, I think I'll have to take yours.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.200 line:93%
Where's the key?

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.030 line:93%
Yes, I found it.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.120 line:93%
- Pregnancy Notebook
- Goo Ja Gyeong

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.920 line:93%
<i>Then we'll have to live like this for the rest of our lives too.</i>

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.030 line:93%
<i>Just like how we did in the past.</i>

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.960 line:93%
<i>I'm scared of that.</i>

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.930 line:93%
Don't come. Don't come.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.980 line:93%
Don't come!

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.050 line:93%
I Ra!

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.950 line:93%
You're back?

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.770 line:93%
Sit.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.840 line:93%
It's been a while, let's drink together.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.240 line:93%
Ja Gyeong.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.090 line:93%
If that child was born to us,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.780 line:93%
would there have been a change in our relationship?

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:35.970 line:93%
I wish you wouldn't take about the past. It's annoying.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.930 line:93%
Nothing about you has changed.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.450 line:93%
You're exactly the same as when I first met you.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:55.360 line:93%
You only saw Joon Seo then. Although it was hard, I acknowledged it right away.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.940 line:93%
And I gave up.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.140 line:93%
What are you trying to say?

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.860 line:93%
I saw the ultrasound picture in your bag.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:10.930 line:93%
Isn't it weird?

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.990 line:93%
I saw hope instead of despair.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.360 line:93%
I thought I would be able to have what I gave up on a long time ago.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.930 line:93%
I also understood why you wanted to leave me. You also...

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.030 line:93%
wanted to have hope.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.950 line:93%
Ja Gyeong...

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.720 line:93%
shall we leave together?

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.880 line:93%
I don't have lingering feelings toward what's not mine to begin with.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.980 line:93%
I want to rest with you.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.200 line:93%
Where did you get that gun from?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.080 line:93%
I applied to the police arms division for an official permit.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.500 line:93%
Why? Why do you need to carry a gun around with you?

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.230 line:93%
- There's a reason for it.
- Tell me why!

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:23.680 line:93%
A prosecutor is a dangerous profession. I carry it around because I need it.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.420 line:93%
You're carrying it around because you think your life is in danger.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.060 line:93%
You... you even shot a gun.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:37.010 line:93%
I Ra, what exactly is happening to you?

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:49.170 line:93%
Yes, I got home safely. Nothing happened, so don't worry.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.140 line:93%
Who is it?

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.890 line:93%
It's Jang Joon Seo, right? He put you in this situation right?

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.510 line:93%
You... don't get involved with him anymore.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.430 line:93%
Don't get involved with anything that has to do with him.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:07.240 line:93%
Forget it. Don't make this into such a big deal.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.500 line:93%
It was nothing. It's not something for you to care about.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.890 line:93%
You... quit your job as a prosecutor.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:19.630 line:93%
No matter what I do I'll get you an office, so leave this place and become a lawyer.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.510 line:93%
It's my life. I'll do what I want.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.020 line:93%
Hey, Seo I Ra!

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:29.520 line:93%
I... how can I live when I'm so uneasy. You're my entire life.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.190 line:93%
Don't pull me into your life like that.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:37.060 line:93%
Don't talk as if you lived for me.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:42.790 line:93%
Mom, you just lived for your own life.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:50.580 line:93%
Throwing Dad away, also wasn't for me, it was for yourself.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.700 line:93%
I'm just an excuse for your ambitions.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.570 line:93%
No matter what you say I'm your Mom.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:07.620 line:93%
I'm going to protect you, no matter what I have to do.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.820 line:93%
<i>I have no regret towards the things that aren't mine.</i>

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.850 line:93%
<i>I want to rest, with you.</i>

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.660 line:93%
<i>Do you have the confidence to not come back?</i>

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:50.870 line:93%
<i>I want to find my real life. Give me a chance, Ja Gyeong.</i>

00:33:54.894 --> 00:33:59.894 line:93%

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.460 line:93%
Yes?

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.440 line:93%
I'm Jung Yoon Mi.

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:11.270 line:93%
Why are you contacting me?

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.580 line:93%
I have something to say.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.740 line:93%
When can I meet you?

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.830 line:93%
My time is a bit...

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.670 line:93%
I could change my mind...

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:24.960 line:93%
shouldn't we meet before that happens?

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.750 line:93%
I'll find some time.

<i>Citizens are happy, making Bukcheon liveable</i>

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.350 line:93%
Call me when you get off work. Don't go off on your own again.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.510 line:93%
Hey.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.480 line:93%
If what happened to Jung Hye unnie happens to me...

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.330 line:93%
will you miss me as much as you miss Jung Hye unnie?

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:13.450 line:93%
Why? Why are you suddenly saying stuff like that?

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.740 line:93%
No, I just wanted to say it. Don't worry about it.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.180 line:93%
I really want to die.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.440 line:93%
Yes, hello. Customer, while using our card...

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.700 line:93%
Rude b*stard.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.610 line:93%
Did anything come up?

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.860 line:93%
I've checked most of the numbers.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.600 line:93%
None of them seem to be Joo Tae Seop's voice.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.020 line:93%
This guy is suspicious. He spoke with this guy the most before the Lee Sung Gyoon incident.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.260 line:93%
Is he not picking up the phone?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.460 line:93%
There's signal, but I think he isn't picking up calls from unknown numbers.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.330 line:93%
Have it show up as being from Noh Ji Wan. I'll bet he'll pick it up then.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.650 line:93%
That's illegal.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.020 line:93%
I"m just saying.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.200 line:93%
Am I a police officer or a criminal?

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.660 line:93%
What is my identity?

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:33.320 line:93%
Elections really hurt people.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.780 line:93%
But they can also be freeing.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:47.250 line:93%
Like washing away dirt that's been sitting on your skin for a long time.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.930 line:93%
You're adjusting to this world quickly.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.920 line:93%
When I looked into the registry...

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.640 line:93%
I saw that the site for the expo was previously under your name.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.730 line:93%
Wasn't that land originally designated as a greenbelt property?

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.750 line:93%
I'm disappointed.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:13.810 line:93%
Anyone can find that kind of weakness just by searching on the internet.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.720 line:93%
I guess I misjudged you.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.090 line:93%
Adjusting to this world...

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.550 line:93%
will take you a little more time.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:30.990 line:93%
Not long ago, there was an article I found in the paper...

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.380 line:93%
- News Story
- Prosecution Service

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:43.090 line:93%
The work of the Prosecutors' Office that's regaining the land that once belonged to the Japanese government under the Japanese rule is moving right along.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:46.740 line:93%
During the civil lawsuit against the civilian who insists on the ownership of the land...

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:54.060 line:93%
The Korean government was able to claim the land in question as its property.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.860 line:93%
Former President Goo Yong Chan, what do you think will be the effect of the international finance center...

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:08.880 line:93%
on Bukcheon.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.770 line:93%
Bukcheon will likely take on a new appearance.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:17.300 line:93%
It will be a totally different city with a new way of doing things.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.130 line:93%
There was a lot of competition...

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:24.410 line:93%
But rumors are that because of your political influence...

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:29.100 line:93%
that Bukcheon was selected. Are these rumors correct?

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.760 line:93%
Bukcheon is a city with a long history and great potential.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.980 line:93%
To make Bukcheon the best city in Korea...

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.660 line:93%
I will exert all my strength.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:47.360 line:93%
But one thing that bothers me a bit...

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:53.960 line:93%
Is that Japanese chairman Mokiup has been trying to get his hands on the development of this project.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.790 line:93%
This is the first time I have heard of this.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.530 line:93%
It hasn't come to the surface yet.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.710 line:93%
But I think he will give up soon.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:11.210 line:93%
The citizens of Bukcheon will not allow Bukcheon...

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:15.760 line:93%
to fall into Japanese hands.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.620 line:93%
Hmmmph!

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.240 line:93%
Are you doing better?

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.670 line:93%
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.750 line:93%
Let me see.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.280 line:93%
It's a good thing it wasn't worse.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.200 line:93%
Make sure you get this wound treated properly and...

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.470 line:93%
- Take it easy for the time being and rest.
- Yes, Sir.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.840 line:93%
It's Police Chief Noh Ji Wan. Can I take the call?

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.350 line:93%
Sure.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.390 line:93%
Yes, Boss.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:17.220 line:93%
Joo Tae Seop... where are you right now?

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:21.980 line:93%
Are you with father?

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:27.420 line:93%
Put me on the phone with him. I want to talk with father.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.260 line:93%
What? Didn't you say it was Chief Noh?

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.150 line:93%
It's your son.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:43.930 line:93%
I think he knows I'm with you.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.350 line:93%
Joon Seo?

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.060 line:93%
Give it.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.660 line:93%
Sir.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:10.190 line:93%
Put father on the phone.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:19.760 line:93%
Is father listening right now?

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:30.510 line:93%
Father... let me ask you a favor.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:34.100 line:93%
For the sake of my brother and I, just once...

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.290 line:93%
Please just once, bow down your head in front of the world.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:45.430 line:93%
This is the last favor I'll ask of you as your son.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:56.200 line:93%
For the sake of Gi Seo, who sacrificed his entire life for you.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.310 line:93%
Please... father.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:17.420 line:93%
Tell Hak Soo I will need to go out soon.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.230 line:93%
Yes, I'll make the call.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.550 line:93%
You were on the phone with your Father?

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.980 line:93%
I heard it... the sound of my father breathing.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.850 line:93%
We found that doctor.

00:42:53.874 --> 00:42:56.874 line:93%
[Land Ledger]

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:09.700 line:93%
I have always worked for my country.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:14.620 line:93%
So if I had to betray my country...

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.380 line:93%
there would have to be a very big reason, enough to change my life.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:26.800 line:93%
You really want to be the mayor of Bukcheon?

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.310 line:93%
That would only be possible if my husband dropped out of the race.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:39.400 line:93%
I have abandoned my lifelong belief in the value of justice.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.260 line:93%
He was in a hideout by himself in Seoul.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.400 line:93%
What should we do? Catch him?

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.380 line:93%
Not by force. We need to make him feel that he needs us.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.910 line:93%
- You said you know his number?
- Yeah.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.380 line:93%
I got the number from the hotel he checked into.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.490 line:93%
Send these pictures to that number.

<i>Timing & subtitles brought to you by the Touch Me If You Can Team @ Viki</i>

That'll be 8,000 won.

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.480 line:93%
Sir!

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.560 line:93%
Do you think he knows he's being watched?

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.540 line:93%
No way.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.430 line:93%
- What the? He's gone.
- What?

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.580 line:93%
We just barely found him.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:05.200 line:93%
What? Do you have something to say to me?

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:17.060 line:93%
Dad. Have you ever regretted sending me to that house?

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:27.110 line:93%
Ja Gyeong... I have never thought of you as a means to an end.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:35.300 line:93%
You're my daughter. You're the only person who will cry for me when I die.

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:42.150 line:93%
Do you really think I will cry for you then?

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.020 line:93%
Why are you being like this?

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:50.180 line:93%
The only person I trust is you.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:57.750 line:93%
But you know what? I can't trust anybody.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:05.560 line:93%
I want to trust people, but it's not easy.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:13.920 line:93%
Are you saying you can't even trust your own father?

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.670 line:93%
You're the one you raised me like this.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:30.080 line:93%
Ja Gyeong, I just wanted you to be fit to be my daughter...

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.380 line:93%
to make you into the best.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:47.320 line:93%
I thought Jang Gi Seo was an idiot.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.020 line:93%
I wondered why he couldn't free himself from his father.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:47:00.210 line:93%
But I realized I was more idiotic than he was.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.930 line:93%
Prosecutor.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.950 line:93%
Hello.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:15.150 line:93%
You're the prosecutor that took me to the hospital not too long ago, right?

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.000 line:93%
Yes...

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:21.620 line:93%
I would like your company to handle the Yoo Na Na case.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.540 line:93%
Okay, we'll do that.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.780 line:93%
I used my influence at the courthouse. She should be released soon if you file the lawsuit.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.420 line:93%
Alright.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:34.870 line:93%
And I won't be involved in Yong ahjussi's trial anymore. You take care of it.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.250 line:93%
If you think it will be too difficult to get an innocent verdict, do your best to shorten the sentence as much as possible.

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.780 line:93%
Okay.

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.540 line:93%
You can go.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:07.130 line:93%
I'm going to stop being your son.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.010 line:93%
I'll tell you everything.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:29.060 line:93%
What happened the day Jang Beom Ho died.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:37.160 line:93%

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.310 line:93%
<i>Will you really be alright?</i>

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.770 line:93%
<i>Trust me. I'll stay alive.</i>

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.270 line:93%
<i>This medication will block your arteries little by little.</i>

<i>Then in about 10 minutes, your heartbeat will stop.</i>

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.190 line:93%
<i>Shock! Shock! Shock!</i>

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.010 line:93%
<i>Shock!</i>

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:07.030 line:93%
<i>It's not working. This was always a possibility. I'm sorry.</i>

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.010 line:93%
<i>This is all I can do.</i>

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:13.590 line:93%
<i>The mayor said he will survive. That means he will.</i>

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.650 line:93%
<i>I can't. His heart will burst!</i>

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:19.480 line:93%
<i>Do it!</i>

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:27.800 line:93%
<i>Move!</i>

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.610 line:93%
<i>Shock!</i>

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.050 line:93%
He did survive but there were some complications.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:06.370 line:93%
He came to me in secret to Dongpa Hospital for that treatment.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:11.350 line:93%
That's why I thought I would be safe.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:18.990 line:93%
I thought through it carefully, how I could remain alive. I came to one conclusion.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.650 line:93%
If I'm the only one who knows, I will die.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:28.610 line:93%
The only way I can survive is to let the world know that Jang Beom Ho is still alive.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.100 line:93%
I understand. We will protect you.

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.670 line:93%
Going somewhere?

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.950 line:93%
I have a quick appointment.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.910 line:93%
You look pretty.

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.200 line:93%
I'm going.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:59.200 line:93%
Did you think about what I said?

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.820 line:93%
I have never thought about it.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:10.740 line:93%
I already decided. You need to make your decision.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.140 line:93%
Come back quickly. I'll be waiting.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.670 line:93%
<i>I don't have lingering feelings toward what's not mine to begin with.</i>

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.500 line:93%
<i>I want to rest with you.</i>

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.750 line:93%
<i>It's only possible if my husband loses the election.</i>

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:52.980 line:93%
<i>I threw away the value of justice which I believed in all my life.</i>

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.510 line:93%
<i>You're the only one I trust.</i>

00:52:55.510 --> 00:53:02.220 line:93%
<i>But I realized that I'm more idiotic than him.</i>

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:08.470 line:93%
<i>I want to find my true life. Give me a chance, Ja Gyeong.</i>

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:38.590 line:93%
What is this about, Yong ahjussi?

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.750 line:93%
<i>Can you come to the detention center for a second?</i>

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:44.390 line:93%
<i>There's something I want to say face-to-face.</i>

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:48.050 line:93%
All right. I'll visit you soon.

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:07.410 line:93%
As you mentioned, I delivered the money to Detective Lee Seong Gyoon's family.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:14.330 line:93%
And I also delivered money to the families of detectives who died during the Heugryeongdo incident.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:16.600 line:93%
Good work.

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:26.050 line:93%
Team Leader Jang. There's a limit to what you can resolve with money.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:28.220 line:93%
I know that already.

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:33.620 line:93%
I heard that your father is with Joo Tae Seop.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:41.620 line:93%
If we can confirm the location where Joo Tae Seop called from, I'm sure we can find your father.

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:50.260 line:93%
What will you do if you get to meet your father?

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:56.670 line:93%
I made a request to my father. I'd like to give him some time for the last time.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:00.840 line:93%
You must be busy with election activities these days. Thank you for your time.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.210 line:93%
The reason candidate Jang Gi Seo is continuously showing high approval rating...

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:08.260 line:93%
can be because he's the son of deceased Former Mayor Jang Beom Ho.

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:12.380 line:93%
But I believe your role as his wife, someone who is a daughter of former President, is also great.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.320 line:93%
There's not much time left until the election.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.650 line:93%
Please tell us your statement of resolution as we approach the election.

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:26.100 line:93%
I will probably have nothing to do with this election.

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:33.550 line:93%
I will be divorcing candidate Jang Gi Seo very soon.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:41.020 line:93%
<i>I only played a role of a fake wife all this time.</i>

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:48.360 line:93%
<i>When the news of his affair broke out, the relationship between him and I were over.</i>

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:54.290 line:93%
<i>He only tried to use me for the election.</i>

00:55:55.350 --> 00:56:03.560 line:93%
<i>I will not be playing the role of Jang family puppet any longer.</i>

Did you hear about Gi Seo and Ja Gyeong's divorce?

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.550 line:93%
It's not anything to be surprised about. They didn't have a good relationship to begin with.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:34.490 line:93%
But still, this is so sudden! What is Ja Gyeong thinking?

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.970 line:93%
On top of that, right before the election?

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:41.270 line:93%
Father. We'll become the runner up in Bukcheon.

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:46.850 line:93%
There's only one thing left now. Goo Ja Gyeong.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.760 line:93%
I think we should spend the funds without holding back.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:01.820 line:93%
Yes. I believe there will be a Japyeong Party mayor for the first time in the history of Bukcheon.

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.080 line:93%
Yes, of course.

The fact that you have something to say to me means Father has something to say to me, right?

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:01.930 line:93%
What is it that Father wants to tell me?

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:06.570 line:93%
I'll admit that I ordered him to kill Yoon Jung Hye.

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:12.400 line:93%
You didn't order him, Yong ahjussi. You only delivered his message.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:20.280 line:93%
Your father regretted killing Yoon Jung Hye.

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:28.290 line:93%
He agonized over the fact that he had to kill the woman his son loved.

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:35.190 line:93%
For price of doing so, he may have accepted the fate of dying when he could've avoided it.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.460 line:93%
That's what I think.

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:46.160 line:93%
Why are you telling me that now? Are you telling me to forgive Father?

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.720 line:93%
You must understand your father.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:52.250 line:93%
Then, tell him to come out and say it himself.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:57.580 line:93%
"I killed my son's wife. So, I'll be punished for it."

00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:01.590 line:93%
Why can't he say it himself? Why not?

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:07.850 line:93%
Father loves you more than anyone.

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:13.150 line:93%
So, tell him to come out to the world for the sake of the son he loves so much.

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:24.950 line:93%
I got it. I'll tell your father.

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.220 line:93%
I won't wait around too long.

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.550 line:93%
Please don't let me find Father myself.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.580 line:93%
Why did you want to see me?

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:28.710 line:93%
- Gi Seo.
- Father!
