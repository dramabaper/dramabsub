00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:11.304
Last week on The Law of Jungle in Cook Islands.

2
00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.304
It's already been three days since the start of survival.

3
00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:17.945
They split into team to find flags and food.

4
00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.714
In the southern sea that the members first visited,

5
00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:24.644
they found a handful of clams and gastropods and got excited.

6
00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:28.714
The other team managed to find two pieces of the map...

7
00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:32.654
on a seashore cliff and a limestone cave.

8
00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:33.724
This is it.

9
00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:34.754
What is that sound?

10
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.665
<v ->On their way back home, - It's here.</v>

11
00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:39.525
a coconut crab showed itself.

12
00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:42.794
It must not know that Se Ri waited so long...

13
00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:45.205
to try the coconut crabs.

14
00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:46.574
Is there a stronger branch?

15
00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:49.175
It was hidden in between rocks and wouldn't budge.

16
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:50.205
<v ->It's trying to attack. - Did you get it?</v>

17
00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:52.345
However, the three of them...

18
00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:54.415
cornered the coconut crab with their attention focused on it.

19
00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:57.144
Who will come out to be the winner of this battle?

20
00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:00.754
It's here.

21
00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:02.254
<v ->It's a stronger one. - Se Ri.</v>

22
00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:03.724
<v ->Sit down and try. - Try it, Se Ri.</v>

23
00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:05.054
Be careful.

24
00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.955
<v ->Put it in its hand. - It's the pincer.</v>

25
00:01:08.955 --> 00:01:10.465
<v ->The pincer. - Yes.</v>

26
00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:12.465
(The golf queen takes a step...)

27
00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:15.164
(towards the coconut crab.)

28
00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:20.705
I wanted to try the coconut crab the most as a viewer.

29
00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.744
Everybody seemed to enjoy it. It has an interesting flavor,

30
00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:25.944
<v ->so I was very curious. - The pincer.</v>

31
00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:27.675
(She's about to have a chance to achieve the fantasy.)

32
00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:31.114
(Do we catch the coconut crabs when we see them?)

33
00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:32.444
Yes, we must catch them by all means.

34
00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:33.754
(Do we put them in our bag?)

35
00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:35.455
<v ->Yes. - The holes are already dug.</v>

36
00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:38.554
(She's been looking for coconut crabs from day one.)

37
00:01:39.024 --> 00:01:42.254
(In the midst of her wandering in the jungle,)

38
00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:46.765
(her passion for coconut crabs didn't dampen.)

39
00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:51.965
(To Se Ri, it was the reason to survive.)

40
00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:57.944
(You are angry, right?)

41
00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:00.944
(She has been waiting for this moment.)

42
00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:05.485
(Se Ri attacks its pincers with a branch.)

43
00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:09.615
(Power up)

44
00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:12.155
Come on out.

45
00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:13.525
(It won't budge.)

46
00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:15.454
It's angry.

47
00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.465
I am getting angry.

48
00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:24.965
(It grabbed the branch.)

49
00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:26.535
<v ->I got it. - You got it.</v>

50
00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:28.435
Drag it out.

51
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:32.845
(It runs away again.)

52
00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:35.315
(It makes a retreat.)

53
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:40.984
(It was close.)

54
00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.655
Let's see which one of us wins.

55
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:50.565
It was a difficult task. Since we were way above it,

56
00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:52.424
we couldn't reach it.

57
00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:55.435
It refused to come out of the hole.

58
00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:58.335
If I start a task, I must complete it.

59
00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:04.805
Why are you aggravating me? Come on out.

60
00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:08.014
It's coming out.

61
00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:11.785
I got it.

62
00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:15.085
(The coconut crab gets dragged out once again.)

63
00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:17.685
<v ->I got it. - She got it.</v>

64
00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:19.384
You got it.

65
00:03:20.694 --> 00:03:21.754
I got it.

66
00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:24.565
(She drops it again.)

67
00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:27.595
Why did it go into a different hole?

68
00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:29.595
Was there a hole on the opposite side?

69
00:03:30.604 --> 00:03:35.035
(The coconut crab goes into the different hole.)

70
00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:39.504
There was a hole on the opposite side.

71
00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:41.944
What should we do? Did it go into the hole?

72
00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:43.914
<v ->Can you see it? - There it is.</v>

73
00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:45.145
I knew there was a hole.

74
00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.754
<v ->It went deeper than the last time. - It's covering its body.</v>

75
00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.224
(He gets up.)

76
00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:55.324
(Kang Nam suddenly heads somewhere.)

77
00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:57.395
Se Ri took out the coconut crab,

78
00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:59.965
but it went into a hole on the opposite side.

79
00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:02.435
I went to the other side.

80
00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:04.004
(Kang Nam goes to the other side to check.)

81
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:06.104
Hold on. There is a hole.

82
00:04:07.674 --> 00:04:08.704
(Taking a peek)

83
00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:10.704
<v ->It's here. - Really?</v>

84
00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:11.905
<v ->Is it there? - I can see its back.</v>

85
00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:13.845
<v ->Shove it. - Do you see its back? Shove it.</v>

86
00:04:13.845 --> 00:04:15.715
I will shove it.

87
00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:18.684
It looks so cute. Look at its butt.

88
00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:20.515
Do you see its butt?

89
00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:22.854
(Cute)

90
00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:25.554
I will hit its butt.

91
00:04:25.554 --> 00:04:26.554
(Kang Nam aims for the coconut crab's butt.)

92
00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:27.825
Hold on. Its butt...

93
00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:29.595
Push it from there.

94
00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:31.765
<v ->We can't push it. - We pushed as far as we can.</v>

95
00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:33.564
Can you grab its butt and pull it out?

96
00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.164
<v ->I will pull it out. - Hold on.</v>

97
00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:36.765
<v ->Is it coming out? - Hold on.</v>

98
00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:38.035
(He approaches it carefully to pull it out.)

99
00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:39.164
Keep pushing it from that side.

100
00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:40.205
(He approaches it carefully to pull it out.)

101
00:04:40.974 --> 00:04:42.035
I got it.

102
00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:45.705
(He grabs its body.)

103
00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:50.314
(The coconut crab finally comes out of the hole.)

104
00:04:50.314 --> 00:04:51.385
<v ->It came out. - Did it come out?</v>

105
00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:52.385
It came out.

106
00:04:52.984 --> 00:04:54.015
He got it.

107
00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:56.755
<v ->Where is the bag? - The bag.</v>

108
00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:57.825
Here it is.

109
00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:01.025
He got it. We need to go that way.

110
00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:02.155
(I am on my way.)

111
00:05:02.455 --> 00:05:04.265
Here you go.

112
00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:05.494
(They give him the bag to put the coconut crab inside.)

113
00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:07.664
<v ->Use the branch. - How do I put it inside the bag?</v>

114
00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:10.465
<v ->It's going back into the hole. - It's going into the hole.</v>

115
00:05:12.335 --> 00:05:13.374
Pull it out.

116
00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:16.374
(Kang Nam stops the coconut crab from running with his hands.)

117
00:05:16.374 --> 00:05:18.205
(Pulling out)

118
00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:20.775
Watch your hands.

119
00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:22.374
(Kang Nam, be careful.)

120
00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:26.244
I broke its leg.

121
00:05:27.054 --> 00:05:28.385
(The coconut crab breaks its leg to go into the hole.)

122
00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:30.885
All right. There you go.

123
00:05:31.554 --> 00:05:34.095
<v ->Step on it. - How do I do this?</v>

124
00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:37.064
Hold on. I can grab its pincers.

125
00:05:37.564 --> 00:05:38.564
(He grabs its pincers from behind.)

126
00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:40.095
I can grab its pincers. Open it.

127
00:05:40.994 --> 00:05:42.164
This is incredible.

128
00:05:42.494 --> 00:05:44.205
Make its head go in first. Hold on.

129
00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:46.064
(They finally caught a coconut crab.)

130
00:05:46.064 --> 00:05:48.734
Be careful when you catch it. We caught it.

131
00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:51.945
<v ->We caught it. - We caught it.</v>

132
00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:53.445
(It was the greatest wish of Byung Man's Tribe.)

133
00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:57.414
It was so difficult to catch one. The one I saw on TV was very big.

134
00:05:58.414 --> 00:05:59.814
It's fascinating.

135
00:06:00.414 --> 00:06:01.814
It looks like a spider.

136
00:06:02.554 --> 00:06:04.684
I saw people catch a big one on TV.

137
00:06:04.684 --> 00:06:05.724
(Is this a dream or reality?)

138
00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:09.695
When I saw it after hard work, I was fascinated.

139
00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:13.635
I had only seen it on TV before. I saw it for real and hunted it.

140
00:06:13.994 --> 00:06:15.095
I was very expectant.

141
00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:18.234
I could see the coconut crab's butt.

142
00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:19.505
(They caught it thanks to it cute and plump butt.)

143
00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:20.775
It was right there.

144
00:06:21.535 --> 00:06:22.604
I could see it.

145
00:06:22.974 --> 00:06:24.974
I pulled it out with my hands.

146
00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:26.345
I grabbed it.

147
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:27.414
(Their experience and spirit led to good results.)

148
00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:28.515
I grabbed its butt with my hands.

149
00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:30.285
It was right there.

150
00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:33.955
Good work, Kang Nam.

151
00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:35.054
<v ->Let's go. - Let's go.</v>

152
00:06:35.054 --> 00:06:36.054
Let's go.

153
00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:38.924
<v ->Hey, there is a leg. - What?</v>

154
00:06:38.924 --> 00:06:41.224
That's right. We should take the leg.

155
00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:43.124
<v ->My goodness. - When did it fall out?</v>

156
00:06:43.124 --> 00:06:44.965
It fell out when it was struggling.

157
00:06:46.994 --> 00:06:49.664
Since we came out this far, we should catch another one.

158
00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:51.005
Let's catch another one.

159
00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:53.434
Let's catch all of them.

160
00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:58.345
(They become confident after catching one coconut crab.)

161
00:06:58.345 --> 00:07:00.414
Coconut crabs aren't hidden, are they?

162
00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:01.474
(Everyone searches for coconut crabs.)

163
00:07:02.674 --> 00:07:05.114
(Se Ri combs through the area.)

164
00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:06.655
My goodness.

165
00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:09.515
(Did she find it already?)

166
00:07:10.124 --> 00:07:11.155
It's a baby.

167
00:07:11.554 --> 00:07:14.695
It looks like the hermit crabs we saw at the beach.

168
00:07:14.994 --> 00:07:16.195
How fascinating!

169
00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:19.695
Does this baby grow into a big coconut crab?

170
00:07:20.335 --> 00:07:21.364
(It sounds like she is swearing.)

171
00:07:21.364 --> 00:07:22.434
This must be its home.

172
00:07:22.564 --> 00:07:25.205
It made a nest...

173
00:07:25.804 --> 00:07:27.335
with coconut shells.

174
00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:29.374
It must have left the shells after eating coconuts.

175
00:07:29.535 --> 00:07:32.845
Coconut crabs don't live in a secluded place, do they?

176
00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:35.244
She is right.

177
00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:38.585
It looks similar to the hermit crabs...

178
00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:40.285
they saw on the beach.

179
00:07:40.814 --> 00:07:42.614
To coconut crabs, the home...

180
00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:45.484
isn't the land, but the sea. Did you know that?

181
00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:48.854
When the female coconut crab's eggs hatch,

182
00:07:48.854 --> 00:07:51.825
it goes to the sea and releases the zoea.

183
00:07:52.624 --> 00:07:55.635
Once they become a certain size, they come back to the beach...

184
00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:57.965
and grow in empty shells.

185
00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.674
When they become adults in a year or two,

186
00:08:01.674 --> 00:08:03.174
they throw away the shell...

187
00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.374
and make a nest between the rocks.

188
00:08:05.374 --> 00:08:07.614
<v ->Look at this. - After being born at the sea,</v>

189
00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:09.275
coconut crabs live on the land...

190
00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:12.244
and go back to the sea to lay eggs.

191
00:08:12.945 --> 00:08:16.184
The more we know, the more fascinating it becomes.

192
00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:20.924
It's hiding. It must be scared.

193
00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:23.325
Does it bite?

194
00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:24.825
(Se Ri takes a look at the baby coconut crab.)

195
00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:25.825
I got it.

196
00:08:25.825 --> 00:08:27.564
(Screaming)

197
00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:29.564
It's a baby.

198
00:08:30.734 --> 00:08:33.035
(Dangling)

199
00:08:35.475 --> 00:08:36.475
(She is scared out of her wits.)

200
00:08:36.475 --> 00:08:37.475
How scary!

201
00:08:37.574 --> 00:08:39.674
(The baby coconut crab makes the queen of golf scared.)

202
00:08:39.674 --> 00:08:41.344
It looks like a hermit crab.

203
00:08:42.074 --> 00:08:44.584
It looks exactly like a hermit crab. Look at this.

204
00:08:44.584 --> 00:08:45.615
It's our first time to see its home.

205
00:08:45.615 --> 00:08:47.015
(Throwing)

206
00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:49.985
My goodness. I am sorry. What should I do?

207
00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:52.054
(I am sorry. Please wake up.)

208
00:08:52.054 --> 00:08:53.725
Did it pass out? Did it die?

209
00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:56.054
Hey.

210
00:08:56.054 --> 00:08:57.424
(It's dizzy.)

211
00:08:57.424 --> 00:09:00.094
Are you okay? What should I do?

212
00:09:01.495 --> 00:09:02.934
Is this where they live?

213
00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:06.064
Is there a bigger nest?

214
00:09:07.235 --> 00:09:08.475
(Leaning in)

215
00:09:08.475 --> 00:09:09.704
Where is your mom?

216
00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:12.875
(Scared)

217
00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:15.914
This one looks like your aunt.

218
00:09:15.914 --> 00:09:18.214
(Is it the baby coconut crab's aunt?)

219
00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:21.554
Will they run away if we are loud?

220
00:09:21.554 --> 00:09:22.714
(I need to run away. She is too scary.)

221
00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:24.385
Don't they feed at night?

222
00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:27.755
Perhaps there are more. I should take a look around.

223
00:09:28.324 --> 00:09:31.664
It would be nice if we have one crab for each person.

224
00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:34.395
It's a nest.

225
00:09:34.395 --> 00:09:36.294
(Kang Nam and Chun Hee found the nest as well.)

226
00:09:36.294 --> 00:09:37.704
It's a nest.

227
00:09:38.605 --> 00:09:39.605
(Where are you?)

228
00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:41.704
It's a nest. There must be a coconut crab nearby.

229
00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:43.905
You know,

230
00:09:44.804 --> 00:09:46.645
it's difficult to find them.

231
00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:48.645
(Coconut crabs are difficult to find and catch.)

232
00:09:51.285 --> 00:09:53.954
<v ->It's over there. - Did you find it? Where is it?</v>

233
00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:55.684
<v ->Is it over there? - Yes.</v>

234
00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:57.054
<v ->Did you find it? - Yes.</v>

235
00:09:57.054 --> 00:09:58.084
<v ->Is it big? - Come over here.</v>

236
00:09:58.554 --> 00:10:00.924
<v ->It's down there. - Where?</v>

237
00:10:01.324 --> 00:10:03.365
It's down there. Go that way.

238
00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:04.964
There.

239
00:10:05.424 --> 00:10:07.995
<v ->It's going under the rock. - Did it go under the rock?</v>

240
00:10:08.265 --> 00:10:09.294
It's going under the rock.

241
00:10:09.294 --> 00:10:10.304
(Is the coconut crab going under the rock?)

242
00:10:10.304 --> 00:10:11.334
There.

243
00:10:12.235 --> 00:10:13.875
<v ->I don't see it. - There it goes.</v>

244
00:10:14.304 --> 00:10:16.875
<v ->Pardon? Where is it? - I am not lying.</v>

245
00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:17.975
(It's not a lie. Look over there.)

246
00:10:17.975 --> 00:10:20.015
There. There it is.

247
00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:21.015
<v ->What? - There.</v>

248
00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:22.174
(They look between the crevice as Chun Hee asks.)

249
00:10:22.174 --> 00:10:24.684
<v ->There. - There it is.</v>

250
00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:27.054
How did you spot it?

251
00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:29.554
There is an opening. Will you choose that one?

252
00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:31.155
It grabbed the branch.

253
00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:34.625
(The coconut crab shows aggression towards the branch.)

254
00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:37.025
Its pincer is bigger than the last one.

255
00:10:37.025 --> 00:10:38.225
(It's bigger than the last one.)

256
00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:39.294
Is it big?

257
00:10:39.294 --> 00:10:40.564
(They become expectant.)

258
00:10:40.564 --> 00:10:41.594
Is it bigger than this one?

259
00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:46.064
You have nowhere to go. Come on out.

260
00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:48.334
It's going further inside.

261
00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:50.574
Don't go inside. Pull it out.

262
00:10:51.605 --> 00:10:54.375
I am on a hunt this time.

263
00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:56.684
I will catch this one.

264
00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:02.985
(It's hard to reach inside the narrow crevice.)

265
00:11:02.985 --> 00:11:05.184
<v ->It's fighting back. - It was so close.</v>

266
00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:07.294
(The coconut crab resists vehemently.)

267
00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:08.655
It's very strong.

268
00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:14.135
Grab it. Go on and grab it.

269
00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:16.064
I got you. I got you.

270
00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:18.635
Come on out. Grab it tight.

271
00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:20.204
My gosh. It's stuck.

272
00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:22.334
Is it resisting?

273
00:11:24.145 --> 00:11:25.444
(Slipping)

274
00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:28.245
It's completely stuck.

275
00:11:29.044 --> 00:11:30.184
<v ->It's stuck, right? - Yes.</v>

276
00:11:30.914 --> 00:11:32.844
I bet it wants us to take it out.

277
00:11:33.314 --> 00:11:34.515
It's trapped.

278
00:11:34.515 --> 00:11:35.714
<v ->It's completely trapped. - Yes.</v>

279
00:11:36.584 --> 00:11:37.625
Should I move the rock?

280
00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:40.294
(Should I move the rock?)

281
00:11:40.294 --> 00:11:42.125
I think this rock will move.

282
00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:47.094
(Chun Hee approaches it after moving the rock.)

283
00:11:47.135 --> 00:11:48.434
(Give it all you've got.)

284
00:11:48.434 --> 00:11:51.405
<v ->You're Hulk. - We have to catch this.</v>

285
00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:53.735
(He's very motivated.)

286
00:11:53.735 --> 00:11:55.875
My gosh. Good job, Chun Hee.

287
00:11:57.044 --> 00:11:59.405
(This is where the coconut crab is.)

288
00:11:59.405 --> 00:12:01.375
<v ->It's like a rescue operation. - It's huge.</v>

289
00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:03.285
(The obstacles get removed.)

290
00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:04.584
You still won't come out?

291
00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:10.025
I might get stuck here.

292
00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:12.885
You still won't come out?

293
00:12:12.885 --> 00:12:15.155
(This man got stuck in between the rocks in 15 minutes.)

294
00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.995
(This is his first time hunting in the jungle.)

295
00:12:21.464 --> 00:12:24.235
(It's a desperate pursuit.)

296
00:12:26.934 --> 00:12:28.535
(An earnest hunting story)

297
00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:30.044
This is hard.

298
00:12:30.044 --> 00:12:32.645
(A Boy in Between the Rocks)

299
00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:35.115
(Who are you?)

300
00:12:35.115 --> 00:12:36.344
We'll see.

301
00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:42.015
<v ->It's stuck here. - I think you can go in.</v>

302
00:12:43.785 --> 00:12:46.054
(Chun Hee and the coconut crab)

303
00:12:46.054 --> 00:12:48.454
(They're only 50cm apart.)

304
00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:53.434
Let's stop this.

305
00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.135
Come out.

306
00:12:56.035 --> 00:12:59.164
(It doesn't intend to.)

307
00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:03.704
Try to catch its pincers. Doesn't it work?

308
00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:04.844
Can't you hold its pincers?

309
00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:06.375
Hold its pincers?

310
00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:08.574
Yes, hold them and pull them out.

311
00:13:09.074 --> 00:13:10.084
(Chun Hee tries again.)

312
00:13:10.084 --> 00:13:11.485
<v ->Watch your hand. - It sounds good.</v>

313
00:13:11.485 --> 00:13:12.515
(My gosh!)

314
00:13:12.515 --> 00:13:13.584
<v ->Watch your hand. - What's wrong?</v>

315
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:14.584
(Be careful.)

316
00:13:14.584 --> 00:13:15.584
No, it's dangerous.

317
00:13:15.584 --> 00:13:16.755
(He takes caution.)

318
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:17.785
I'm sorry.

319
00:13:18.454 --> 00:13:19.855
<v ->It's coming out. - It's coming out.</v>

320
00:13:19.855 --> 00:13:21.824
(The coconut crab gets dragged out after a long battle.)

321
00:13:22.954 --> 00:13:25.895
You did it. My gosh, hold on.

322
00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:28.135
<v ->Right before... - Be careful.</v>

323
00:13:28.135 --> 00:13:29.834
(They all grab it.)

324
00:13:30.934 --> 00:13:32.304
<v ->I'm so tired. - Goodness.</v>

325
00:13:32.304 --> 00:13:33.405
(My gosh!)

326
00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:34.804
<v ->The crab. - Hey.</v>

327
00:13:35.074 --> 00:13:36.334
(It resists fiercely.)

328
00:13:36.334 --> 00:13:38.444
<v ->Where's the net? - It's behind you.</v>

329
00:13:38.444 --> 00:13:39.605
<v ->What? - Like this?</v>

330
00:13:40.044 --> 00:13:41.714
<v ->Like this? - Yes, it can't use its hands then.</v>

331
00:13:41.714 --> 00:13:42.775
(Chun Hee captures it as well.)

332
00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:45.444
(He captures the coconut crab with an iron will.)

333
00:13:45.444 --> 00:13:48.355
<v ->That was amazing, Chun Hee. - It's still a baby.</v>

334
00:13:49.584 --> 00:13:50.924
I'm sorry.

335
00:13:51.324 --> 00:13:54.125
(I'm sorry. I'll let go of you.)

336
00:13:56.155 --> 00:13:57.164
Let go.

337
00:13:57.164 --> 00:13:58.164
(It's strong.)

338
00:13:58.164 --> 00:14:00.934
(They put it in a net.)

339
00:14:01.365 --> 00:14:03.704
That's it. We caught it.

340
00:14:03.964 --> 00:14:05.265
How do we get back?

341
00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.035
It's mad.

342
00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:09.574
(They finally hunted in the jungle.)

343
00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:12.844
After an hour of struggle,

344
00:14:12.844 --> 00:14:15.375
the members manage to catch a coconut crab.

345
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:17.885
Will they finally get to try...

346
00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:20.554
the best food in the jungle?

347
00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:21.855
We did so good.

348
00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:23.824
We did good.

349
00:14:24.454 --> 00:14:25.725
<v ->Let's go back. - Let's eat.</v>

350
00:14:25.725 --> 00:14:26.755
<v ->Let's eat. - I'm hungry.</v>

351
00:14:26.755 --> 00:14:27.855
Let's eat fast.

352
00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:29.495
Should we find two more?

353
00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:31.664
I want to but I'm hungry. Let's come back tomorrow.

354
00:14:31.664 --> 00:14:33.294
<v ->Let's go. - You want to come back tomorrow?</v>

355
00:14:33.294 --> 00:14:34.434
<v ->Tomorrow? - Yes.</v>

356
00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:35.694
<v ->Let's go. - Let's come back.</v>

357
00:14:35.934 --> 00:14:37.804
This is quite heavy.

358
00:14:37.804 --> 00:14:39.934
I think this is...

359
00:14:40.434 --> 00:14:41.804
about...

360
00:14:41.804 --> 00:14:42.804
(Lifting)

361
00:14:42.804 --> 00:14:43.975
How many kg is this?

362
00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:45.905
It's about 3kg.

363
00:14:45.905 --> 00:14:47.015
(Estimated weight is 3kg.)

364
00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:49.714
I think it's about 3kg.

365
00:14:49.714 --> 00:14:52.344
<v ->These 2 are about 3kg. - 3kg?</v>

366
00:14:52.615 --> 00:14:54.454
<v ->That's it? - Pardon?</v>

367
00:14:55.584 --> 00:14:56.924
It's only 3kg?

368
00:14:57.755 --> 00:15:00.294
Compared to what we had to do, it doesn't weigh a lot.

369
00:15:00.294 --> 00:15:01.755
(It's too light for Se Ri.)

370
00:15:03.025 --> 00:15:05.564
Is this big or small, Kang Nam?

371
00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:06.664
It's not...

372
00:15:06.664 --> 00:15:08.735
I think it's small. The one I saw...

373
00:15:08.735 --> 00:15:11.035
<v ->It was huge. - It had a wide chest.</v>

374
00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:12.164
You saw it?

375
00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:13.405
I saw it on TV.

376
00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:17.105
The sun went down while we caught this.

377
00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:20.245
I guess it takes minimum 30 minutes each.

378
00:15:20.275 --> 00:15:23.145
Open this and clean the inside.

379
00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:25.084
Take out the meat and put them together.

380
00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:27.015
<v ->Now? - In the coconut shell.</v>

381
00:15:27.015 --> 00:15:28.084
All right.

382
00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:29.785
Doesn't the soup come from the shell?

383
00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:31.684
<v ->No. - It's from the inside?</v>

384
00:15:31.684 --> 00:15:32.755
Yes.

385
00:15:33.084 --> 00:15:35.355
This is the intestine. Up to here.

386
00:15:35.395 --> 00:15:37.094
<v ->Take this out. - Okay.</v>

387
00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:40.135
<v ->Isn't this the intestine? - Pardon?</v>

388
00:15:40.135 --> 00:15:41.694
<v ->This is the intestine. - Yes.</v>

389
00:15:41.694 --> 00:15:43.365
<v ->We take this and throw it out? - Yes.</v>

390
00:15:43.564 --> 00:15:45.704
<v ->It's torso. - What do we take out?</v>

391
00:15:45.905 --> 00:15:48.135
<v ->The black stuff. - This?</v>

392
00:15:51.405 --> 00:15:52.405
(Tossing)

393
00:15:53.645 --> 00:15:54.745
(He gets it in one shot.)

394
00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:55.745
I'm good in this.

395
00:15:55.745 --> 00:15:56.814
(He gets it in one shot.)

396
00:15:57.785 --> 00:15:58.985
You're so good.

397
00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:01.155
You look like a local.

398
00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:02.255
(It looks automatic.)

399
00:16:05.684 --> 00:16:07.655
(Tossing)

400
00:16:08.924 --> 00:16:11.525
(He's focused on the gastropods.)

401
00:16:14.035 --> 00:16:15.064
This is great.

402
00:16:16.664 --> 00:16:18.135
How did you so many?

403
00:16:18.135 --> 00:16:19.135
(There are shells everywhere.)

404
00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:22.475
(It looks delicious.)

405
00:16:25.444 --> 00:16:26.914
(They cut up chili peppers.)

406
00:16:26.914 --> 00:16:28.015
<v ->This is enough, right? - Yes.</v>

407
00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:31.245
(It goes straight on the fire.)

408
00:16:35.454 --> 00:16:39.255
(It's a simple seafood soup...)

409
00:16:39.755 --> 00:16:41.454
<v ->I'll put this on top. - Go ahead.</v>

410
00:16:41.454 --> 00:16:43.725
(It's a simple seafood soup and roasted gastropods.)

411
00:16:47.194 --> 00:16:49.434
The kimchi is really good.

412
00:16:49.434 --> 00:16:51.005
It's the best idea.

413
00:16:52.735 --> 00:16:54.475
Doesn't it taste like pickled radish?

414
00:16:54.475 --> 00:16:55.635
Do you know what that is?

415
00:16:55.635 --> 00:16:56.775
(It's Chief's sweet and spicy papaya kimchi.)

416
00:16:56.844 --> 00:16:59.304
<v ->I'll give you more. - She loves it.</v>

417
00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:00.975
It's so good.

418
00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:02.615
It's addictive.

419
00:17:03.915 --> 00:17:05.685
(Let me see if it's cooked.)

420
00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:10.925
(It slides out.)

421
00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:11.985
It's good.

422
00:17:14.195 --> 00:17:17.824
This is roasted, Byung Man. See if it's okay.

423
00:17:20.195 --> 00:17:22.294
(It's chewy.)

424
00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:23.505
(Thumbs up)

425
00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:24.505
Is it okay?

426
00:17:25.935 --> 00:17:28.735
(The seafood soup is almost complete.)

427
00:17:28.735 --> 00:17:31.705
Did the other members get lost?

428
00:17:32.245 --> 00:17:33.775
When are they coming back?

429
00:17:35.344 --> 00:17:38.185
We might finish before they come. When are they coming?

430
00:17:38.785 --> 00:17:40.185
We might finish before they get back.

431
00:17:43.084 --> 00:17:45.525
(They're finally back.)

432
00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:49.094
<v ->It looks so good. - We found them all.</v>

433
00:17:49.995 --> 00:17:51.394
<v ->How many did you find? - We found two.</v>

434
00:17:51.394 --> 00:17:52.794
<v ->It looks great. - That's great.</v>

435
00:17:52.794 --> 00:17:54.864
<v ->Good job. - You were pretty late.</v>

436
00:17:54.995 --> 00:17:56.435
We were worried.

437
00:17:56.435 --> 00:17:58.404
<v ->I thought you were lost. - It was tough.</v>

438
00:17:58.465 --> 00:18:01.505
We weren't lost, but this wasn't better than where you went.

439
00:18:01.535 --> 00:18:03.175
Yesterday was nothing.

440
00:18:03.175 --> 00:18:05.175
<v ->Really? - Really?</v>

441
00:18:05.175 --> 00:18:07.044
<v ->How was it? - It was the worst.</v>

442
00:18:08.644 --> 00:18:09.745
It was the worst.

443
00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:10.745
(Throwing)

444
00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:11.985
I was so mad.

445
00:18:12.644 --> 00:18:14.884
(This flag)

446
00:18:14.985 --> 00:18:17.624
(Is she acting or is she really mad?)

447
00:18:18.025 --> 00:18:20.554
<v ->It must have been hard. - Great work.</v>

448
00:18:20.554 --> 00:18:21.624
(It must have been hard.)

449
00:18:22.425 --> 00:18:24.824
But the good thing is, after the sun set,

450
00:18:25.094 --> 00:18:26.594
something started moving.

451
00:18:27.535 --> 00:18:28.564
<v ->What started moving? - What do you mean?</v>

452
00:18:28.564 --> 00:18:30.465
After the sun set, things started moving.

453
00:18:30.604 --> 00:18:32.505
The pigs couldn't get in.

454
00:18:32.604 --> 00:18:35.005
<v ->There were many mosquitoes. - Is it a bat?</v>

455
00:18:35.134 --> 00:18:36.435
We caught this.

456
00:18:37.675 --> 00:18:38.775
We caught this.

457
00:18:38.804 --> 00:18:40.215
(Oh my gosh!)

458
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.675
<v ->That's amazing. What is it? - My gosh.</v>

459
00:18:42.675 --> 00:18:44.584
<v ->That's amazing. - We caught two.</v>

460
00:18:44.584 --> 00:18:45.644
(He puts it down.)

461
00:18:45.644 --> 00:18:46.685
The babies didn't come.

462
00:18:46.685 --> 00:18:47.814
<v ->It was... - Really?</v>

463
00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:50.054
<v ->They were in between rocks. - so hard...</v>

464
00:18:50.054 --> 00:18:51.755
<v ->to catch them. - This is awesome.</v>

465
00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:53.525
<v ->We got our clothes ripped. - Se Ri.</v>

466
00:18:53.525 --> 00:18:56.824
You really wanted the coconut crabs.

467
00:18:56.824 --> 00:18:58.495
<v ->I got goosebumps. - You finally caught them.</v>

468
00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:00.935
<v ->I got goosebumps. This is awesome. - Me too.</v>

469
00:19:00.935 --> 00:19:02.334
<v ->I got goosebumps too. - This is great.</v>

470
00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:03.564
<v ->So what did we have? - You're good.</v>

471
00:19:03.564 --> 00:19:06.134
<v ->Yesterday, - This is awesome.</v>

472
00:19:06.134 --> 00:19:07.775
<v ->we had crayfish, - We did good.</v>

473
00:19:07.775 --> 00:19:09.035
and we get to have coconut crabs today.

474
00:19:09.035 --> 00:19:10.904
<v ->We get to try all the main dishes. - That's right.</v>

475
00:19:10.904 --> 00:19:12.404
<v ->I'm so happy. - We only had pork before.</v>

476
00:19:12.404 --> 00:19:13.675
<v ->JB got a bad stomach. - Really?</v>

477
00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:15.814
<v ->You shouldn't be sick. - It's new.</v>

478
00:19:15.814 --> 00:19:17.314
<v ->It's spicy. - Really?</v>

479
00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:19.245
<v ->How about... - Let's salt it.</v>

480
00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:21.985
<v ->I'll prepare it. - My gosh, what's this?</v>

481
00:19:21.985 --> 00:19:23.384
(He takes a step back.)

482
00:19:23.384 --> 00:19:24.884
<v ->What's this? - You don't need to do anything.</v>

483
00:19:24.884 --> 00:19:26.154
Just...

484
00:19:26.154 --> 00:19:27.695
<v ->It's a coconut crab. - Don't we have to wash it?</v>

485
00:19:27.695 --> 00:19:28.794
(He keeps on exclaiming.)

486
00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:30.665
Just steam it.

487
00:19:31.064 --> 00:19:33.465
You found it? Did you catch it?

488
00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.294
<v ->We caught two. - That's awesome.</v>

489
00:19:35.294 --> 00:19:36.364
This is insane.

490
00:19:36.364 --> 00:19:37.735
I've never seen a coconut crab before.

491
00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:39.205
I've never seen it before.

492
00:19:39.705 --> 00:19:42.205
<v ->It was so strong. - You finally get to see it.</v>

493
00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:45.775
(After 3 days in the jungle,)

494
00:19:45.775 --> 00:19:47.144
(they finally meet the coconut crabs of their dreams.)

495
00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.844
<v ->Isn't this big? - It is.</v>

496
00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:50.114
The ones I saw...

497
00:19:50.114 --> 00:19:53.314
(This will get rid of their fatigue.)

498
00:19:53.314 --> 00:19:54.814
We need a hammer.

499
00:19:55.114 --> 00:19:56.624
<v ->It's so big. - This is awesome.</v>

500
00:19:56.624 --> 00:19:59.455
<v ->How can we eat this? - You have to hit it.</v>

501
00:19:59.455 --> 00:20:00.695
(Climbing)

502
00:20:00.894 --> 00:20:02.324
(It's a wild crab, so it can climb trees.)

503
00:20:02.324 --> 00:20:04.824
<v ->It can climb trees. - That's how it climbs.</v>

504
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.564
What is it doing? It's exercising.

505
00:20:06.564 --> 00:20:08.265
(He's fascinated.)

506
00:20:09.134 --> 00:20:11.334
It has pincers on its back legs too.

507
00:20:12.364 --> 00:20:13.834
It has pincers on the back too.

508
00:20:13.834 --> 00:20:15.005
(Coconut crabs can hold 30kg of load with their pincers.)

509
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.874
It's crossing now.

510
00:20:17.104 --> 00:20:20.175
I've never seen them crawling before.

511
00:20:21.015 --> 00:20:22.144
Coconut crabs...

512
00:20:23.544 --> 00:20:24.844
It's tightrope walking.

513
00:20:24.844 --> 00:20:26.384
(It's a feast with coconut crabs and clam soup.)

514
00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:28.685
We have a soup too. This is nice.

515
00:20:31.624 --> 00:20:35.255
(They start cooking the main dish.)

516
00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:39.935
(They pour water inside the foil pan and cover it up.)

517
00:20:40.165 --> 00:20:42.864
<v ->Put it on the fire. - Okay.</v>

518
00:20:42.864 --> 00:20:45.564
Hold on. Don't do it yet. We'll put this on top first.

519
00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:49.945
(They put it on the fire and wait for it to get cooked.)

520
00:20:52.304 --> 00:20:53.814
We have to make sure it doesn't escape.

521
00:20:54.374 --> 00:20:58.114
<v ->We finally get to have it. - I didn't think we'd get to it.</v>

522
00:20:58.114 --> 00:21:00.084
<v ->Have you tried it? - Yes.</v>

523
00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:01.985
<v ->What does it taste like? - Is it good?</v>

524
00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:04.685
<v ->I can't even explain it in words. - Is this better or the crayfish?</v>

525
00:21:04.854 --> 00:21:06.725
If you go to a good restaurant...

526
00:21:06.794 --> 00:21:09.054
and eat, it's really good.

527
00:21:09.054 --> 00:21:10.594
That's why you know it's a good restaurant.

528
00:21:10.594 --> 00:21:12.294
<v ->This is like that. - It's good.</v>

529
00:21:12.294 --> 00:21:14.894
It's really good.

530
00:21:14.995 --> 00:21:16.665
They get cooked fast.

531
00:21:17.104 --> 00:21:18.864
<v ->Is this better than the crayfish? - You can take it out.</v>

532
00:21:18.864 --> 00:21:20.735
<v ->This is better. - Really?</v>

533
00:21:20.735 --> 00:21:22.535
It's all cooked.

534
00:21:22.705 --> 00:21:24.104
<v ->Already? - Yes.</v>

535
00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:25.644
Let me see.

536
00:21:25.644 --> 00:21:27.644
(Let me see my babies.)

537
00:21:27.644 --> 00:21:29.344
<v ->Look at the color. - It's done.</v>

538
00:21:29.844 --> 00:21:33.154
<v ->That was quick. - It's still hot.</v>

539
00:21:33.154 --> 00:21:34.314
Really? I can smell it.

540
00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:35.554
<v ->I can smell it. - Bring the clam soup, Kang Nam.</v>

541
00:21:36.554 --> 00:21:38.225
<v ->Bring the clam soup. - Do we have soup?</v>

542
00:21:38.485 --> 00:21:41.955
<v ->We get to eat so well today. - I'll open this.</v>

543
00:21:42.725 --> 00:21:44.094
We get to cook in Cook Islands.

544
00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.094
<v ->Everything we wanted came true. - This is Cook Islands.</v>

545
00:21:46.094 --> 00:21:47.695
<v ->We only cooked. - Pardon?</v>

546
00:21:47.695 --> 00:21:50.005
<v ->That's why it's Cook Islands. - That's true.</v>

547
00:21:50.005 --> 00:21:51.435
(Exclaiming)

548
00:21:51.765 --> 00:21:52.834
I'm not good at cooking.

549
00:21:53.035 --> 00:21:55.334
(Se Ri wasn't paying attention, but she rushes to it.)

550
00:21:55.334 --> 00:21:57.705
<v ->This is amazing. - It worked out.</v>

551
00:21:57.705 --> 00:21:59.074
<v ->It's cooked. - Smell that.</v>

552
00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:00.745
It smells good.

553
00:22:01.114 --> 00:22:02.844
<v ->Smell it. - It's the coconut.</v>

554
00:22:02.844 --> 00:22:04.884
<v ->It smells like the coconut. - It's so good.</v>

555
00:22:04.884 --> 00:22:07.084
<v ->This is so fascinating. - We didn't even add coconut.</v>

556
00:22:07.084 --> 00:22:08.985
(It smells so good.)

557
00:22:12.584 --> 00:22:14.294
(The color and the smell are amazing.)

558
00:22:14.294 --> 00:22:15.624
This is amazing.

559
00:22:15.624 --> 00:22:17.525
Smell that. This is totally insane.

560
00:22:17.525 --> 00:22:19.364
(The steamed coconut crab will satisfy their five senses.)

561
00:22:19.364 --> 00:22:22.265
<v ->It looks good. - We didn't add anything in it,</v>

562
00:22:22.265 --> 00:22:25.334
<v ->but I can smell the coconut. - Look at the color.</v>

563
00:22:25.334 --> 00:22:26.904
(The clam soup and Byung Man's papaya kimchi...)

564
00:22:26.904 --> 00:22:27.904
(have a very clean taste.)

565
00:22:27.904 --> 00:22:29.374
You caught so many.

566
00:22:29.804 --> 00:22:31.904
<v ->We did. - We caught 200.</v>

567
00:22:32.374 --> 00:22:36.245
<v ->It was heavy. - We grabbed whatever we saw.</v>

568
00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:37.685
This is a lot.

569
00:22:37.685 --> 00:22:39.985
It's so plentiful today.

570
00:22:40.614 --> 00:22:43.654
You should try the coconut crab.

571
00:22:44.285 --> 00:22:45.455
You caught it.

572
00:22:45.455 --> 00:22:46.794
(Se Ri gets the honor of cutting the coconut crab.)

573
00:22:47.154 --> 00:22:49.255
That's right. You need a glove.

574
00:22:49.794 --> 00:22:52.965
That's right. Se Ri can't eat without gloves on.

575
00:22:53.094 --> 00:22:54.965
<v ->That's right. - What do you mean?</v>

576
00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:56.735
<v ->Don't forget. - She's eating.</v>

577
00:22:58.735 --> 00:23:02.374
(She ripped up the fish with gloves on.)

578
00:23:02.634 --> 00:23:05.275
<v ->Thank you. - I have a question, Se Ri.</v>

579
00:23:05.844 --> 00:23:07.715
When you were interviewed before coming here,

580
00:23:07.814 --> 00:23:09.945
I thought you said you hated eating something with gloves on.

581
00:23:10.644 --> 00:23:11.745
I'm just going to eat.

582
00:23:12.285 --> 00:23:14.084
I like this now. Are you satisfied?

583
00:23:15.114 --> 00:23:17.455
(This is the tale of Se Ri not keeping her words.)

584
00:23:18.654 --> 00:23:21.255
I'm going to open it for you guys.

585
00:23:21.695 --> 00:23:22.824
Because you caught it...

586
00:23:25.064 --> 00:23:27.035
(She puts her gloves on.)

587
00:23:27.035 --> 00:23:28.995
My gosh. It's a masterpiece.

588
00:23:29.465 --> 00:23:31.505
<v ->I'm getting goosebumps. - Eat the whole thing.</v>

589
00:23:31.505 --> 00:23:32.834
The soup too.

590
00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:35.535
(She finally gets to open it after watching it on TV for 6 years.)

591
00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:37.104
Do I hold it?

592
00:23:37.104 --> 00:23:39.175
Everything we wanted came true.

593
00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:41.374
This is tricky to break open.

594
00:23:44.084 --> 00:23:46.415
<v ->I have to break it. - It's tricky.</v>

595
00:23:46.515 --> 00:23:47.515
<v ->It's hard. - Right.</v>

596
00:23:47.515 --> 00:23:48.515
(She cuts everything now.)

597
00:23:48.515 --> 00:23:50.154
<v ->It looks hard. - Right.</v>

598
00:23:50.624 --> 00:23:51.785
(It suits her.)

599
00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:53.594
<v ->It's strong. - Right.</v>

600
00:23:53.594 --> 00:23:55.094
People told me not do things like this.

601
00:23:55.354 --> 00:23:56.465
I grabbed it naturally.

602
00:23:56.594 --> 00:23:58.094
You look like a restaurant owner.

603
00:23:58.094 --> 00:23:59.525
(Se Ri's Coconut Crabs Is Open.)

604
00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:01.165
This is my land.

605
00:24:01.165 --> 00:24:02.294
(Se Ri's Coconut Crabs Is Open.)

606
00:24:02.695 --> 00:24:03.705
This is my land.

607
00:24:04.665 --> 00:24:06.574
Is this good too?

608
00:24:06.574 --> 00:24:08.005
(Se Ri is the chef, and Byung Man is the sous-chef.)

609
00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:12.275
How is it when you compared it to that?

610
00:24:12.804 --> 00:24:14.775
I'll open this for you. Try it first.

611
00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:15.975
<v ->Try it first. - Thank you.</v>

612
00:24:16.114 --> 00:24:19.544
<v ->This is great. - Here you go.</v>

613
00:24:19.644 --> 00:24:20.755
<v ->My gosh. - In just three days...</v>

614
00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:22.485
<v ->My goodness. - My gosh.</v>

615
00:24:23.285 --> 00:24:24.285
It smells great.

616
00:24:24.285 --> 00:24:25.824
<v ->It's so good. - It'll even be better than beef.</v>

617
00:24:25.824 --> 00:24:26.955
(She smiles automatically.)

618
00:24:27.495 --> 00:24:29.094
Am I taking too long?

619
00:24:29.624 --> 00:24:31.195
<v ->Thank you. - It smells great.</v>

620
00:24:31.195 --> 00:24:35.294
(This is her first bite.)

621
00:24:35.294 --> 00:24:37.904
(Here it is.)

622
00:24:39.304 --> 00:24:40.505
(It's your wish come true.)

623
00:24:42.535 --> 00:24:43.675
(She takes a big bite.)

624
00:24:43.675 --> 00:24:45.074
<v ->It's so savory. - This is exciting.</v>

625
00:24:45.705 --> 00:24:46.715
It's great.

626
00:24:47.515 --> 00:24:49.415
How is it compared to yesterday's food?

627
00:24:50.185 --> 00:24:51.185
(Winking)

628
00:24:51.185 --> 00:24:52.415
This is so good.

629
00:24:53.654 --> 00:24:55.785
This is better.

630
00:24:56.785 --> 00:25:00.594
Before we ate it, we smelled it first.

631
00:25:01.495 --> 00:25:04.294
It smelled so good,

632
00:25:05.294 --> 00:25:08.294
but I put it in my mouth and before chewing it,

633
00:25:08.834 --> 00:25:10.364
it was like...

634
00:25:10.364 --> 00:25:12.965
the computer graphics on TV. It was sparkly.

635
00:25:12.965 --> 00:25:14.604
It was really like that.

636
00:25:15.205 --> 00:25:16.804
It was so fascinating.

637
00:25:20.415 --> 00:25:22.644
This is good. It's so good.

638
00:25:22.915 --> 00:25:25.144
<v ->It's good. - I wanted to try it.</v>

639
00:25:25.144 --> 00:25:26.185
(That's why people love coconut crabs.)

640
00:25:26.584 --> 00:25:27.685
I am speechless.

641
00:25:27.884 --> 00:25:31.054
It was so hard to catch it, so it's even better.

642
00:25:31.824 --> 00:25:32.884
Have some.

643
00:25:32.884 --> 00:25:33.995
(The jungle pays back for all the hard work you do.)

644
00:25:33.995 --> 00:25:34.995
Good.

645
00:25:36.054 --> 00:25:37.064
Is this the leg?

646
00:25:37.364 --> 00:25:38.564
(It's so meaty.)

647
00:25:38.564 --> 00:25:40.035
Do you mean this?

648
00:25:41.935 --> 00:25:43.364
My gosh. That's amazing.

649
00:25:44.735 --> 00:25:46.104
<v ->Didn't I peel this so well? - It's so good.</v>

650
00:25:46.104 --> 00:25:48.175
<v ->I'm an expert. - My goodness.</v>

651
00:25:48.175 --> 00:25:49.275
This.

652
00:25:49.275 --> 00:25:51.005
(You're right.)

653
00:25:51.005 --> 00:25:52.844
You peeled it so well.

654
00:25:53.445 --> 00:25:55.374
I can smell it here.

655
00:25:55.374 --> 00:25:57.245
(The coconut crab looks very firm.)

656
00:25:57.245 --> 00:25:58.245
It's good.

657
00:25:58.245 --> 00:25:59.814
Right? I like this.

658
00:25:59.814 --> 00:26:01.884
<v ->Cut it. Bite it off. - This is good.</v>

659
00:26:01.884 --> 00:26:03.285
I have to open it more.

660
00:26:03.285 --> 00:26:04.685
<v ->It looks good. - It's really good.</v>

661
00:26:04.685 --> 00:26:06.594
<v ->My gosh. - My gosh.</v>

662
00:26:07.154 --> 00:26:08.425
You guys worked so hard.

663
00:26:08.695 --> 00:26:09.794
They were even beaten by me.

664
00:26:09.794 --> 00:26:10.894
(He carefully takes a bite.)

665
00:26:17.304 --> 00:26:18.304
(I'm happy and thankful.)

666
00:26:18.304 --> 00:26:20.205
<v ->Is it good? - It's so good.</v>

667
00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:21.435
<v ->The meat... - It looks good.</v>

668
00:26:21.435 --> 00:26:22.834
This part is different.

669
00:26:23.005 --> 00:26:24.205
Thank you.

670
00:26:25.505 --> 00:26:26.915
The scent...

671
00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:28.515
Look at the meat.

672
00:26:29.314 --> 00:26:30.384
It's good.

673
00:26:30.715 --> 00:26:31.915
Right? It's different.

674
00:26:32.884 --> 00:26:35.154
<v ->It's so good. - We have a lot left.</v>

675
00:26:35.584 --> 00:26:36.584
<v ->Do we have more? - We have a lot left.</v>

676
00:26:36.584 --> 00:26:37.884
How many legs does it have?

677
00:26:39.084 --> 00:26:40.154
It's good.

678
00:26:40.794 --> 00:26:41.794
It's so good.

679
00:26:42.455 --> 00:26:44.265
Be careful.

680
00:26:44.995 --> 00:26:46.364
I'm so curious.

681
00:26:48.094 --> 00:26:49.094
Jong Hyun.

682
00:26:49.094 --> 00:26:50.304
(Where did your pride go?)

683
00:26:50.864 --> 00:26:53.064
I thought you don't eat food like this. Is it still good?

684
00:26:53.064 --> 00:26:56.104
(Jong Hyun was a picky eater.)

685
00:26:56.104 --> 00:26:57.544
<v ->This... - Is it really good?</v>

686
00:26:57.544 --> 00:26:58.644
How is it?

687
00:26:59.374 --> 00:27:01.374
What don't you like?

688
00:27:03.185 --> 00:27:06.044
<v ->I'll open it for you. - Try this.</v>

689
00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:08.415
<v ->I want to try it. - Try it seriously.</v>

690
00:27:09.785 --> 00:27:11.185
Let me finish this first.

691
00:27:12.354 --> 00:27:13.594
(Exclaiming)

692
00:27:13.594 --> 00:27:15.794
It's really good.

693
00:27:15.794 --> 00:27:17.965
This is really good.

694
00:27:18.824 --> 00:27:20.634
Compared to yesterday's crayfish...

695
00:27:20.634 --> 00:27:21.695
(They're satisfied with the quantity and the quality.)

696
00:27:21.695 --> 00:27:25.265
It's a lot better. This is really good.

697
00:27:26.064 --> 00:27:27.904
I opened it so well.

698
00:27:27.904 --> 00:27:30.544
My gosh. You can hold it like this and eat.

699
00:27:30.904 --> 00:27:33.245
(It's a thick pincer.)

700
00:27:33.245 --> 00:27:34.745
Take this out quickly.

701
00:27:35.015 --> 00:27:36.915
Thank you. I'm so happy.

702
00:27:38.245 --> 00:27:40.084
<v ->Where did he go? - This is so good.</v>

703
00:27:40.084 --> 00:27:41.515
This is so delicious.

704
00:27:42.415 --> 00:27:43.824
He must have gone to toilet.

705
00:27:44.255 --> 00:27:46.285
It's so good that it makes me happy.

706
00:27:46.554 --> 00:27:49.624
<v ->It's really good. - I'm happy.</v>

707
00:27:49.624 --> 00:27:51.094
(She smacks her lips.)

708
00:27:51.094 --> 00:27:52.564
<v ->This is good. - I'm shocked.</v>

709
00:27:52.824 --> 00:27:54.564
<v ->This is really good. - It's good.</v>

710
00:27:54.564 --> 00:27:56.294
I wanted to try it. This is how it tastes.

711
00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:01.074
(What would we have done without this?)

712
00:28:01.074 --> 00:28:02.205
It's good.

713
00:28:03.404 --> 00:28:04.404
This is even better.

714
00:28:04.404 --> 00:28:06.715
<v ->This is no joke. - This is better than the crayfish.</v>

715
00:28:07.015 --> 00:28:08.245
It's totally different.

716
00:28:08.475 --> 00:28:10.485
Try this one, Se Ri.

717
00:28:10.485 --> 00:28:12.515
<v ->There's so much meat. - My gosh.</v>

718
00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:13.755
<v ->It looks so good. - Hey.</v>

719
00:28:13.755 --> 00:28:17.255
<v ->Look at this. - Eat it. You worked hard.</v>

720
00:28:17.985 --> 00:28:19.225
Go ahead.

721
00:28:19.525 --> 00:28:20.525
In one shot.

722
00:28:22.894 --> 00:28:26.265
(She takes a huge bite.)

723
00:28:26.265 --> 00:28:27.265
(It's her dream come true.)

724
00:28:27.265 --> 00:28:28.334
It's like a commercial.

725
00:28:34.804 --> 00:28:36.104
What's wrong?

726
00:28:36.705 --> 00:28:37.705
How is it?

727
00:28:38.275 --> 00:28:39.915
This looks like a scallop.

728
00:28:40.715 --> 00:28:43.215
<v ->It looks like a scallop. - This part...</v>

729
00:28:43.915 --> 00:28:45.044
is sweeter.

730
00:28:45.544 --> 00:28:46.554
<v ->It's sweet, right? - Yes.</v>

731
00:28:46.554 --> 00:28:48.515
<v ->It's sweet. - This is much sweeter.</v>

732
00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:51.185
I put it in my mouth, so I can't give it to you.

733
00:28:51.185 --> 00:28:52.255
No, I think it's okay.

734
00:28:52.255 --> 00:28:54.324
(No, I think it's okay.)

735
00:28:54.324 --> 00:28:55.455
(He steals it from her.)

736
00:28:55.455 --> 00:28:58.195
<v ->He's changed. - His personality changed.</v>

737
00:28:58.195 --> 00:29:00.665
<v ->You're not like this. - What don't you eat?</v>

738
00:29:00.665 --> 00:29:02.594
I thought you don't eat dirty food.

739
00:29:02.695 --> 00:29:04.205
It's okay. I'll eat it.

740
00:29:04.205 --> 00:29:06.634
<v ->You're not like this. - Do we just eat?</v>

741
00:29:06.634 --> 00:29:09.604
You said many times that you don't live like this.

742
00:29:10.175 --> 00:29:11.475
<v ->Is it good? - You said you're picky.</v>

743
00:29:11.844 --> 00:29:13.574
<v ->Is it good? - Can I have a bite?</v>

744
00:29:13.614 --> 00:29:15.344
<v ->You can smell wood. - Give me a small bite.</v>

745
00:29:15.475 --> 00:29:17.114
<v ->It smells like wood? - Yes.</v>

746
00:29:17.515 --> 00:29:20.114
<v ->Cut it. - This is not just one.</v>

747
00:29:21.084 --> 00:29:22.154
Look at that.

748
00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:23.624
Put it down.

749
00:29:24.084 --> 00:29:26.624
<v ->Try this, Se Ri. - This is the crab's intestine.</v>

750
00:29:26.624 --> 00:29:28.654
<v ->There's so much meat. - It looks so good.</v>

751
00:29:28.654 --> 00:29:29.925
Take this.

752
00:29:30.665 --> 00:29:32.925
<v ->It's good. - I wanted to try it.</v>

753
00:29:34.394 --> 00:29:35.995
I'm speechless. It's so good.

754
00:29:35.995 --> 00:29:38.935
It was so hard to catch it, so it's even better.

755
00:29:39.604 --> 00:29:40.735
Go ahead, Chun Hee.

756
00:29:40.935 --> 00:29:43.544
I'll think about it. I'm allergic to this.

757
00:29:43.544 --> 00:29:45.404
(He's allergic.)

758
00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:47.314
It's still so meaty.

759
00:29:48.175 --> 00:29:51.685
(Chun Hee cannot eat coconut fish because of his allergy.)

760
00:29:53.285 --> 00:29:57.054
Every time my family goes to eat shrimps or lobsters,

761
00:29:57.054 --> 00:29:59.084
I'm allergic, so I can't eat it.

762
00:29:59.084 --> 00:30:01.495
I tell them to eat, and I'll just watch.

763
00:30:01.794 --> 00:30:04.794
We end up eating something else, so my family...

764
00:30:05.195 --> 00:30:09.195
never goes to eat shrimps or crabs.

765
00:30:10.604 --> 00:30:12.134
Because I can't eat them.

766
00:30:13.175 --> 00:30:16.074
(He caught the coconut crabs, but he couldn't even have a bite.)

767
00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:18.844
(Scratching)

768
00:30:21.275 --> 00:30:24.084
<v ->I really want it. - Try some.</v>

769
00:30:24.084 --> 00:30:25.245
(I feel so bad for Chun Hee.)

770
00:30:25.245 --> 00:30:26.614
<v ->Try some. - It's different.</v>

771
00:30:26.654 --> 00:30:28.985
<v ->It tastes totally different. - This is so interesting.</v>

772
00:30:28.985 --> 00:30:30.485
(I want to know how that feels like.)

773
00:30:30.485 --> 00:30:32.084
<v ->Is it that good? - You haven't had any yet?</v>

774
00:30:32.084 --> 00:30:33.894
It's really good.

775
00:30:33.894 --> 00:30:35.794
The legs are chubby too.

776
00:30:35.794 --> 00:30:36.794
(I caught it, but I couldn't even touch it.)

777
00:30:36.794 --> 00:30:38.064
<v ->Here. - Here's more.</v>

778
00:30:38.624 --> 00:30:39.995
<v ->That's good. - It's unbelievable.</v>

779
00:30:39.995 --> 00:30:41.594
<v ->It's really good. - It's precious.</v>

780
00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:43.165
<v ->The coconut crab is. - This is amazing.</v>

781
00:30:43.165 --> 00:30:45.705
<v ->It was so hard though. - This and...</v>

782
00:30:46.205 --> 00:30:48.304
(Should I try this or not?)

783
00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:50.104
That looks good. If I eat this now,

784
00:30:50.104 --> 00:30:52.904
this is my first time eating crabs.

785
00:30:52.904 --> 00:30:54.044
It's good.

786
00:30:54.874 --> 00:30:58.985
(My goodness.)

787
00:30:58.985 --> 00:31:00.185
(I don't know.)

788
00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:01.685
This looks really good.

789
00:31:01.685 --> 00:31:02.985
(He stops hesitating and eats.)

790
00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:07.725
(He's amazed.)

791
00:31:08.294 --> 00:31:10.564
<v ->It's really good, right? - Isn't it the best?</v>

792
00:31:10.564 --> 00:31:12.124
<v ->Yes. - It's really, really good.</v>

793
00:31:13.094 --> 00:31:14.265
It's really good.

794
00:31:14.634 --> 00:31:16.834
<v ->The smell is different. - It's better.</v>

795
00:31:17.165 --> 00:31:18.505
I think this is better than lobster.

796
00:31:18.505 --> 00:31:21.535
As soon as it touches your tongue, it melts.

797
00:31:21.535 --> 00:31:22.535
Right.

798
00:31:23.844 --> 00:31:25.275
<v ->Is this what you meant? - The texture is great too.</v>

799
00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:27.715
<v ->What's that? - The intestine.</v>

800
00:31:27.814 --> 00:31:30.515
<v ->Eat it in one bite. - Eat it in one bite.</v>

801
00:31:32.144 --> 00:31:33.685
<v ->Take it in one bite. - Take it in one bite.</v>

802
00:31:33.685 --> 00:31:35.584
You worked so hard, Se Ri.

803
00:31:35.584 --> 00:31:37.824
Here you go. Who wants this?

804
00:31:37.824 --> 00:31:40.195
<v ->Kang Nam didn't eat any. - No, it's okay.</v>

805
00:31:40.195 --> 00:31:41.624
No, him. Chun Hee.

806
00:31:41.695 --> 00:31:44.564
<v ->I will eat it. - Chun Hee caught it.</v>

807
00:31:44.794 --> 00:31:46.324
I will eat it.

808
00:31:46.324 --> 00:31:48.064
<v ->Chun Hee caught it. - We need to break the shells.</v>

809
00:31:48.064 --> 00:31:50.165
<v ->You can share it. - Cut it.</v>

810
00:31:50.564 --> 00:31:52.535
<v ->Cut this one. - It's tasty.</v>

811
00:31:52.535 --> 00:31:53.904
I will break the shells.

812
00:31:53.904 --> 00:31:55.475
<v ->This meat is really tasty. - It's really tasty.</v>

813
00:31:55.475 --> 00:31:57.245
<v ->It's tasty. - Seriously.</v>

814
00:31:57.874 --> 00:32:00.344
This coconut crab struggled a lot. I hit it earlier.

815
00:32:00.344 --> 00:32:01.544
(Does he really have an allergy?)

816
00:32:05.314 --> 00:32:07.614
<v ->My goodness. - It's so tasty.</v>

817
00:32:08.814 --> 00:32:12.755
I could see why people are obsessed with coconut crabs.

818
00:32:13.824 --> 00:32:14.894
It tasted different.

819
00:32:15.654 --> 00:32:16.725
It was incredibly tasty.

820
00:32:17.465 --> 00:32:20.935
I thought to myself, "How does this taste so good?"

821
00:32:20.935 --> 00:32:24.465
"How does something from the nature..."

822
00:32:24.465 --> 00:32:25.735
"taste so good?"

823
00:32:26.475 --> 00:32:28.104
It only fed on coconuts.

824
00:32:28.104 --> 00:32:29.904
(He ate and ate.)

825
00:32:29.904 --> 00:32:31.175
I was fascinated.

826
00:32:32.445 --> 00:32:35.374
(It looks like he got over his allergy.)

827
00:32:36.415 --> 00:32:38.945
<v ->Is it okay for you to eat it? - I keep eating it.</v>

828
00:32:40.015 --> 00:32:42.114
<v ->Is it okay? - He is starved.</v>

829
00:32:42.654 --> 00:32:44.455
It's so tasty.

830
00:32:45.324 --> 00:32:48.324
<v ->I guess I am not allergic. - We got to try everything.</v>

831
00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:50.165
I guess I am not allergic.

832
00:32:51.465 --> 00:32:52.594
Is that it?

833
00:32:52.594 --> 00:32:53.864
<v ->Leave it. - It's the tail.</v>

834
00:32:53.864 --> 00:32:54.864
(Se Ri pulls the body apart.)

835
00:32:54.864 --> 00:32:57.104
(She is skilled.)

836
00:32:57.904 --> 00:32:58.965
There is more to eat.

837
00:32:59.735 --> 00:33:01.334
<v ->There is more to eat. - This is incredible.</v>

838
00:33:01.334 --> 00:33:04.475
It looks like Se Ri opened a restaurant.

839
00:33:04.475 --> 00:33:07.344
<v ->We're getting better every day. - She is getting faster.</v>

840
00:33:07.945 --> 00:33:09.144
She is the master of coconut crabs.

841
00:33:09.144 --> 00:33:10.344
Seriously.

842
00:33:10.344 --> 00:33:12.384
(Se Ri's coconut crabs are almost finished.)

843
00:33:13.044 --> 00:33:15.215
<v ->It's so tasty. - You know...</v>

844
00:33:15.215 --> 00:33:16.485
(The tastiest past, coconut crab innards appear.)

845
00:33:16.925 --> 00:33:17.955
<v ->This... - The innards.</v>

846
00:33:18.225 --> 00:33:19.324
The innards.

847
00:33:19.955 --> 00:33:21.354
Some people don't like it.

848
00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:22.495
(He desperately wants it.)

849
00:33:22.525 --> 00:33:24.465
This is coconut...

850
00:33:24.465 --> 00:33:25.695
(The meat is good.)

851
00:33:25.695 --> 00:33:28.134
Hold on. This is coconut crab innards.

852
00:33:28.594 --> 00:33:31.134
<v ->It looks delicious. - This is...</v>

853
00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:33.005
<v ->Se Ri, you should eat it. - You should eat it.</v>

854
00:33:33.005 --> 00:33:34.235
You worked hard today.

855
00:33:35.775 --> 00:33:37.275
Do we eat it as it is?

856
00:33:37.275 --> 00:33:38.705
(The one who loves coconut crabs, Se Ri takes the first bite.)

857
00:33:38.804 --> 00:33:42.945
(How does it taste?)

858
00:33:42.945 --> 00:33:44.144
(What?)

859
00:33:46.215 --> 00:33:47.285
<v ->It's a bit... - How is it?</v>

860
00:33:47.285 --> 00:33:48.915
(Sol Bin tastes it.)

861
00:33:49.285 --> 00:33:50.354
This is...

862
00:33:50.354 --> 00:33:51.455
(My goodness.)

863
00:33:52.054 --> 00:33:53.195
This is amazing.

864
00:33:53.294 --> 00:33:56.025
<v ->What is it? - Try it. It's absolutely delicious.</v>

865
00:33:56.324 --> 00:33:58.894
<v ->How do you eat that? - It's absolutely delicious.</v>

866
00:33:58.894 --> 00:33:59.965
It tastes...

867
00:33:59.965 --> 00:34:03.134
<v ->How can we eat that? - a bit bitter.</v>

868
00:34:03.634 --> 00:34:05.235
<v ->It tastes sweet as well. - It's really good.</v>

869
00:34:05.235 --> 00:34:07.005
We usually eat it with rice.

870
00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:08.875
We had one so far, right?

871
00:34:08.975 --> 00:34:10.904
(Sucking)

872
00:34:12.804 --> 00:34:14.645
<v ->We have another one. - Innards.</v>

873
00:34:15.415 --> 00:34:17.585
Innards are really tasty. It's better than marinated crabs.

874
00:34:17.585 --> 00:34:18.884
<v ->Really? Is it that tasty? - What's this?</v>

875
00:34:19.855 --> 00:34:22.054
<v ->I can't eat them. - There is a lot of meat.</v>

876
00:34:22.054 --> 00:34:23.114
<v ->Really? - I can't eat them.</v>

877
00:34:23.114 --> 00:34:24.855
You will end up eating them.

878
00:34:25.424 --> 00:34:26.424
Can't you eat them?

879
00:34:26.424 --> 00:34:28.424
I usually throw away the innards.

880
00:34:28.424 --> 00:34:30.665
<v ->Try them. - You are not a gourmet.</v>

881
00:34:31.395 --> 00:34:32.725
They are tastier than the marinated crab innards.

882
00:34:32.924 --> 00:34:34.165
What is this?

883
00:34:35.094 --> 00:34:37.634
(He succumbs to the innards in 0.1 seconds.)

884
00:34:37.634 --> 00:34:38.634
Opposite side.

885
00:34:39.234 --> 00:34:41.875
I thought it was a comedy skit.

886
00:34:42.274 --> 00:34:44.205
<v ->Seriously. - I got goosebumps.</v>

887
00:34:44.205 --> 00:34:46.174
They taste strange.

888
00:34:47.714 --> 00:34:49.774
They are like pasta sauce.

889
00:34:50.315 --> 00:34:52.714
<v ->He is funny. - Seriously.</v>

890
00:34:52.714 --> 00:34:54.654
<v ->My gosh. - This is the main dish...</v>

891
00:34:54.654 --> 00:34:56.015
<v ->and this is the side dish. - That's right.</v>

892
00:34:57.524 --> 00:34:58.554
Look at this. It's pasta.

893
00:34:58.554 --> 00:35:00.094
(Stretching)

894
00:35:00.094 --> 00:35:02.194
(Are these innards or cheese?)

895
00:35:02.194 --> 00:35:03.225
Open wide quickly.

896
00:35:03.864 --> 00:35:04.895
<v ->My gosh. - They look like noodles.</v>

897
00:35:04.895 --> 00:35:06.265
<v ->Come on. - Open wide.</v>

898
00:35:06.265 --> 00:35:07.594
<v ->Open wide. - Open wide.</v>

899
00:35:08.035 --> 00:35:09.634
<v ->What are those? - Innards.</v>

900
00:35:09.634 --> 00:35:11.265
(He inhales the innards.)

901
00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:12.335
They are delicious.

902
00:35:12.835 --> 00:35:15.375
<v ->With that... - Why are you taking them out?</v>

903
00:35:15.904 --> 00:35:17.944
<v ->What are you doing? - You should eat them.</v>

904
00:35:19.475 --> 00:35:20.475
He wants to cut them.

905
00:35:20.574 --> 00:35:22.214
<v ->He wants to savor them. - Are those innards?</v>

906
00:35:23.145 --> 00:35:24.185
(Tasty food should be shared.)

907
00:35:24.185 --> 00:35:26.315
<v ->Yes, they are. - They look like monkeys.</v>

908
00:35:26.315 --> 00:35:28.185
<v ->You guys are hilarious. - It looks like ramyeon.</v>

909
00:35:28.185 --> 00:35:30.024
(It's a beautiful sight.)

910
00:35:30.024 --> 00:35:31.285
Are you guys idol singers?

911
00:35:32.225 --> 00:35:34.455
<v ->Is it really good? - They are like noodles.</v>

912
00:35:34.455 --> 00:35:35.495
That's right.

913
00:35:35.754 --> 00:35:37.594
<v ->How do they taste? - They taste like seasoned pasta.</v>

914
00:35:38.395 --> 00:35:40.035
You are right. They taste like pasta.

915
00:35:41.435 --> 00:35:44.134
<v ->Are innards tastier than the meat? - Yes.</v>

916
00:35:47.475 --> 00:35:48.574
Dip the meat in innards.

917
00:35:49.904 --> 00:35:51.745
I guess I am not allergic.

918
00:35:54.245 --> 00:35:56.614
You end up eating everything well.

919
00:35:57.045 --> 00:35:59.085
(You can't fight against hunger.)

920
00:35:59.085 --> 00:36:00.585
You end up eating what you hate.

921
00:36:02.114 --> 00:36:04.355
How can food taste so good in the jungle?

922
00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:07.495
Eat kimchi from time to time. It's really delicious.

923
00:36:07.495 --> 00:36:09.395
<v ->Did we finish it? - Do you want kimchi?</v>

924
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:13.694
They eat Se Ri's dream dish, coconut crabs...

925
00:36:13.694 --> 00:36:16.705
and rinse their mouths with Byung Man's papaya kimchi.

926
00:36:17.205 --> 00:36:20.774
<v ->After some time, - They look happier than ever.</v>

927
00:36:20.774 --> 00:36:22.134
it tastes better.

928
00:36:22.134 --> 00:36:24.145
The longer the time passes, the spicier even it gets.

929
00:36:25.304 --> 00:36:26.344
Se Ri, are you happy?

930
00:36:27.045 --> 00:36:28.074
Are you happy?

931
00:36:28.515 --> 00:36:30.515
She keeps smiling. She feels very happy.

932
00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:32.145
She is happy.

933
00:36:32.145 --> 00:36:34.355
This is really tasty.

934
00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:39.424
Byung Man, we will gain weight. Right?

935
00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:42.625
You are eating a lot.

936
00:36:43.054 --> 00:36:45.464
I can do this for the rest of my life.

937
00:36:46.024 --> 00:36:47.995
This is the first time we had so much to eat.

938
00:36:48.734 --> 00:36:51.804
<v ->We have 2 flags left... - 2 flags.</v>

939
00:36:52.004 --> 00:36:53.634
<v ->to collect. - That's right.</v>

940
00:36:54.234 --> 00:36:57.605
In that case, as soon as the sun rises,

941
00:36:57.605 --> 00:36:58.705
<v ->go. - Go.</v>

942
00:36:59.274 --> 00:37:00.415
<v ->Will there be teams? - You should go.</v>

943
00:37:00.614 --> 00:37:01.674
<v ->Will there be teams? - You should go.</v>

944
00:37:01.674 --> 00:37:04.114
No. I don't want to do that.

945
00:37:04.114 --> 00:37:06.185
I am sorry. I shouldn't say this.

946
00:37:06.185 --> 00:37:08.085
However, I refuse for the first time. I can't go.

947
00:37:08.085 --> 00:37:09.415
Why not? You always listen to me.

948
00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:11.855
I can't go. I feel like I am dying.

949
00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:13.225
Kang Nam found all the flags.

950
00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:15.955
I feel like I am dying thanks to the past two days.

951
00:37:16.964 --> 00:37:18.225
(You did a good job.)

952
00:37:18.594 --> 00:37:20.995
Eating a meal puts me in a good mood.

953
00:37:21.234 --> 00:37:22.864
<v ->I am so happy. - I was nervous today, but...</v>

954
00:37:22.864 --> 00:37:24.935
<v ->We did a good job today. - Seriously.</v>

955
00:37:24.935 --> 00:37:26.634
(She already took off her gloves.)

956
00:37:27.234 --> 00:37:28.335
Why are we clapping?

957
00:37:28.504 --> 00:37:29.634
<v ->I just want to clap. - We did a good job.</v>

958
00:37:29.634 --> 00:37:31.674
We are clapping because we are happy.

959
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:34.145
I feel like my arms are in tatters. I can't move them freely.

960
00:37:34.145 --> 00:37:36.645
Do you feel naked without your gloves?

961
00:37:37.315 --> 00:37:39.685
<v ->You are embarrassed. - You are shy.</v>

962
00:37:39.685 --> 00:37:41.285
You are trying to hide your hands.

963
00:37:41.285 --> 00:37:43.524
You don't know what to do with your hands.

964
00:37:43.524 --> 00:37:44.625
You are shy.

965
00:37:45.424 --> 00:37:48.154
I should wear gloves from now on.

966
00:37:49.924 --> 00:37:52.694
I should always wear gloves from now on.

967
00:37:53.634 --> 00:37:57.234
(They wrap up their long day.)

968
00:37:58.234 --> 00:38:00.734
(Se Ri gets ready to go to bed.)

969
00:38:00.734 --> 00:38:02.975
(However...)

970
00:38:02.975 --> 00:38:04.174
Sol Bin.

971
00:38:04.944 --> 00:38:07.614
Sol Bin. Come here for a second.

972
00:38:07.915 --> 00:38:10.815
Give one to Chief Byung Man. He might use it.

973
00:38:11.245 --> 00:38:12.444
Chief Byung Man?

974
00:38:12.444 --> 00:38:14.654
Chun Hee and Hwan, too.

975
00:38:14.654 --> 00:38:16.924
<v ->I see what it is. - Yours is here.</v>

976
00:38:17.355 --> 00:38:18.384
Give it to them.

977
00:38:18.384 --> 00:38:21.125
<v ->It's what you gave me yesterday. - That's right.</v>

978
00:38:21.495 --> 00:38:22.924
I will give it to them.

979
00:38:23.824 --> 00:38:26.995
(Se Ri falls asleep after taking care of everyone.)

980
00:38:28.395 --> 00:38:32.634
(Chief Byung Man goes to bed after working hard all day.)

981
00:38:34.205 --> 00:38:36.105
(That's how the day ends...)

982
00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:38.375
(or not.)

983
00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:42.145
(Why are they wearing flippers at this hour?)

984
00:38:43.815 --> 00:38:47.685
We are determined to catch crayfish.

985
00:38:48.114 --> 00:38:49.554
(Crayfish?)

986
00:38:49.554 --> 00:38:50.924
<v ->Let's go. - Let's go.</v>

987
00:38:50.924 --> 00:38:52.225
<v ->Are you ready? - Yes.</v>

988
00:38:52.855 --> 00:38:54.495
(Chun Hee, JB, and Jong Hyun)

989
00:38:54.495 --> 00:38:57.295
If we swim too fast, fish will be startled.

990
00:38:57.295 --> 00:38:59.524
<v ->Swim slowly. - Swim slowly.</v>

991
00:38:59.524 --> 00:39:02.765
(Why are they going on a hunt at this hour?)

992
00:39:03.804 --> 00:39:04.864
That day,

993
00:39:05.234 --> 00:39:08.304
when I caught the coconut crab, I thought to myself,

994
00:39:08.804 --> 00:39:10.774
"Has the spirit of a hunter descended on me?"

995
00:39:11.145 --> 00:39:13.105
"Why am I hunting so well today?"

996
00:39:13.875 --> 00:39:16.174
I felt like I could catch anything.

997
00:39:16.174 --> 00:39:17.315
I thought to myself,

998
00:39:18.245 --> 00:39:20.355
"Won't I catch crayfish if I enter the water?"

999
00:39:21.685 --> 00:39:22.714
That's why I went into the water.

1000
00:39:23.554 --> 00:39:27.395
I felt like I would be able to do well.

1001
00:39:27.395 --> 00:39:30.324
I wanted to set an example.

1002
00:39:30.324 --> 00:39:31.324
(The manly man, JB)

1003
00:39:33.165 --> 00:39:36.705
I thought I would enjoy hunting.

1004
00:39:36.705 --> 00:39:38.464
(The king of fishing, Jong Hyun)

1005
00:39:39.935 --> 00:39:44.004
(The three confident men dream of catching crayfish.)

1006
00:39:45.645 --> 00:39:48.415
(The night sea, here we come.)

1007
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:52.371
Since there are 3 of us, we will at least catch 1 crayfish.

1008
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.940
(Chun Hee, the deity of hunting, confidently dives in first.)

1009
00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.411
(Chun Hee, the deity of hunting, confidently dives in first.)

1010
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:02.750
(The manly man, JB,)

1011
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.750
(and the king of fishing, Jong Hyun, dive in as well.)

1012
00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:11.915
(The night sea, here we come.)

1013
00:40:13.471 --> 00:40:15.871
Since there are 3 of us, we will at least catch 1 crayfish.

1014
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.440
(Chun Hee, the deity of hunting, confidently dives in first.)

1015
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.911
(Chun Hee, the deity of hunting, confidently dives in first.)

1016
00:40:24.141 --> 00:40:26.250
(The manly man, JB,)

1017
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.250
(and the king of fishing, Jong Hyun, dive in as well.)

1018
00:40:29.351 --> 00:40:32.051
(We are going to dominate the night sea of Atiu Island.)

1019
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:37.721
(It's their first time hunting at night. Can they catch fish?)

1020
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.040
(Chun Hee searches the corals first.)

1021
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.301
(Swimming away)

1022
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:55.440
(Hold on. I think something just passed by me.)

1023
00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.311
(He spots his first target.)

1024
00:40:58.281 --> 00:40:59.911
(I am going to catch you by all means!)

1025
00:41:05.991 --> 00:41:07.920
(He aims at it,)

1026
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.721
(but it dashes away.)

1027
00:41:09.721 --> 00:41:14.031
(He uses his bare hand instead of his knife.)

1028
00:41:15.161 --> 00:41:17.101
(His attempt ends in a failure without even touching it.)

1029
00:41:17.101 --> 00:41:20.130
(Hey, guys. We've got ourselves a dummy here!)

1030
00:41:21.201 --> 00:41:23.440
(Gosh, this is infuriating.)

1031
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.511
(He grabs the knife with his right hand and ventures out again.)

1032
00:41:27.511 --> 00:41:30.340
(Is there another fish here?)

1033
00:41:33.081 --> 00:41:34.710
(His second target)

1034
00:41:35.551 --> 00:41:39.351
(It's a perfect chance as the fish can't go up or down to escape.)

1035
00:41:39.491 --> 00:41:42.221
(He aims it with a knife this time.)

1036
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.690
(Swimming away)

1037
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.831
(Wait. Did something just pass by me?)

1038
00:41:48.831 --> 00:41:52.730
(He checks it again as it's hard to believe what just happened.)

1039
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.000
(Darn it!)

1040
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:56.971
Did you see any fish?

1041
00:41:58.741 --> 00:42:00.210
I missed one.

1042
00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.940
All the fish...

1043
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.511
must have swum away after finding out I'm here.

1044
00:42:06.911 --> 00:42:07.980
You didn't see any fish?

1045
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.181
I only saw small ones.

1046
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.920
Then go farther. Try going farther.

1047
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.290
You only swam away for 3m. You can't say that to me.

1048
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:16.320
(Did he take about three steps?)

1049
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.991
<v ->There are no fish here. - Really?</v>

1050
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.130
(I don't have the heart to face you.)

1051
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.331
You can do it.

1052
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:25.630
(So far, Chun Hee hasn't caught anything.)

1053
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.270
(Then what about the manly guy, JB?)

1054
00:42:32.101 --> 00:42:34.741
(He spots a small fish.)

1055
00:42:35.911 --> 00:42:37.340
I just had a feeling...

1056
00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:39.610
that I could do well.

1057
00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:45.081
(He gently approaches it like a butterfly,)

1058
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:46.851
(but it swims away quickly like a bee.)

1059
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:50.090
(He fails.)

1060
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.960
(However, there's no such thing as giving up in my book!)

1061
00:42:56.831 --> 00:42:59.130
(Dashing away)

1062
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.730
(He must be a novice hunter.)

1063
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.570
(Where did it go? Is it still in here?)

1064
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:10.311
(Why is he looking through the gaps after losing the fish?)

1065
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.710
(Chun Hee and JB haven't caught anything so far.)

1066
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:16.551
(Then what about Jong Hyun, the king of fishing?)

1067
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.221
(He's hunting with a scooping net instead of a knife.)

1068
00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:26.290
(These are the fish I usually catch.)

1069
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.301
(He focuses on one area.)

1070
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:37.301
(I got you, punk.)

1071
00:43:37.301 --> 00:43:39.371
(When it's off its guard,)

1072
00:43:39.371 --> 00:43:41.340
(he scoops it up.)

1073
00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.181
(He successfully catches his first fish!)

1074
00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:48.581
(This is the class of the king of fishing,)

1075
00:43:48.581 --> 00:43:49.851
(but then the size of the fish...)

1076
00:43:49.851 --> 00:43:51.420
Why is this so small?

1077
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.750
(They are both from the same sea, but why is his so small?)

1078
00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.491
(My gosh. I can't save my face as the king of fishing.)

1079
00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:06.371
(Meanwhile, JB is still exploring the areas around the coral reefs.)

1080
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.311
(Who are you?)

1081
00:44:17.741 --> 00:44:19.650
(A giant moray eel...)

1082
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:24.051
(passes between JB and Jong Hyun.)

1083
00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.951
(He tries to catch it with a scooping net.)

1084
00:44:30.061 --> 00:44:33.190
(This one is fast!)

1085
00:44:37.301 --> 00:44:39.161
(Did he successfully acquire the fish?)

1086
00:44:39.161 --> 00:44:40.831
(No, he failed.)

1087
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:43.270
(The moray eel hides between the rocks.)

1088
00:44:45.971 --> 00:44:49.011
(There's no way I'm going to lose you!)

1089
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.411
(I'm certain it hid under this rock.)

1090
00:44:56.851 --> 00:45:01.851
(JB puts his hand under it while turning his body around.)

1091
00:45:02.761 --> 00:45:05.090
(Slithering)

1092
00:45:06.161 --> 00:45:09.161
(The moray eel escapes as it avoids JB and Jong Hyun.)

1093
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.500
(The moray eel disappears into the other side of the dark sea.)

1094
00:45:19.141 --> 00:45:20.311
<v ->Did you catch anything? - No.</v>

1095
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.340
<v ->Chun Hee, I saw an eel this big. - Really?</v>

1096
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.281
I tried to catch it.

1097
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:31.181
(Hunting in the sea isn't an easy task.)

1098
00:45:32.991 --> 00:45:35.491
(He looks the glummest.)

1099
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:36.590
Darn it.

1100
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:39.690
What happened?

1101
00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:41.960
<v ->Sorry? - What happened?</v>

1102
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.000
I had fun looking at the sea.

1103
00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:50.871
(Chun Hee returns to the base camp for now to regroup.)

1104
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:53.840
<v ->Did you catch anything? - Chun Hee.</v>

1105
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.040
(They are waiting for him.)

1106
00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.110
Did you catch anything?

1107
00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:57.511
<v ->What? A crayfish? - Sorry?</v>

1108
00:45:57.511 --> 00:45:58.581
<v ->A crayfish? - No.</v>

1109
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:01.951
(I'm sorry. I'm doomed.)

1110
00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:03.020
Seriously.

1111
00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:05.351
It's not easy to approach the fish and stick the knife in.

1112
00:46:05.351 --> 00:46:07.121
<v ->It's not easy. - After hearing that...</v>

1113
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.451
Kang Nam, are you going to go in?

1114
00:46:10.061 --> 00:46:11.090
What should I do?

1115
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:12.991
<v ->If you catch fish tonight, - You have to wash anyway.</v>

1116
00:46:13.161 --> 00:46:14.790
If you catch fish tonight, you'll be a hero.

1117
00:46:14.931 --> 00:46:16.561
I'm sure I'll catch some if I go in.

1118
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:18.900
Jong Hyun and JB will look up to you...

1119
00:46:19.701 --> 00:46:20.770
<v ->if you catch fish. - Pardon?</v>

1120
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.840
Go into the water if you want to show how capable you are.

1121
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.871
My gosh, he's going in.

1122
00:46:25.871 --> 00:46:27.741
(Kang Nam, the capable man, sets out!)

1123
00:46:29.141 --> 00:46:30.181
(The capable man, Kang Nam)

1124
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:31.181
Show them what you've got.

1125
00:46:31.181 --> 00:46:32.540
(The capable man, Kang Nam)

1126
00:46:33.551 --> 00:46:35.511
(With dignified strides,)

1127
00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:38.820
(he heads to the sea.)

1128
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.851
I bet he can catch some.

1129
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:47.090
(Kang Nam, the Vice Chief,)

1130
00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.960
(dives into the water without any hesitation.)

1131
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:56.840
(Will Kang Nam live up to other members' expectations?)

1132
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.311
(Firstly, he heads to where the younger members are.)

1133
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:07.150
(Oh, hey! It's Kang Nam, the Vice Chief.)

1134
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:13.710
(Kang Nam tries to teach JB some hunting skills.)

1135
00:47:13.851 --> 00:47:16.790
(Is there any fish I can hunt?)

1136
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:20.391
(Spotted!)

1137
00:47:20.391 --> 00:47:21.431
(Snapping)

1138
00:47:22.561 --> 00:47:26.070
(He corners it to a gap between the rocks as if he's dribbling it.)

1139
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.040
(He catches the fish at once.)

1140
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:36.940
(He is true to his reputation of the Vice Chief.)

1141
00:47:38.641 --> 00:47:42.920
(After his demonstration, it's time for JB to try.)

1142
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.081
Do it from above. From above.

1143
00:47:46.351 --> 00:47:47.420
Do it now.

1144
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.061
Now.

1145
00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.831
(JB catches it at once with Kang Nam's help.)

1146
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:54.891
Great job.

1147
00:47:56.601 --> 00:47:58.601
(Finally, it's their first catch.)

1148
00:47:58.601 --> 00:48:00.270
But this is too small.

1149
00:48:00.801 --> 00:48:04.141
(Then I'll catch you a bigger one then.)

1150
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:09.641
(He searches inside the corals.)

1151
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:16.851
(What a big catch!)

1152
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.551
(The capable man, the Vice Chief)

1153
00:48:22.621 --> 00:48:26.460
(Is Kang Nam's pupil, JB, hunting for something too?)

1154
00:48:31.161 --> 00:48:34.230
(JB successfully hunts a crab too!)

1155
00:48:35.331 --> 00:48:36.570
Is this edible?

1156
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.570
(JB can catch crabs all by himself now.)

1157
00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:39.670
Yes, it is.

1158
00:48:45.681 --> 00:48:50.051
(Kang Nam wants to catch a bigger fish.)

1159
00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:54.090
(After exploring for a long time,)

1160
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.420
(Kang Nam stops at some place.)

1161
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:02.590
(He spots a giant fish.)

1162
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:06.270
(Yes! I got you, punk!)

1163
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.301
(It's caught between rocks. It has nowhere to go.)

1164
00:49:12.141 --> 00:49:14.170
(Oh, my. Did you get another one?)

1165
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:17.581
(He aims it carefully...)

1166
00:49:17.581 --> 00:49:19.110
(and lunges towards it.)

1167
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.790
(What is this?)

1168
00:49:26.851 --> 00:49:30.360
(He went after a fish, but why does he have a crayfish?)

1169
00:49:30.391 --> 00:49:32.690
(What just happened?)

1170
00:49:33.531 --> 00:49:37.130
(He definitely targeted the fish and went for it,)

1171
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:41.570
(but a crayfish next to the fish got scared at the sound and came out.)

1172
00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:45.471
(And it fell right into Kang Nam's hands.)

1173
00:49:46.641 --> 00:49:50.181
(Even from another angle,)

1174
00:49:50.181 --> 00:49:51.940
(he did thrust the knife,)

1175
00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.940
(but he ended up with a crayfish all of a sudden.)

1176
00:49:57.621 --> 00:50:01.820
(Even Kang Nam shakes his body as he's surprised.)

1177
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:06.920
(Why do I have a crayfish in my hands?)

1178
00:50:11.931 --> 00:50:12.931
I can't believe this.

1179
00:50:14.301 --> 00:50:15.331
He got it!

1180
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.241
<v ->I can't believe this. - What do you mean?</v>

1181
00:50:18.241 --> 00:50:21.210
I saw a big fish, so I tried to catch it with my knife, but...

1182
00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:23.081
It got scared and came out from the side.

1183
00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.540
(This is embarrassing.)

1184
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.150
It literally came into my hand.

1185
00:50:26.451 --> 00:50:27.781
That didn't look cool at all.

1186
00:50:28.951 --> 00:50:30.181
Not cool at all.

1187
00:50:31.081 --> 00:50:32.181
It didn't look cook.

1188
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:33.351
(He feels wronged.)

1189
00:50:33.351 --> 00:50:34.351
I'm serious.

1190
00:50:34.451 --> 00:50:36.090
The crayfish was next to the fish.

1191
00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.761
When I stuck my knife, it got scared, came out from the side,

1192
00:50:39.491 --> 00:50:41.931
and came into my left hand just like that.

1193
00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:43.031
(This is unprecedented.)

1194
00:50:43.031 --> 00:50:46.170
It would've been cool if I struggled to catch it after discovering it,

1195
00:50:46.801 --> 00:50:49.000
but I caught the crayfish like a duck takes to water.

1196
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:50.940
That's how I caught it, so I didn't look cool at all,

1197
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.971
but I'm glad that I caught one.

1198
00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:55.980
(It's awesome that Kang Nam caught a crayfish though!)

1199
00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.741
Anyway, let me put this in it.

1200
00:50:57.741 --> 00:50:59.311
(Luck is part of one's skill set too.)

1201
00:51:01.181 --> 00:51:02.880
<v ->Look at all the corners. - It's small.</v>

1202
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.781
<v ->Sorry? - It's small.</v>

1203
00:51:04.781 --> 00:51:05.781
It's still good though.

1204
00:51:05.851 --> 00:51:10.790
(The manly pair, Kang Nam and JB caught a crayfish and a fish.)

1205
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.090
The first one I spotted was bigger than this fish.

1206
00:51:15.491 --> 00:51:16.860
It's cold. I can no longer stay here.

1207
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.431
(They return to the base camp after catching the crayfish.)

1208
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.270
Did you catch it?

1209
00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:23.940
That's incredible.

1210
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.471
How did you catch it?

1211
00:51:25.801 --> 00:51:26.871
(Could that...)

1212
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.011
(be...)

1213
00:51:29.011 --> 00:51:30.641
(a crayfish?)

1214
00:51:30.641 --> 00:51:31.781
<v ->We caught these. - Who caught that?</v>

1215
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.051
<v ->Kang Nam did. - Really?</v>

1216
00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:34.681
He was trying to catch a fish,

1217
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.820
but this got scared and came out of the gap.

1218
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.380
(No way. I didn't see any earlier.)

1219
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.491
<v ->He caught it. - Good work.</v>

1220
00:51:41.491 --> 00:51:42.551
But it's freezing cold.

1221
00:51:42.551 --> 00:51:45.391
(Their night hunting is over, and it's time for them to sleep.)

1222
00:51:45.391 --> 00:51:47.460
<v ->Sorry? - I knew Kang Nam was good.</v>

1223
00:51:48.991 --> 00:51:51.161
They made another memory while...

1224
00:51:51.261 --> 00:51:53.471
they hunted for a crayfish in the sea at night.

1225
00:51:53.471 --> 00:51:56.101
(The night in Atiu Island etches a memory in their hearts.)

1226
00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.801
(And...)

1227
00:51:58.801 --> 00:52:00.241
(the sun rises again as always.)

1228
00:52:00.241 --> 00:52:02.511
The pitch-black darkness begins to fade away,

1229
00:52:02.681 --> 00:52:04.340
and it's a new day.

1230
00:52:05.311 --> 00:52:07.681
What kind of adventures will unfold today?

1231
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:11.520
(The Tribe will face...)

1232
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.051
(a giant footprint of a deity.)

1233
00:52:16.621 --> 00:52:20.061
(When they daringly throw themselves into the wonders...)

1234
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:24.931
(The sea reminds them again that a new world exists.)

1235
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:27.531
(The Pacific Ocean gives the Tribe...)

1236
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:30.270
(another present!)

1237
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.940
(Did you see the whale?)

1238
00:52:34.141 --> 00:52:37.311
(The whale shows up in front of the Tribe...)

1239
00:52:37.311 --> 00:52:40.551
(as if it's greeting them.)

1240
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:43.681
(The biggest mammal in the world)

1241
00:52:43.681 --> 00:52:48.420
(It's a miraculous moment the whale presents them.)

1242
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:54.590
(The Tribe is sound asleep without knowing what lies ahead of them.)

1243
00:52:58.601 --> 00:53:01.801
(Wait, someone has woken up?)

1244
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.811
(Chun Hee is the 1st one to wake up.)

1245
00:53:06.811 --> 00:53:11.040
(Chun Hee keeps the fire burning in case the others get cold.)

1246
00:53:13.311 --> 00:53:17.221
(He takes out the crayfish they caught last night.)

1247
00:53:17.221 --> 00:53:18.781
(He goes to the sea with big strides.)

1248
00:53:20.551 --> 00:53:21.991
Is that the one you guys caught yesterday?

1249
00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:23.460
Yes, Kang Nam caught it last night.

1250
00:53:26.391 --> 00:53:27.391
Kang Nam caught this.

1251
00:53:28.031 --> 00:53:29.161
He caught two.

1252
00:53:32.261 --> 00:53:33.331
What will you do?

1253
00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:36.371
I want to cook soup with the crayfish and the crab.

1254
00:53:36.371 --> 00:53:40.940
(Today's menu is morning seafood soup with crayfish and crab.)

1255
00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:48.011
(He puts the crayfish and crab he washed into the canteen.)

1256
00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:51.851
(He cuts chili peppers to add a spicy flavor into the soup.)

1257
00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:00.491
(His last step is to close the lid tightly and boil the soup.)

1258
00:54:03.431 --> 00:54:06.570
(It was a shame he couldn't caught one,)

1259
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:11.471
(but he wants to feed them delicious food which is endearing.)

1260
00:54:13.911 --> 00:54:14.911
What are you doing, Chun Hee?

1261
00:54:18.081 --> 00:54:19.110
I'm cooking breakfast.

1262
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:20.911
Did you already clean them?

1263
00:54:21.411 --> 00:54:24.951
I didn't cook the fish. I'm only cooking the crayfish and the crab.

1264
00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:26.721
I'm cooking them together.

1265
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.590
I should go help...

1266
00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:31.290
before others wake up.

1267
00:54:32.891 --> 00:54:34.730
(The Chief is already up too.)

1268
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:35.891
Are you cooking breakfast?

1269
00:54:35.891 --> 00:54:39.531
(That's the crayfish.)

1270
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.801
(The members of the Tribe wake up 1 by 1 and see the morning sun.)

1271
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:51.610
(A delicious smell begins to waft.)

1272
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.581
(It's time for breakfast.)

1273
00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:56.250
Yesterday, Kang Nam caught a crayfish, a crab,

1274
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:57.820
and a lot of other stuff.

1275
00:54:58.051 --> 00:54:59.281
<v ->Did he go in there? - We can't eat the fish.</v>

1276
00:54:59.951 --> 00:55:02.320
We forgot to salt it, so I only cooked the crayfish, crab,

1277
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.360
<v ->I see. - and the conches from yesterday.</v>

1278
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:05.590
<v ->So what is it? - It's seafood soup.</v>

1279
00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.460
Soup?

1280
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:10.000
<v ->That looks good. - Yes, that does look delicious.</v>

1281
00:55:10.661 --> 00:55:11.730
(It does look appetizing.)

1282
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.770
I put eight chili peppers that you like.

1283
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.601
<v ->8 chili peppers. - I put 8 chili peppers in it.</v>

1284
00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:18.900
<v ->Kang Nam caught all these? - What is that?</v>

1285
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.040
<v ->Kang Nam. - Yes?</v>

1286
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.511
Now that you go hunting,

1287
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.340
<v ->my life got so much easier. - My gosh.</v>

1288
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.210
Yesterday, Kang Nam...

1289
00:55:26.811 --> 00:55:30.920
(It's plump and has the sauce made of its innards.)

1290
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.920
<v ->Gosh, someone has... - Se Ri.</v>

1291
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.951
<v ->to take a bite first. - Can I eat first?</v>

1292
00:55:33.951 --> 00:55:34.951
Try it.

1293
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:36.161
<v ->Chief, have the first bite. - No, no.</v>

1294
00:55:36.221 --> 00:55:37.661
<v ->You should eat first. - He shouldn't eat it now.</v>

1295
00:55:37.661 --> 00:55:39.360
(Se Ri and the Chief offer it to each other.)

1296
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.690
That part is where the innards are in.

1297
00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:43.900
<v ->Are these the eggs? - That's the tastiest part. Gosh.</v>

1298
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
I'm going to eat it now.

1299
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:48.931
<v ->What a fancy breakfast. - My goodness.</v>

1300
00:55:49.301 --> 00:55:52.201
<v ->I'm happy to see a smiling face. - Gosh.</v>

1301
00:55:52.201 --> 00:55:54.641
(It was tasty for dinner. It's better in the morning.)

1302
00:55:54.641 --> 00:55:56.741
<v ->It's really good. - Hey, eat up.</v>

1303
00:55:56.811 --> 00:55:59.551
<v ->How can it be our staple food? - I know, right?</v>

1304
00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:01.650
If we eat more than twice, it becomes our staple food.

1305
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.621
<v ->It's my first time eating it. - Stop lying.</v>

1306
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.681
You're good at that. You keep doing it.

1307
00:56:05.951 --> 00:56:08.051
<v ->Eating meat is my wish now. - This is delicious.</v>

1308
00:56:09.561 --> 00:56:12.730
You don't get to have three meals a day in the jungle often, right?

1309
00:56:13.491 --> 00:56:15.590
<v ->We've never eaten this much. - Right.</v>

1310
00:56:16.661 --> 00:56:19.301
<v ->Really? - We never ate crayfish twice.</v>

1311
00:56:19.301 --> 00:56:20.400
Right, it never happened.

1312
00:56:20.471 --> 00:56:21.831
We usually ate a meal a day.

1313
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:23.741
Usually, that was the case.

1314
00:56:24.301 --> 00:56:26.110
But there were times we had two meals a day,

1315
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:27.170
but never like this.

1316
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:29.811
(This is the first time eating three luxurious meals a day.)

1317
00:56:30.781 --> 00:56:32.540
(The crab shows up after the crayfish.)

1318
00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.710
Is the crab tasty?

1319
00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.380
Right, split open the shell.

1320
00:56:36.051 --> 00:56:38.051
<v ->I see innards. - I see crab roe too.</v>

1321
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:39.690
<v ->Look at the innards. - JB.</v>

1322
00:56:39.951 --> 00:56:41.121
<v ->Try it. - When you hold it...</v>

1323
00:56:41.121 --> 00:56:42.250
<v ->JB. - The sauce.</v>

1324
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:44.221
(Slurping)

1325
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:48.690
Is it good?

1326
00:56:49.261 --> 00:56:50.261
<v ->That one is... - Hold on.</v>

1327
00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:52.630
(He tastes it again as the taste is unbelievable.)

1328
00:56:52.971 --> 00:56:54.070
You must taste this.

1329
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.971
(Is this really the crab that I caught?)

1330
00:56:57.101 --> 00:56:59.440
(The flavor of the innards fill their mouths.)

1331
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.710
I think eight chili peppers are good enough.

1332
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:04.741
<v ->Isn't it good? - Our breakfast is amazing. Gosh.</v>

1333
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.781
<v ->This is the best. - This soup has...</v>

1334
00:57:07.551 --> 00:57:09.781
<v ->the crab, crayfish, and... - Se Ri, try the soup.</v>

1335
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.250
<v ->This is great. - It's really good.</v>

1336
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:12.891
<v ->I love the soup. It warms my body. - I see roe in there.</v>

1337
00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.020
My gosh.

1338
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.221
(The harmony of the innards and the seafood soup)

1339
00:57:19.221 --> 00:57:20.230
The conch.

1340
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:23.701
Okay. You should have some too.

1341
00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:25.061
<v ->I had some. I did. - Gosh, it's hot.</v>

1342
00:57:25.061 --> 00:57:26.230
<v ->Eat some. - You should eat.</v>

1343
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.201
(Se Ri, you should eat.)

1344
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.801
<v ->This is really delicious. - Isn't it good?</v>

1345
00:57:32.641 --> 00:57:34.141
<v ->Hey, try it. - Gosh.</v>

1346
00:57:34.141 --> 00:57:35.641
<v ->Now that I had some soup... - You didn't say no.</v>

1347
00:57:35.641 --> 00:57:36.980
(She offers it to Jong Hyun.)

1348
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.210
It reminds me of pork belly meat I had in Seoul before the shoot.

1349
00:57:40.311 --> 00:57:41.750
I want to eat pork belly meat too.

1350
00:57:42.351 --> 00:57:44.221
<v ->The crab leg. - This is like the spicy crab stew.</v>

1351
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:46.391
<v ->It's good. - It is, isn't it?</v>

1352
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:51.460
So he cooked the soup with the whole crab.

1353
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.431
(The Chief pours the leftover soup to Se Ri.)

1354
00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:58.360
<v ->Look at the color. - Kang Nam, you should go there.</v>

1355
00:57:58.801 --> 00:58:00.371
<v ->That looks hot. - It must be hot.</v>

1356
00:58:00.831 --> 00:58:01.871
I'm all right.

1357
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:05.101
<v ->I poured her too much. - It was too hot to eat it.</v>

1358
00:58:05.101 --> 00:58:06.170
(My gosh, it's burning hot.)

1359
00:58:06.741 --> 00:58:08.340
Hold on. I poured too much.

1360
00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.011
Was it too hot? Is that why you gave it to the Chief? To his bare hands?

1361
00:58:11.011 --> 00:58:12.480
(Is that why she gave it to him?)

1362
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.681
(My gosh!)

1363
00:58:15.351 --> 00:58:17.051
(I wasn't thinking.)

1364
00:58:17.051 --> 00:58:20.790
<v ->Both of you don't have gloves on. - No, I thought he had gloves on.</v>

1365
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:21.920
<v ->Don't hold it over 10 seconds. - It was hot.</v>

1366
00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.020
She thought he could handle it.

1367
00:58:27.991 --> 00:58:29.601
(The broth is richer with the crab innards.)

1368
00:58:29.601 --> 00:58:31.630
<v ->It's even better with innards. - It is.</v>

1369
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:34.871
<v ->You must smack your forehead. - My gosh.</v>

1370
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000
This is...

1371
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:38.670
<v ->Isn't it incredible? - It's perfect for hangover.</v>

1372
00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:39.770
<v ->It's perfect for breakfast. - My gosh.</v>

1373
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:41.210
(What?)

1374
00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.540
(He's drinking the soup.)

1375
00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.540
Are you eating poisonous tonic?

1376
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.880
(Gosh, warm soup in the jungle...)

1377
00:58:47.911 --> 00:58:50.480
My body did warm up after having some soup.

1378
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.081
It was really cold yesterday.

1379
00:58:52.351 --> 00:58:53.790
<v ->Wasn't it really windy last night? - I know.</v>

1380
00:58:53.851 --> 00:58:56.621
Yesterday, on our way... Wait.

1381
00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:58.790
<v ->We couldn't find this, right? - No.</v>

1382
00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:00.190
No. They are the last two flags.

1383
00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:03.000
You must remember where you found this though, right?

1384
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Yes, I do.

1385
00:59:04.201 --> 00:59:06.000
From this point,

1386
00:59:06.531 --> 00:59:09.340
<v ->we can follow the coastline. - Okay.</v>

1387
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.801
<v ->It will be only about 1km. - Okay.</v>

1388
00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.170
<v ->I got it. - Okay.</v>

1389
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.170
<v ->Let's head out. - Let's get going.</v>

1390
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:17.511
<v ->Let's go. - Be careful. Don't get hurt.</v>

1391
00:59:17.581 --> 00:59:19.141
<v ->Good luck. - Let's get going.</v>

1392
00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:24.480
To find last two flags, they set out to the eastern part of the sea...

1393
00:59:24.721 --> 00:59:26.250
on the other side of the base camp.

1394
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:27.451
Watch your head.

1395
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:30.190
<v ->Shall we go down? - Let's go down.</v>

1396
00:59:30.661 --> 00:59:31.690
Be careful.

1397
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:36.101
<v ->Let's go down. - I see. That's how it looks.</v>

1398
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:38.531
<v ->JB, hold this for me. - Wait.</v>

1399
00:59:38.531 --> 00:59:39.730
<v ->This is dangerous. - JB.</v>

1400
00:59:39.971 --> 00:59:42.170
<v ->Can you hold this? - Let him come down first.</v>

1401
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:43.400
(He's the expert in exploring for flags.)

1402
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400
Jump down carefully.

1403
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.670
(He easily jumps down.)

1404
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:48.070
Jump.

1405
00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:49.840
(On the other hand, he seems inexperienced.)

1406
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.281
<v ->On the side... - I can do it.</v>

1407
00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:53.110
Be careful.

1408
00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:54.150
(Sol Bin bravely comes down.)

1409
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:55.511
Don't jump. Don't jump from there.

1410
00:59:55.511 --> 00:59:56.581
Come down a bit more, and jump.

1411
00:59:58.851 --> 00:59:59.951
I did it.

1412
00:59:59.951 --> 01:00:00.991
Jumping down is faster.

1413
01:00:00.991 --> 01:00:02.661
(Everyone successfully descends the hill.)

1414
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:03.690
All right.

1415
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.331
I think it's this way.

1416
01:00:06.331 --> 01:00:07.630
(They begin their exploration of the seashore.)

1417
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.090
<v ->Let's look for the flags. - I don't see them here.</v>

1418
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:11.661
Where are they?

1419
01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:13.070
(The flags must be somewhere near the seashore.)

1420
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:14.170
They are not here either.

1421
01:00:16.471 --> 01:00:18.801
My gosh. The view is just ravishing.

1422
01:00:20.811 --> 01:00:24.181
(The primitive nature unfolds in front their eyes.)

1423
01:00:24.181 --> 01:00:25.181
(They forget about the flag...)

1424
01:00:25.181 --> 01:00:26.210
I feel like I'll get sucked in.

1425
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.451
(and appreciate the nature for a minute.)

1426
01:00:30.451 --> 01:00:31.520
It's pretty.

1427
01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.581
(Created by wind, waves, and time)

1428
01:00:32.581 --> 01:00:33.951
<v ->Gosh. - Goodness.</v>

1429
01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.161
It's really pretty.

1430
01:00:36.161 --> 01:00:38.790
(The landscapes of Cook Islands)

1431
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:39.831
It's really pretty.

1432
01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:41.491
Wait.

1433
01:00:41.991 --> 01:00:43.960
<v ->Isn't this a sea urchin? - Where?</v>

1434
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:46.730
<v ->Here. - Yes.</v>

1435
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:47.931
There's a sea urchin.

1436
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.701
It's huge.

1437
01:00:50.701 --> 01:00:52.371
(He picks up a big conch.)

1438
01:00:52.371 --> 01:00:53.741
Look.

1439
01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:56.710
There are many of them.

1440
01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.980
<v ->Do fish eat this? - It must be delicious.</v>

1441
01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.311
There's sea urchin roe.

1442
01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:01.811
<v ->It's a starfish. - A starfish.</v>

1443
01:01:01.811 --> 01:01:02.820
It's cute.

1444
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:04.581
You can use it as a hairpin.

1445
01:01:05.581 --> 01:01:06.750
Water's coming in.

1446
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.790
(Everyone is busy sightseeing.)

1447
01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:12.621
Look. It's beer foam.

1448
01:01:12.931 --> 01:01:14.061
Isn't there anything to eat?

1449
01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:15.190
(I want cold beer.)

1450
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.670
(We saw a lot of things, but there's nothing to eat.)

1451
01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:22.840
Crab. It's a big crab.

1452
01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.101
(Kang Nam spots stone crabs.)

1453
01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:25.170
There are a lot of them.

1454
01:01:26.511 --> 01:01:28.371
(Jong Hyun approaches them.)

1455
01:01:28.371 --> 01:01:30.641
But you can't eat those.

1456
01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.951
Cute.

1457
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.051
Run away.

1458
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.281
(Both the flag and food are hard to find.)

1459
01:01:39.281 --> 01:01:40.351
There's a blow fish.

1460
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.221
Gosh, it's big.

1461
01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.020
It's big.

1462
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:46.931
It's a blow fish.

1463
01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:49.360
<v ->Be careful. - It's a blow fish.</v>

1464
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960
Blow fish.

1465
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:54.831
(He starts dribbling the blow fish.)

1466
01:01:55.601 --> 01:01:56.670
(Carefully)

1467
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.241
<v ->It's angry. - Awesome.</v>

1468
01:01:58.241 --> 01:02:00.971
<v ->I got it. - Awesome.</v>

1469
01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:02.781
<v ->It's a blow fish. - It's cute.</v>

1470
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.480
<v ->It's angry. - It's cute.</v>

1471
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.710
(Kang Nam picks it up so easily.)

1472
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.781
(The blow fish is angry.)

1473
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.020
(It's cute, but...)

1474
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.221
<v ->Can we eat it? - You'll die if you do.</v>

1475
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.460
Bye.

1476
01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.561
(Kang Nam lets it go.)

1477
01:02:21.491 --> 01:02:22.561
It's gotten bigger.

1478
01:02:23.661 --> 01:02:24.761
There.

1479
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.601
(Spitting out water)

1480
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:29.440
<v ->It's cute. - It's cute.</v>

1481
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.440
(It looks familiar somehow.)

1482
01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:36.610
(After hearing a shocking birth secret,)

1483
01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:39.210
(he spits out the orange juice.)

1484
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.880
(Spilling)

1485
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.020
There.

1486
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.250
(I can't believe she's Sun Jung's daughter!)

1487
01:02:46.551 --> 01:02:47.621
Chubby.

1488
01:02:47.621 --> 01:02:50.590
(The birth secret must've been shocking to the blow fish too.)

1489
01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:51.721
Chubby.

1490
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.761
It's spitting water out.

1491
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:56.831
Bye.

1492
01:02:56.831 --> 01:02:57.931
(The blow fish is released.)

1493
01:02:58.701 --> 01:02:59.900
<v ->Let's go. - Let's go.</v>

1494
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:03.340
<v ->We'll die if we eat a blow fish. - It's cute.</v>

1495
01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.741
(Blow fish shouldn't be consumed because it's poisonous.)

1496
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:09.311
Wait. Isn't that a cave?

1497
01:03:09.311 --> 01:03:10.480
Isn't it?

1498
01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:12.281
<v ->It is. - The flag might be in there.</v>

1499
01:03:12.851 --> 01:03:14.051
Shall we go in?

1500
01:03:15.281 --> 01:03:16.551
There's water in there.

1501
01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:17.581
(They go inside feeling excited.)

1502
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.020
<v ->Fish. - There's fish.</v>

1503
01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.261
I see some fish.

1504
01:03:23.261 --> 01:03:24.320
(Kang Nam checks it out.)

1505
01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.960
There's nothing.

1506
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.290
Is there a way in?

1507
01:03:31.301 --> 01:03:32.360
No.

1508
01:03:32.831 --> 01:03:34.070
Is there a way to climb up?

1509
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.301
No.

1510
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.440
There's nothing.

1511
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.641
(While the others examine the cave,)

1512
01:03:40.641 --> 01:03:41.710
I thought there'd be something.

1513
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:42.940
(Kang Nam searches in between the rocks.)

1514
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.451
(He searches every nook and cranny.)

1515
01:03:47.451 --> 01:03:48.511
The flag isn't here, is it?

1516
01:03:48.581 --> 01:03:49.750
<v ->No. - No, it's not.</v>

1517
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:52.351
<v ->Let's go. - We thought it'd be in there.</v>

1518
01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:56.391
Isn't it over there? Shouldn't we go to that end?

1519
01:03:57.221 --> 01:03:59.730
Let's stay here and prepare it.

1520
01:04:00.261 --> 01:04:03.400
Please look at my club. I tried carving one.

1521
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.871
Did you make a wood or an iron?

1522
01:04:06.871 --> 01:04:08.000
(Did he carve a golf club?)

1523
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.241
It's a wood, but it has the angle of an iron.

1524
01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.070
(One day ago in the survival zone)

1525
01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:16.681
(Chief Byung Man carves a golf club for Se Ri.)

1526
01:04:20.451 --> 01:04:23.150
(He ends up making one for a left-handed person.)

1527
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:29.250
(After carving and trimming for a while,)

1528
01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.190
(he finally completes a golf club.)

1529
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.900
(He doesn't forget about durability.)

1530
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.500
(He makes a hybrid golf club for Se Ri.)

1531
01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:43.871
(This golf club gets used later.)

1532
01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.270
(The final mission to receive the only clue)

1533
01:04:49.311 --> 01:04:52.141
(The queen of golf Se Ri steps up.)

1534
01:04:56.351 --> 01:05:01.351
(She swings.)

1535
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:09.290
(The suspenseful final mission)

1536
01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:11.601
(What will be the result?)

1537
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:14.471
The thickest one is the latest finding.

1538
01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:16.940
<v ->Really? - Yes. There are whales.</v>

1539
01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:19.101
<v ->The camera is under repair. - Record it.</v>

1540
01:05:19.101 --> 01:05:20.570
(Only the fixed camera is filming.)

1541
01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:22.340
(Whales stay on Cook Islands during breeding season.)

1542
01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.840
They came up!

1543
01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.210
<v ->The whales came up! - There.</v>

1544
01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.051
<v ->Se Ri. - Did you see the whale?</v>

1545
01:05:31.051 --> 01:05:32.790
Let's go down.

1546
01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:35.991
<v ->Amazing. - They came up.</v>

1547
01:05:35.991 --> 01:05:37.061
(The filming resumes.)

1548
01:05:43.561 --> 01:05:44.661
Amazing.

1549
01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:48.031
Over there!

1550
01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:50.741
(Everyone is surprised and shaken.)

1551
01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:52.170
Over there!

1552
01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:55.141
(You can see a whale's silhouette.)

1553
01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.610
(The closer they get, the more they get excited.)

1554
01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.081
Amazing.

1555
01:06:04.081 --> 01:06:09.081
(The whale is so close, you can see it from the shore.)

1556
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:11.520
(Gosh!)

1557
01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:15.491
(He's so happy to see it.)

1558
01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:17.000
It waved at me.

1559
01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.570
(The whale welcomes the Tribe.)

1560
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.630
Look.

1561
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.770
<v ->There must be 2 of them. - There are 2.</v>

1562
01:06:28.371 --> 01:06:32.440
(Two whales swim side by side.)

1563
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.551
There are two whales.

1564
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.621
(The Tribe is watching them right before in front of it.)

1565
01:06:40.221 --> 01:06:44.391
(The stationed camera films the whales approaching.)

1566
01:06:46.261 --> 01:06:48.261
They could be a mom and a baby.

1567
01:06:48.261 --> 01:06:51.230
<v ->It's possible. - They could be.</v>

1568
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.801
There are two of them.

1569
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:56.840
(The big one raises its fin, and the small one follows.)

1570
01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:00.740
(It's as if the baby is learning from its mom.)

1571
01:07:01.971 --> 01:07:04.780
<v ->It's really cool. - I can't believe this.</v>

1572
01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:07.651
(The baby whale will grow under its mother's care.)

1573
01:07:07.651 --> 01:07:09.780
<v ->The one in the back is smaller. - Yes.</v>

1574
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.021
(It's an amazing sight.)

1575
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.990
<v ->It's a whale, not a dolphin. - Exactly.</v>

1576
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.861
You can see dolphins,

1577
01:07:20.361 --> 01:07:21.561
but not whales.

1578
01:07:21.891 --> 01:07:23.561
I can't believe I'm looking at whales.

1579
01:07:24.931 --> 01:07:26.330
(Right then)

1580
01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:27.700
(A huge tail comes above water.)

1581
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.340
<v ->Over there! - Is it a tail?</v>

1582
01:07:31.401 --> 01:07:34.240
<v ->It's huge. - Can you imagine how big it is?</v>

1583
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.941
(A small movement of its tale makes huge waves.)

1584
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.311
Whales are hard to see, right?

1585
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:39.380
<v ->Yes. - Amazing.</v>

1586
01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.481
I've only seen them three times in total.

1587
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:47.490
Chief Byung Man has been doing this show for seven years,

1588
01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:49.021
but he didn't get to see whales often.

1589
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:54.420
(A free living organism in the ocean)

1590
01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:06.710
We've only seen it from afar on a boat.

1591
01:08:07.141 --> 01:08:09.710
I can't believe we're seeing it so close by the shore.

1592
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:11.011
This is really interesting.

1593
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.811
(Humpback whales spends breeding season in Cook Islands,)

1594
01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:15.511
(and moves to the Antarctic Ocean.)

1595
01:08:15.511 --> 01:08:17.920
(They don't usually swim in pairs,)

1596
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.120
(but mothers and babies spend the early days together.)

1597
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.391
You can tell that it's huge.

1598
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:25.290
It grows as big as 16m,

1599
01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:28.660
and as heavy as 30 tons. It's a humpback whale.

1600
01:08:34.231 --> 01:08:36.200
They come up above the water...

1601
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.941
to breathe.

1602
01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:43.710
Like us,

1603
01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:46.181
they take a deep breath outside the water,

1604
01:08:46.181 --> 01:08:49.111
and hold their breath when they dive in.

1605
01:08:50.821 --> 01:08:52.750
(They are docile and nice.)

1606
01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:57.120
(They're "angels of the sea" that swim like people.)

1607
01:09:04.361 --> 01:09:07.601
Hitting the surface of the water...

1608
01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:11.771
with its tails is a way of expressing its feelings.

1609
01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.311
Then don't you think...

1610
01:09:15.311 --> 01:09:18.740
its saying hello to Byung Man's Tribe?

1611
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.051
(What is it trying to say?)

1612
01:09:22.981 --> 01:09:25.481
I think it's because the depth is shallow.

1613
01:09:26.551 --> 01:09:27.651
On the land...

1614
01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:28.920
<v ->Gosh. - Look.</v>

1615
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.920
<v ->Look at its tail. - Isn't it chasing after fish?</v>

1616
01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:33.330
<v ->Is it eating fish? - Yes.</v>

1617
01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:35.460
<v ->Hunting? - Yes.</v>

1618
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.061
It eats a lot at a time.

1619
01:09:37.061 --> 01:09:38.431
(Watching the whales,)

1620
01:09:38.431 --> 01:09:41.571
(the Chief is happy like a kid.)

1621
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:44.601
It'd be nice to fish like them.

1622
01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:48.370
I heard you saw whales. Did you see them?

1623
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.141
A staff...

1624
01:09:51.141 --> 01:09:53.210
first spotted them from afar.

1625
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:56.821
I've seen them from afar.

1626
01:09:57.521 --> 01:09:59.790
But I've never seen one so close from the shore.

1627
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:03.120
It raised its fin up in the air.

1628
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.620
(An unforgettable greeting)

1629
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.761
It did that.

1630
01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:08.361
Then its tail came out.

1631
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:11.061
I was just staring.

1632
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:15.030
For the first time in my life,

1633
01:10:15.901 --> 01:10:17.540
I saw a whale dance.

1634
01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:20.240
At the horizon,

1635
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.740
A whale came up the surface.

1636
01:10:22.811 --> 01:10:24.011
After that, the water spurted.

1637
01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:25.011
(Gushing out)

1638
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:26.151
The fin went like this too.

1639
01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.611
The tail came up too. The water was...

1640
01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:29.651
(Flipping)

1641
01:10:30.481 --> 01:10:32.120
<v ->It came up! It's up! - My gosh.</v>

1642
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.450
("Humpback whales are the most gamesome and lighthearted of...")

1643
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:38.960
("all whales, making more gay foam and white water than any other.")

1644
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.660
(From "Moby-Dick" Herman Melville)

1645
01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:43.801
Actually, this was my first time seeing a whale.

1646
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.071
I mean, in aquariums,

1647
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.401
the whales aren't as big as that.

1648
01:10:48.731 --> 01:10:50.901
I only saw whales in videos.

1649
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:54.370
What I thought was that it was only possible to see them...

1650
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.840
in Cook Islands, nowhere else.

1651
01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:58.340
It was truly wonderful.

1652
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:00.111
It was wonderful indeed.

1653
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:03.021
My gosh, my jaw dropped right away.

1654
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.721
I've never seen that before. It was my first time.

1655
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.721
It came out of nowhere. It was as if it was saying hello to us.

1656
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.361
It was waving its fin to us.

1657
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:12.761
It was incredible.

1658
01:11:13.861 --> 01:11:15.460
<v ->Wasn't it incredible? - It was a beautiful sight.</v>

1659
01:11:15.861 --> 01:11:17.160
It was so picturesque.

1660
01:11:18.561 --> 01:11:19.571
(It was unreal.)

1661
01:11:19.571 --> 01:11:21.030
It's eating something.

1662
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:23.071
(The movements of the humpback whale seems surreal.)

1663
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.540
<v ->We got to see a whale. - I've never seen this before.</v>

1664
01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:29.311
This survival is a complete package.

1665
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:33.511
It's hard to survive in the jungle as things are unpredictable.

1666
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:36.681
However, these moments of luck at unexpected times...

1667
01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.051
help them continue their exhausting survival.

1668
01:11:40.521 --> 01:11:41.521
It's saying, "I got it."

1669
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:44.990
The survival in Cook Islands gave them unforgettable memories.

1670
01:11:45.561 --> 01:11:48.061
And the adventure will continue!

1671
01:11:48.061 --> 01:11:50.101
(The adventure will continue!)

1672
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.301
Next week.

1673

(The wild jungle treasures the beauty of the world at dawn.)

1674

01:12:05.511 --> 01:12:06.910
That never crossed my mind.
