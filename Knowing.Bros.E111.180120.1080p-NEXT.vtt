2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.929
(Quiet yet vicious winter wind)

3
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.851
(The quiet before the storm here)

4
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:18.872
Jang-hoon!

5
00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:21.810
(Hug)

6
00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:25.971
(Grabbing him by the neck)

7
00:00:26.863 --> 00:00:29.356
(Hugs him and starts to bawl)

8
00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:32.294
(See any difference from the
opening from Episode 105?)

9
00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.450
This is no time for us
to laugh and chatter!

10
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:37.411
(What is it this time?)

11
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.466
(A choke move)

12
00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:44.942
(Jang-hoon gets hit with the same pattern)

13
00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:48.630
I'm amazed he can take down Jang-hoon!

14
00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:50.403
It feels like

15
00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:52.568
I just met a bear on a mountain.

16
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.708
It's no time for us to chatter!

17
00:00:57.154 --> 00:00:59.591
- I couldn't move at all.
- Jang-hoon's in trouble!

18
00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.653
Sang-min, come on in.

19
00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:04.974
What's that?

20
00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:07.317
Something huge has happened to Jang-hoon.

21
00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.263
Mr. Seo Jang-hoon, please read
accurately what I'm pointing.

22
00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:13.239
It's a serious matter.

23
00:01:13.264 --> 00:01:14.864
What is that?

24
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.911
(Eyesight test chart)

25
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:22.255
Top.

26
00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.114
"Sa-wi?" [Sounds like "son-in-law"]

27
00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:27.747
Four...

28
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:30.755
Upward.

29
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.911
(Going well so far)

30
00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:39.177
See? He can't see that far!

31
00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:41.224
Look, everyone!

32
00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.013
He got 1.5 out of 2.0 just last year.

33
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.036
But his eyesight's gotten worse due
to old age, and he's in high school!

34
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:49.849
You know how we went out to eat last time?

35
00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:52.943
He couldn't read the
numbers on the receipt!

36
00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:54.981
(Now he remembers)

37
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.825
It was so shocking.

38
00:01:56.864 --> 00:01:58.591
We went to go eat chicken last time.

39
00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:01.950
He went to go pay for it, but
he kept staring at the receipt.

40
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:03.872
I said, "What's wrong?"

41
00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.176
He said, "Isn't $1,350 too
much for eating chicken?"

42
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.708
I said, "What? That's ridiculous!"

43
00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:14.919
And I looked, and there was a receipt
for 350 dollars, and another for 100.

44
00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:17.505
And he read them together as 1,350!

45
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:21.450
It's because you can't
read so well anymore!

46
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.739
How did you come up with that math?

47
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.270
No, the receipt said 135 dollars.

48
00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:30.263
I was drunk, and thought
it said 1,350 dollars.

49
00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:31.349
I was just drunk.

50
00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:33.786
He didn't look good at all.

51
00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:36.770
(You can see him bragging about it)

52
00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.185
When should I go sit down?

53
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:43.286
(Missed his timing to sit)

54
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:45.481
He kept twiddling his thumbs here.

55
00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:47.958
(Feeling awkward)

56
00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:53.013
It's important to note that he bought us
dinner for being the class president.

57
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.528
(Thanks, Jang-hoon!)

58
00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:57.630
What if Kyung-hoon became the president?

59
00:02:57.638 --> 00:03:00.044
Nothing at all, I'm sure!

60
00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:02.231
But honestly,

61
00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:05.513
I don't have any problem with
my eyesight for normal things.

62
00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:08.333
- But sometimes I can't see clearly.
- You know why?

63
00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:12.997
It's because you're always frowning
when you look at something.

64
00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:15.294
That's bad for your eyesight.

65
00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.458
(The giant is always frowning)

66
00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:20.208
What should he do to see better?

67
00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:22.544
I met a guy in Mongolia with 9.0 eyesight!

68
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.880
I asked, "What's over there?"

69
00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:26.841
He was like, "3 horses and 2 zebras."

70
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.763
(You're totally lying!)

71
00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:31.879
I went to Mongolia, and
that's what he said!

72
00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:32.942
He had a 9.0 eyesight!

73
00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:34.216
How is 9.0 possible?

74
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.302
He might see through people's intestines!

75
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.552
And he could!

76
00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:39.981
But Yeong-cheol

77
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:43.505
should focus on his own future.

78
00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:46.028
9.0!

79
00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:49.380
There are no tall buildings in Mongolia.

80
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.567
(Boa and Lee Sang-yeob!)

81
00:03:58.507 --> 00:04:00.144
Oh, Director!

82
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.067
(Director Kwon, please
take good care of me!)

83
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:07.145
(She's a member of the board of
director at his management company)

84
00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:09.583
Director Kwon's here!

85
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.935
Aren't you being too humble?

86
00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.185
You better do it right!

87
00:04:13.216 --> 00:04:15.122
We should stick to our own style!

88
00:04:15.147 --> 00:04:16.731
You think so?

89
00:04:16.748 --> 00:04:19.630
Please, tell us where you're from.

90
00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.278
He's been waiting to say that.

91
00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.888
(He's in the same management label as well)

92
00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:30.122
Hello, I'm from "the Eternal
Star of Asia" high school,

93
00:04:30.147 --> 00:04:32.061
I'm BoA.

94
00:04:32.732 --> 00:04:34.747
(A great welcome!)

95
00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:38.536
Hey, it's Park Hyun-bin!

96
00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.341
(He looks like the popular trot singer)

97
00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:45.645
Park Hyun-bin!

98
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.755
The management told me not to do this!

99
00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:02.583
The management was worried about me.

100
00:05:02.607 --> 00:05:04.661
Hello! I'm...

101
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:06.888
(What a funny guy!)

102
00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:08.880
Next to me were...

103
00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:11.458
Suzy, Kim Tae-hee, Kim Hye-soo,

104
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.950
And BoA!

105
00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.520
That's the school I was from.

106
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.286
And I'm Lee Sang-yeob, man!

107
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:20.286
You sound just too excited right now.

108
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:21.950
(Darn it)

109
00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:23.887
(You need to calm down!)

110
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.919
I love this show, actually.

111
00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:28.145
I've been really wanting
to come on this show.

112
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:31.614
I heard BoA was coming, so I came along.

113
00:05:32.154 --> 00:05:34.224
They were in the same drama together.

114
00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:37.770
You were a couple in "My Wife
is Cheating on Me This Week"!

115
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:40.567
It was my debut on TV drama, too!
I was a method actor.

116
00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:42.380
Cue the clip!

117
00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:45.520
What's going on today?

118
00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:50.403
Aren't you too heated up,
just because she's your boss?

119
00:05:50.677 --> 00:05:52.344
It's a bit of a pressure.

120
00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:55.247
Ho-dong, Sang-min told me to tell you this.

121
00:05:55.294 --> 00:05:57.755
He said you should cut out a show.

122
00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:00.872
(Sang-min couldn't stand it)

123
00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:04.778
(Shocked by his remark)

124
00:06:05.638 --> 00:06:08.388
It does feel like it's a
bit too much these days.

125
00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.239
He should cut out 2!

126
00:06:10.255 --> 00:06:12.270
Yeah, he's doing too many these days.

127
00:06:13.463 --> 00:06:19.130
It's amazing, because she doesn't make
friends with anyone she works with.

128
00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.969
She's shy around strangers.

129
00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:22.875
How'd you guys get close?

130
00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:27.419
- We drank.
- That's how we became friends.

131
00:06:27.583 --> 00:06:31.802
I feel like BoA just thinks
of Sang-yeub as a friend.

132
00:06:31.818 --> 00:06:33.951
But Sang-yeub's got other ideas.

133
00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:36.638
Yeah, they got something going on.

134
00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:39.849
I can see it on his face!

135
00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:44.138
When did you start to
have feelings for her?

136
00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:45.200
You can tell us.

137
00:06:45.232 --> 00:06:48.122
Oh no, she's Director Kwon!

138
00:06:48.496 --> 00:06:51.192
It's odd that you don't
have feelings for her.

139
00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.161
She drew a clear line
ever since the beginning.

140
00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:56.356
She made sure we were
friends, maybe best friends.

141
00:06:56.388 --> 00:06:57.997
I couldn't imagine
anything more than that.

142
00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:01.122
Lines are meant for you to cross.

143
00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:04.255
It's worth dying for, to cross them over!

144
00:07:04.568 --> 00:07:07.794
(Every couple starts off as friends!)

145
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:12.200
I can see read people's faces.

146
00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:18.130
Sang-yeun looks like he was
a funny kid growing up.

147
00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:20.520
You really can read faces?

148
00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:22.841
Want me to tell you your future?

149
00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:26.927
I was a loud kid, running
around everywhere.

150
00:07:26.974 --> 00:07:28.606
But when I was in 6th grade,

151
00:07:28.638 --> 00:07:31.731
Seo Taiji and Boys's "Come
Back Home" was a popular song.

152
00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:35.028
I'd go up and do that dance
in front of everyone.

153
00:07:35.044 --> 00:07:36.856
I'd do this!

154
00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:39.560
That's how they danced?

155
00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:41.481
Who'd come home like this?

156
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.442
That was their dance!

157
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:47.278
It looks like the traditional mask-dance.

158
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:49.677
I also wrote a paper on g.o.d
when I was in high school.

159
00:07:49.693 --> 00:07:51.544
I played Kim Tae-woo.

160
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.216
(How'd you do their dance?)

161
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:56.849
(Famous for their sharp angles)

162
00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:02.864
(Like driving a tour bus)

163
00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:08.739
Can't you see that I'm working so hard?

164
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:10.942
You're working hard, but
Yeong-cheol does, too.

165
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.997
I'm sorry, I wasn't so good.

166
00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:15.474
I didn't have a good look on you.

167
00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:18.091
I heard you can do others' voices.

168
00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:24.091
I've been wanting to meet Hee-chul for
the longest time, from seeing this show.

169
00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:26.411
- You too?
- Kim Yeong-cheol the actor...

170
00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:28.669
Hee-chul's so good at doing his voice.

171
00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:33.223
Have a conversation as
Gung Ye, both of you.

172
00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:36.114
Find the real Gung Ye!

173
00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:38.333
BoA's an expert audition judge.

174
00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:42.153
Act like Kim Yeong-cheol in front
of me, the other Kim Yeong-cheol.

175
00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:44.192
Super star Kim Yeong-cheol!

176
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.091
You got misfortune all over your face!

177
00:08:47.107 --> 00:08:49.185
Who made that coughing sound?

178
00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:51.716
(He's the real Gung Ye!)

179
00:08:52.988 --> 00:08:56.161
(Hee-chul's Gung Ye beats everyone)

180
00:08:58.473 --> 00:08:59.810
He's so good!

181
00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:02.724
Anything else? Can you
do someone else's voice?

182
00:09:02.818 --> 00:09:04.778
I can do Jung Woo-sung.

183
00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:06.810
That's pretty hard.

184
00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:10.544
I came on "Ask Us Anything" today.

185
00:09:13.116 --> 00:09:15.833
(He sounds just like him!)

186
00:09:16.045 --> 00:09:17.739
(Confidence level rising)

187
00:09:17.764 --> 00:09:19.583
He's really good at this!

188
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:24.880
Don't Kim Yeong-cheol's voice
ever again like earlier.

189
00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:26.013
But this one's much better.

190
00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.122
Then from Jung Woo-sung...

191
00:09:28.147 --> 00:09:30.645
I can try Jang Hyuk.

192
00:09:31.615 --> 00:09:33.215
Hell, I'm Jang Hyuk.

193
00:09:34.036 --> 00:09:36.786
"Un-nyun!" [a drama character]

194
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.224
That's good!

195
00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.747
(Looking much brighter)

196
00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:43.778
That was good!

197
00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:46.044
(Looking forward to the next one)

198
00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:47.708
I was a huge fan of Sang-min.

199
00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:49.841
His group, "Bros"!

200
00:09:49.865 --> 00:09:51.794
I loved their song, "Win, win."

201
00:09:51.873 --> 00:09:53.673
I loved his "shouting" rap.

202
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:04.161
(Battle over "crying" rap)

203
00:10:07.782 --> 00:10:10.067
(Sang-min is touched)

204
00:10:10.823 --> 00:10:12.067
(Dizzy)

205
00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:15.239
Sang-min, come on up here.

206
00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:17.685
You gotta do it with them!

207
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.935
OK, this is "Hidden Sang-min!"

208
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.552
(You try to guess, too!)

209
00:10:24.615 --> 00:10:26.614
Guess who the real Sang-min is!

210
00:10:33.581 --> 00:10:35.755
(They sound the same!)

211
00:10:42.913 --> 00:10:45.192
(The real Lee Sang-min was #3!)

212
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.614
I think you would've been voted out
first if you really went on the show.

213
00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:52.169
The original's worse!

214
00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:54.606
(The impersonators were better)

215
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.044
My management was really worried
that I'd do something like this.

216
00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:02.222
You sounded like Kim Rae-won just now.

217
00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:06.380
(Trying him out on the spot)

218
00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:08.395
Did you... Have to...

219
00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.833
He does this thing with his nostrils too.

220
00:11:10.888 --> 00:11:13.060
Do that to me?

221
00:11:13.888 --> 00:11:15.989
(That was good too!)

222
00:11:16.388 --> 00:11:19.770
(Finishing off with
Sang-min's "crying" rap)

223
00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:22.475
Do the slave hunter!

224
00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:24.380
"Un-nyun!"

225
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:25.997
Then Jung Woo-sung!

226
00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:27.950
Did you eat?

227
00:11:28.768 --> 00:11:30.368
(He's the best!)

228
00:11:31.093 --> 00:11:36.052
Why did he choose to do Gung Ye
earlier, when he can do others better?

229
00:11:36.138 --> 00:11:38.513
Misfortunes all over my portion!

230
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:40.630
(He's still going for it)

231
00:11:40.646 --> 00:11:41.825
Don't do that one.

232
00:11:41.856 --> 00:11:44.270
BoA, you don't have anything to show?

233
00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:45.536
You have many talents, too!

234
00:11:45.552 --> 00:11:47.825
I really have nothing to show.

235
00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:49.583
You can't do the head-voice thing?

236
00:11:49.607 --> 00:11:51.372
You can't do the "ssam-ja" voice?

237
00:12:01.983 --> 00:12:04.810
(Ho-dong's response is too much,
his intention is skeptical)

238
00:12:04.826 --> 00:12:06.966
She must be so taken aback!

239
00:12:07.004 --> 00:12:08.825
She's not my boss.

240
00:12:11.457 --> 00:12:14.458
(Kyung-hoon's clear-cut between
business and friendship)

241
00:12:15.512 --> 00:12:17.036
Give us your applications.

242
00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:18.911
You filled it out, right?

243
00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:21.294
I did!

244
00:12:21.434 --> 00:12:22.560
Bring it here!

245
00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:23.895
Wait, hold on.

246
00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:26.231
Sang-yeub prepared a lot
to make us laugh today.

247
00:12:26.263 --> 00:12:30.330
I'm sure he'll make us laugh
from just the way he walks over.

248
00:12:30.627 --> 00:12:32.489
He's putting you on the spot!

249
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.872
Whatever he planned is gonna
be a complete failure.

250
00:12:34.896 --> 00:12:37.560
You'll see how your
hard-labor becomes nothing.

251
00:12:38.145 --> 00:12:40.560
(It's too much pressure!)

252
00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:43.028
He's just 7 steps away.

253
00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:45.177
He's gonna do something unprecedented!

254
00:12:45.883 --> 00:12:48.372
Soo-geun!

255
00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:50.489
(He made it happen on the spot)

256
00:12:50.655 --> 00:12:52.653
(Great effort!)

257
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.825
(Finishing up with "crying" rap, of course)

258
00:12:57.979 --> 00:13:00.864
(Perfect for Ho-dong's taste of humor)

259
00:13:03.635 --> 00:13:06.185
(He might be invited to an
island for Ho-dong's other show)

260
00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:11.989
It's all over his face that he'll be
fishing with Ho-dong on an island.

261
00:13:12.212 --> 00:13:14.544
Or ringing the doorbell
at a stranger's house!

262
00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:16.458
Going over their application.

263
00:13:16.513 --> 00:13:18.427
Name: Kwon BoA.

264
00:13:19.377 --> 00:13:20.560
It's her real name.

265
00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:24.450
Not only that, it's got Chinese
characters for the meaning.

266
00:13:24.482 --> 00:13:26.794
People think it's a pure Hangul name.

267
00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:27.841
What does it mean?

268
00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:29.981
"A jade pearl" and "clarity."

269
00:13:29.998 --> 00:13:31.185
That's a great name!

270
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:34.372
That's why you always enjoy
that clear bottle of soju!

271
00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:37.028
I only drink "the true dew" kind.

272
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.825
Sang-yeub's nickname is

273
00:13:38.872 --> 00:13:40.472
"Horse muscles."

274
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.216
Horse muscles?

275
00:13:42.248 --> 00:13:45.466
I was running one day in
high school wearing shorts.

276
00:13:45.505 --> 00:13:49.544
And my friends saw my
muscle line on my legs.

277
00:13:49.568 --> 00:13:52.028
They looked like a horse's leg muscles.

278
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:53.419
Drop your pants then.

279
00:13:54.178 --> 00:13:56.435
- Me?
- You gotta show us!

280
00:13:57.092 --> 00:13:58.755
He might do it for real!

281
00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:03.591
Soo-geun was joking, but Sang-yeun was...

282
00:14:03.654 --> 00:14:05.661
"Should I really drop my pants?"

283
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.528
Is this how it works here?

284
00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:11.724
If we were serious about it
convinced him, he might just do it.

285
00:14:12.927 --> 00:14:14.458
He might just do it!

286
00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:18.786
Sang-yeub's dream partner is...

287
00:14:19.224 --> 00:14:20.739
This is odd.

288
00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:23.810
- Is it Kim Yeong-cheol?
- Jang Sung-kyu.

289
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.372
What's the reason?

290
00:14:27.397 --> 00:14:31.169
"I can't help but to look
up to his sense of humor."

291
00:14:31.194 --> 00:14:32.888
He's not even here!

292
00:14:33.028 --> 00:14:33.919
He wants to get big.

293
00:14:33.927 --> 00:14:35.216
It's not about that.

294
00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:40.880
I'm being completely honest, I've
never seen a character like him.

295
00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:42.130
He's so unique!

296
00:14:42.177 --> 00:14:45.997
I think he's so funny, you
texted me just last night!

297
00:14:46.037 --> 00:14:48.067
You asked me to take care of you.

298
00:14:48.918 --> 00:14:50.700
You know each other?

299
00:14:50.802 --> 00:14:51.942
How?

300
00:14:51.982 --> 00:14:54.536
We met a few times at fashion shows.

301
00:14:54.887 --> 00:14:57.091
(Jeers pour in)

302
00:14:57.116 --> 00:14:59.591
What's wrong with going to fashion shows?

303
00:14:59.623 --> 00:15:01.731
Should I just stay home all day?

304
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:05.716
But I get updated on fashion
trends from his Instagram.

305
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.380
(Yeong-cheol is actually
very fashion-forward)

306
00:15:09.503 --> 00:15:12.161
You like me better? Or Jang Sung-kyu?

307
00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:15.041
(Baffled by this difficult question)

308
00:15:15.068 --> 00:15:16.403
Why's that of any importance?

309
00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:18.395
You gotta look at the big
picture, the overall flow.

310
00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:20.356
That's your job!

311
00:15:20.381 --> 00:15:22.013
I'm gonna focus on myself.

312
00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:24.567
I'm all about me, and
that's enough already.

313
00:15:24.622 --> 00:15:26.286
I don't need to see the big picture!

314
00:15:26.311 --> 00:15:28.981
What is it that I should
look for in the picture?

315
00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:31.794
He's got a new direction this year.

316
00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:33.614
Be quiet!

317
00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:35.406
BoA's dream partner is...

318
00:15:35.458 --> 00:15:38.286
Who do you think she chose?

319
00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:40.567
Soo-geun.

320
00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:42.505
It's gotta be Soo-geun.

321
00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:44.709
Either Soo-geun or me, I'm sure.

322
00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:47.388
Lee Soo-geun, unanimously.

323
00:15:47.521 --> 00:15:49.950
Do you know the meaning of
the word, "unanimously"?

324
00:15:50.052 --> 00:15:53.817
Yes, among all the emotions in BoA's heart,

325
00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:56.208
all those emotions
unanimously voted for me.

326
00:15:56.475 --> 00:15:58.255
(Puzzled)

327
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.263
All of her emotions took a vote, and

328
00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:03.974
voted for me unanimously.

329
00:16:04.052 --> 00:16:06.013
Congratulations.

330
00:16:06.352 --> 00:16:08.153
(Chosen by BoA)

331
00:16:08.981 --> 00:16:10.411
She finds me the most comfortable.

332
00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.216
Why's that?

333
00:16:11.248 --> 00:16:14.817
She didn't choose you, Ho-dong, because
she's not comfortable with you.

334
00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:17.208
We should do a section where
you guys can become close.

335
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:19.075
BoA, try this.

336
00:16:19.136 --> 00:16:21.099
Show her how it's done.

337
00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:23.231
Say,

338
00:16:23.255 --> 00:16:24.825
"Let's become close friend!"

339
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.411
(You're so kind, Ho-dong!)

340
00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:29.931
Really?

341
00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:33.270
(Ho-dong's face is about to burst)

342
00:16:33.624 --> 00:16:35.380
(Walking over like a baby)

343
00:16:36.581 --> 00:16:38.919
(What should I do?)

344
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.067
(His face is so big!)

345
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:43.263
He actually kinda likes this.

346
00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.169
I don't!

347
00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:47.638
Ho-dong!

348
00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:49.435
Let's be close friends!

349
00:16:51.168 --> 00:16:52.768
(How cute!)

350
00:16:53.438 --> 00:16:55.833
(Embarrassed)

351
00:16:56.106 --> 00:16:59.052
(He's totally blushing at her touch)

352
00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:01.786
He's so red now.

353
00:17:02.184 --> 00:17:03.872
How can I not turn red?

354
00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:06.708
He's like a stone monument of this show.

355
00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:09.356
Yeah, you touch it for good fortune.

356
00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:11.497
I hope I do!

357
00:17:11.638 --> 00:17:14.317
(Hope everyone becomes
close friends from now on)

358
00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:18.161
Sang-yeub, you get really nervous
when you start to get less attention?

359
00:17:18.835 --> 00:17:20.872
(Can't hide his nervousness through acting)

360
00:17:20.912 --> 00:17:23.752
He looks around like this in that short
moment of not getting attention.

361
00:17:24.123 --> 00:17:26.770
(I liked it when I was
doing the voices earlier)

362
00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:29.224
Hello, Mr. Jung Woo-sung! How are you?

363
00:17:29.278 --> 00:17:30.903
Did you eat?

364
00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.989
(Totally satisfied)

365
00:17:33.864 --> 00:17:35.464
He says that every time!

366
00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:36.622
"Hey, we should break up."

367
00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.052
"Did you eat?"

368
00:17:38.077 --> 00:17:40.028
He might ask that while you're eating.

369
00:17:40.053 --> 00:17:42.334
(He's like a robot with the same question)

370
00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:44.208
Jung Woo-sung, come and eat with us.

371
00:17:44.232 --> 00:17:45.832
This is really good!

372
00:17:45.935 --> 00:17:47.708
Did you eat?

373
00:17:47.862 --> 00:17:50.317
(Always concerned if others ate)

374
00:17:51.047 --> 00:17:54.255
I'm pretty sure you have to do that
like 30 times before you go home today.

375
00:17:54.568 --> 00:17:56.802
(To Ho-dong's satisfaction)

376
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.786
(He's like a jukebox)

377
00:18:00.638 --> 00:18:02.474
Sang-yeub's strength is,

378
00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:07.497
well, it's one of the reasons
he chose Jang Sung-kyu,

379
00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:10.583
that he's got better
pronunciation than news anchors.

380
00:18:10.638 --> 00:18:13.075
He can read things fast accurately,
we used to do that here.

381
00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:16.403
(Read things fast but with
accurate pronunciation)

382
00:18:16.473 --> 00:18:20.442
I had to practice how to project my voice.

383
00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.403
And I tried reading the script fast.

384
00:18:22.443 --> 00:18:23.763
OK, Sang-yeub.

385
00:18:23.801 --> 00:18:25.778
We're good at this too, but

386
00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:27.716
we have a broadcasting class member.

387
00:18:27.763 --> 00:18:29.911
You should beat him first
then go against us.

388
00:18:30.347 --> 00:18:31.653
(The real pros come last)

389
00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.388
You gotta beat someone else first.

390
00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:36.255
Broadcasting class members! Where are you?

391
00:18:36.591 --> 00:18:38.372
Broadcasting class!

392
00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:42.880
It's really Jang Sung-kyu!

393
00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:50.872
It's really Jang Sung-kyu!

394
00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:53.481
It's his first time here a a student!

395
00:18:54.336 --> 00:18:59.005
No one was this happy to
see Jang Sung-kyu before.

396
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.770
Look how happy he is!

397
00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:02.872
I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity!

398
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:05.270
(Sung-kyu didn't expect it either)

399
00:19:05.326 --> 00:19:06.708
Sang-yeub!

400
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.083
Thanks, man.

401
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:10.428
I've been wanting to see you, man!

402
00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:12.208
You two are close?

403
00:19:12.387 --> 00:19:14.161
We've never met before.

404
00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:17.094
Sung-kyu, but as of recent...

405
00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:19.325
Have you been trying to
gain weight on purpose?

406
00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.403
He got a lot bigger.

407
00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:25.372
You're wearing a muscle costume inside?

408
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:27.747
Take it off!

409
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.270
You have your old picture
up in your profile.

410
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.388
I weigh 100.3 kg now.

411
00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:34.058
(Shocked)

412
00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:36.786
Is there another news anchor in
Korea who weighs more than 100 kg?

413
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.060
I heard I'm the first one ever!

414
00:19:40.852 --> 00:19:42.794
A heavy weight news anchor!

415
00:19:42.819 --> 00:19:44.739
(Champion among news anchors)

416
00:19:45.222 --> 00:19:47.239
You look scary after you gained weight.

417
00:19:48.941 --> 00:19:51.083
He's always standing like this now.

418
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.520
I'll introduce myself.

419
00:19:55.552 --> 00:19:57.935
I have the best pronunciation
in this school.

420
00:19:57.982 --> 00:19:59.388
I'm Jang Diction.

421
00:19:59.474 --> 00:20:01.974
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, man!

422
00:20:03.194 --> 00:20:06.036
We prepared something, come up here.

423
00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:08.566
How about BoA gives it a try first?

424
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:11.185
Let's have BoA go first, but she's
not part of the main match.

425
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.216
You gotta read accurately
under a time line.

426
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.255
What is it?

427
00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:17.435
(Eyes wide open)

428
00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.333
It's hard to read the letters, even.

429
00:20:22.047 --> 00:20:23.388
(Speechless)

430
00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:25.622
It's a very difficult
content they prepared.

431
00:20:25.662 --> 00:20:27.739
(Already in practice mode)

432
00:20:27.966 --> 00:20:30.247
(BoA is the first challenger)

433
00:20:30.302 --> 00:20:31.935
Start!

434
00:20:36.057 --> 00:20:37.825
(Pretty good!)

435
00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:44.106
(How's she so good?)

436
00:20:45.325 --> 00:20:47.122
(She seems so experienced)

437
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.099
Where did you find this? This is so hard!

438
00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:02.255
(Reading well through
difficult words to enunciate)

439
00:21:05.158 --> 00:21:07.677
(Almost to the finish line!)

440
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.692
(Fails at the end!)

441
00:21:12.724 --> 00:21:14.324
But she did so well!

442
00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:16.091
You're incredibly good!

443
00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:19.200
(She couldn't quite finish,
but she was excellent)

444
00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:21.536
There were so many words
I've never heard before.

445
00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:23.091
Next! Sang-yeub first? Or...

446
00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.341
No, no.

447
00:21:24.373 --> 00:21:26.091
Sung-kyu first!

448
00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:29.716
(What's he doing all of a sudden?)

449
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:31.013
What are you doing here?

450
00:21:31.052 --> 00:21:32.435
I want to give it a try.

451
00:21:32.451 --> 00:21:34.851
- Try what?
- I've been practicing.

452
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.958
How much time do I get?

453
00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:42.497
You'll still be first place if you take
your time and finish in 60 minutes.

454
00:21:42.787 --> 00:21:44.739
Ready, start!

455
00:21:48.861 --> 00:21:50.911
(So embarrassed)

456
00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:54.435
(Ho-dong fails from the get-go)

457
00:21:54.505 --> 00:21:56.630
He said 6,000 years instead of 600!

458
00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:59.013
I didn't do that on purpose.

459
00:22:00.292 --> 00:22:02.138
That's a very long time.

460
00:22:02.163 --> 00:22:03.763
(Mouth wide open)

461
00:22:04.662 --> 00:22:06.856
(Jang Diction is up next!)

462
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.825
I'll go last, I'm relaxed.

463
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.981
I am a professional news anchor.

464
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.177
I'll show you what accurate
pronunciation means.

465
00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:18.544
He gained weight on his mouth too.

466
00:22:19.827 --> 00:22:23.130
Prove it to us that you
can't do news anymore.

467
00:22:24.403 --> 00:22:26.380
(Actor vs. Anchor)

468
00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:28.489
Start!

469
00:22:34.427 --> 00:22:36.763
(Watching like a hawk)

470
00:22:37.178 --> 00:22:40.888
(He may be funny, but
he's a real news anchor)

471
00:22:50.043 --> 00:22:51.833
(I got it wrong?)

472
00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:53.536
It's "Danube," not "Dinube"!

473
00:22:53.599 --> 00:22:55.700
- Isn't that what I said?
- You said "Dinube."

474
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.653
(He's practically begging)

475
00:22:58.102 --> 00:23:02.778
It's like saying, "This is JTBC
News Bang," instead of "News Room."

476
00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:05.958
Bye bye, news.

477
00:23:05.998 --> 00:23:08.552
Huge difference between
Danube and "Dinube."

478
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:14.192
- Sang-yeub's next!
- You better last longer than me.

479
00:23:14.335 --> 00:23:16.122
(No one actually succeeded yet)

480
00:23:17.547 --> 00:23:19.708
Ready... Start!

481
00:23:28.427 --> 00:23:30.231
(Nervous)

482
00:23:35.568 --> 00:23:38.411
(He already beat Sung-kyu)

483
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:40.591
(Darn it)

484
00:23:44.845 --> 00:23:47.489
(Sang-yeub failed in completing it too)

485
00:23:47.514 --> 00:23:49.114
Not it!

486
00:23:49.139 --> 00:23:51.817
Then BoA's the champion, out of nowhere.

487
00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:56.388
(BoA wins for going the farthest)

488
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.035
She does watch our show!

489
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.966
This isn't for us, BoA.

490
00:24:00.013 --> 00:24:01.966
Let me show you.

491
00:24:02.154 --> 00:24:03.958
(We have a separate camera for us)

492
00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:05.099
I'll show you.

493
00:24:05.138 --> 00:24:06.427
(Walks...)

494
00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:07.872
(Right on by)

495
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:12.286
(This is our camera!)

496
00:24:12.802 --> 00:24:15.747
(The Jimmy Jib is only for the giant)

497
00:24:16.652 --> 00:24:18.020
Cue!

498
00:24:20.321 --> 00:24:22.895
(Hello, ENG camera!)

499
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.395
Good job, BoA!

500
00:24:25.663 --> 00:24:27.583
(She's good at doing ceremonies too!)

501
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:29.677
So, broadcasting class!

502
00:24:29.732 --> 00:24:31.833
You can go on now, make
announcements later.

503
00:24:31.896 --> 00:24:34.255
Oh, it's time for me to leave already?

504
00:24:35.756 --> 00:24:37.013
Great work!

505
00:24:37.052 --> 00:24:39.716
- Bye!
- Leave, man!

506
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.106
Sung-kyu!

507
00:24:43.138 --> 00:24:45.552
The camera captures you again
if you leave this way.

508
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:47.606
(Thanks, Soo-geun!)

509
00:24:47.984 --> 00:24:49.919
Sung-kyu! The stairs!

510
00:24:51.995 --> 00:24:54.817
(Jang Diction loses out on news,
but wins in making people laugh)

511
00:24:55.005 --> 00:24:56.458
I love that guy!

512
00:24:56.552 --> 00:24:58.575
He's a real news anchor?

513
00:24:59.949 --> 00:25:01.044
Who did you think it was?

514
00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:03.185
He's a main anchorman of JTBC.

515
00:25:03.608 --> 00:25:05.333
(Never heard of him)

516
00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:09.677
(Time to see BoA's strength)

517
00:25:09.732 --> 00:25:13.403
This is what we've been waiting for.

518
00:25:13.458 --> 00:25:15.106
Now it's time to see BoA's talent.

519
00:25:15.162 --> 00:25:16.622
As you know very well,

520
00:25:16.647 --> 00:25:20.317
her talent is the ability to repeat others'
dance routines like a copy machine.

521
00:25:20.365 --> 00:25:23.755
She can memorize any dance
routine right away.

522
00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:25.177
Like a copy machine!

523
00:25:25.208 --> 00:25:27.911
We prepared some random dance videos.

524
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:32.036
She'll watch the videos for
short moments, then repeat.

525
00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:34.864
Without anyone teaching her?
She'll just watch?

526
00:25:34.998 --> 00:25:37.231
I'm sure BoA can do it!

527
00:25:38.649 --> 00:25:40.427
Here's the first video.

528
00:25:41.943 --> 00:25:46.692
(Twice's "Likey," targeting
every man on earth)

529
00:25:49.994 --> 00:25:52.731
(Copying already)

530
00:25:53.758 --> 00:25:55.388
(He's trying, too)

531
00:25:58.278 --> 00:25:59.427
That's it?

532
00:25:59.466 --> 00:26:00.731
- One more time?
- Yes.

533
00:26:00.794 --> 00:26:02.247
OK, just once more.

534
00:26:02.272 --> 00:26:04.661
- You know this song?
- Yeah.

535
00:26:06.252 --> 00:26:09.013
(Hee-chul's an expert at girl-group dances)

536
00:26:11.784 --> 00:26:14.903
(BoA is very serious about this)

537
00:26:16.382 --> 00:26:19.325
(Even copying their facial expressions)

538
00:26:20.677 --> 00:26:22.427
I memorized it already.

539
00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:26.427
(A genius when it comes
to girl-group dances)

540
00:26:26.564 --> 00:26:29.380
Let's try it without the video now.

541
00:26:29.405 --> 00:26:30.834
I can't watch along?

542
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:34.060
(BoA's version of "Likey")

543
00:26:34.586 --> 00:26:35.981
(Looking cute)

544
00:26:36.006 --> 00:26:38.739
(More powerful dance
lines than the original)

545
00:26:40.609 --> 00:26:43.276
(Perfectly copied without any mistakes!)

546
00:26:45.194 --> 00:26:47.458
(Crowd goes wild)

547
00:26:47.483 --> 00:26:49.685
She's got her own feel to it!

548
00:26:49.971 --> 00:26:52.481
(The dancing machine!)

549
00:26:52.704 --> 00:26:54.700
We gotta point this out, it's
your first time seeing it?

550
00:26:54.732 --> 00:26:57.263
I did see this on TV a few times.

551
00:26:57.309 --> 00:27:00.552
But you never studied their
dance routine in detail, right?

552
00:27:01.682 --> 00:27:03.106
First time doing this?

553
00:27:03.185 --> 00:27:05.552
Yeah, I just pay attention to the formula.

554
00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:07.778
I count what repeats how many times.

555
00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.270
Just like how math geniuses
memorize math equations!

556
00:27:10.318 --> 00:27:12.388
She's got that ability.

557
00:27:12.504 --> 00:27:15.013
This is doable, it's got
a lot of hand motions.

558
00:27:15.038 --> 00:27:17.067
I can't do it if the routine's
got a lot of steps.

559
00:27:17.107 --> 00:27:18.802
Let's go on to the next video.

560
00:27:18.827 --> 00:27:20.169
You won't get this, no way.

561
00:27:20.775 --> 00:27:22.841
No way she can do this!

562
00:27:23.443 --> 00:27:25.481
(The dance genius Sam-ja's
"monthly rent" dance)

563
00:27:25.724 --> 00:27:27.747
(Very difficult and abstract)

564
00:27:27.973 --> 00:27:29.239
He's good! A good dancer!

565
00:27:30.918 --> 00:27:33.255
You were totally in love
with my dance moves!

566
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:40.075
(Flipping his eyes is the
highlight of this dance)

567
00:27:43.087 --> 00:27:45.435
I don't even remember that dance.

568
00:27:45.763 --> 00:27:47.599
I don't even remember it.

569
00:27:48.498 --> 00:27:49.802
This is...

570
00:27:49.841 --> 00:27:51.441
A dance?

571
00:27:51.466 --> 00:27:53.864
(What did you say?)

572
00:27:58.023 --> 00:27:59.606
(Looking natural)

573
00:28:02.757 --> 00:28:04.638
(Embarrassed at Ho-dong's compliment)

574
00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:08.177
(BoA's upgraded version of
"the monthly rent dance")

575
00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:11.317
(Now comes the highlight!)

576
00:28:13.868 --> 00:28:15.692
(I'll just go for it)

577
00:28:16.436 --> 00:28:19.903
(A perfect copy of even
the most difficult move!)

578
00:28:20.133 --> 00:28:23.520
This must hurt her ego, it's like calling
Bill Gates over and asking him if

579
00:28:23.537 --> 00:28:25.372
he knows how to use a computer.

580
00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:28.888
(BoA gladly donated her
talent for this school)

581
00:28:29.021 --> 00:28:30.770
I wanna see "It's Me" by BoA.

582
00:28:31.182 --> 00:28:33.028
I did see that dance many times.

583
00:28:33.068 --> 00:28:35.575
It doesn't have to be
exactly the same, right?

584
00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:38.731
There's no prize even if
it were exactly the same.

585
00:28:39.294 --> 00:28:40.653
Music, please.

586
00:28:40.732 --> 00:28:44.255
I won't do the turn because
I'm wearing a skirt.

587
00:28:45.518 --> 00:28:48.325
(Powerful!)

588
00:28:49.808 --> 00:28:52.560
(She would've been voted
on the show for sure!)

589
00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:58.067
(I'm the dance copier!)

590
00:29:03.331 --> 00:29:06.060
Welcome, Sang-yeub and BoA!

591
00:29:08.306 --> 00:29:10.763
(Guess things about me quiz)

592
00:29:11.196 --> 00:29:17.067
Kang Ho-dong, Lee Soo-geun, Kim Hee-chul,
you act like you know me so well.

593
00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:18.911
Are you reading a script?

594
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.550
Yes, I am.

595
00:29:20.615 --> 00:29:22.935
Your portion's got misfortune all over it!

596
00:29:23.623 --> 00:29:25.638
(Gung Ye pops out randomly)

597
00:29:26.108 --> 00:29:28.810
(This is how he secures
his portion on the show!)

598
00:29:29.208 --> 00:29:30.935
(Who laughs at this joke?)

599
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.286
He's funny!

600
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:35.833
(I'd like to take him under my wings!)

601
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.942
You're better at doing other voices!

602
00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:43.466
I'll meet him at the entertainment
awards show at the end of the year.

603
00:29:43.491 --> 00:29:45.185
He'll be with Ho-dong everywhere.

604
00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.816
I'm sure he will.

605
00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:50.715
There's something I do
before every show or shoot.

606
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.755
(You can't do this)

607
00:29:52.888 --> 00:29:54.849
This is why Director Kwon didn't
want to come on the show.

608
00:29:54.874 --> 00:29:56.474
She knew I'd get it right!

609
00:29:56.552 --> 00:29:58.152
(That's not it!)

610
00:29:58.365 --> 00:30:00.591
Just like Ha Jung-woo in
"Nameless Gangster..."

611
00:30:00.631 --> 00:30:03.130
She gargles with soju.

612
00:30:03.209 --> 00:30:04.763
Then she goes on.

613
00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:08.285
This is something I do before
every scheduled event.

614
00:30:08.317 --> 00:30:11.216
Before I stand in front
of people or cameras.

615
00:30:11.256 --> 00:30:15.661
I can share what I saw when I'd visit
you in the waiting room, right?

616
00:30:17.326 --> 00:30:18.591
You gather the dancers.

617
00:30:18.646 --> 00:30:21.200
You have them line up and discipline them.

618
00:30:21.869 --> 00:30:23.263
Come on!

619
00:30:23.897 --> 00:30:25.677
That's what you do!

620
00:30:26.089 --> 00:30:27.794
Me?

621
00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:31.794
You check if the money's
been deposited first.

622
00:30:31.873 --> 00:30:33.958
(Wrong answer but...)

623
00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:36.247
It is important.

624
00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:39.693
You practice introducing yourself?

625
00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:43.607
"Hello, I'm the star of Asia, BoA!"

626
00:30:43.763 --> 00:30:45.786
"Hello, I'm the star of Asia, BoA!"

627
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:48.654
What is that?

628
00:30:48.692 --> 00:30:50.292
When did I ever do that?

629
00:30:50.326 --> 00:30:52.513
I'm sure he's not done yet, so then?

630
00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:54.599
(Pressured)

631
00:30:54.662 --> 00:30:56.490
You got misfortunes on your portion!

632
00:30:56.537 --> 00:30:58.536
Stop it already!

633
00:30:58.576 --> 00:31:00.536
(Making sure he secures his part)

634
00:31:00.593 --> 00:31:02.303
Stop it!

635
00:31:02.484 --> 00:31:04.194
(Then how about...)

636
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.373
Mr. Jung Woo-sung?

637
00:31:07.458 --> 00:31:09.569
Did you eat?

638
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:13.475
(He's always curious about if others ate)

639
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.452
(It's actually BoA's turn now)

640
00:31:16.788 --> 00:31:18.803
Sorry!

641
00:31:18.984 --> 00:31:20.624
I'm just feeling so up!

642
00:31:20.701 --> 00:31:22.358
Sang-yeub's close to BoA too.

643
00:31:22.398 --> 00:31:25.428
What does she do before the shoot starts?

644
00:31:25.507 --> 00:31:27.999
I just remember her looking at the mirror.

645
00:31:28.851 --> 00:31:30.311
Looking at the mirror?

646
00:31:30.336 --> 00:31:33.077
You check if something's on your face.

647
00:31:33.102 --> 00:31:35.035
You do this to your eyelashes.

648
00:31:36.113 --> 00:31:38.905
You check if anything's
stuck on your teeth!

649
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.796
But why do I do that?

650
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:46.757
You always check if
lipstick got on your teeth!

651
00:31:46.882 --> 00:31:48.374
Then you go on stage.

652
00:31:50.077 --> 00:31:51.983
That's correct!

653
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.741
(A spinning lipstick ceremony)

654
00:31:57.765 --> 00:31:59.147
People do check for that.

655
00:31:59.172 --> 00:32:02.592
I'm a little obsessed about that.

656
00:32:02.624 --> 00:32:06.194
It's because my teeth
show a lot when I laugh.

657
00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:09.757
Sometimes my gums even show.

658
00:32:09.804 --> 00:32:11.647
So I keep checking to make sure.

659
00:32:11.672 --> 00:32:14.124
But if I don't get to check...

660
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:15.608
Then I keep covering my mouth.

661
00:32:15.632 --> 00:32:17.022
Because you're worried?

662
00:32:17.077 --> 00:32:18.928
It gets on your teeth a lot though?

663
00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:21.553
Yeah, my lip curls up when I smile.

664
00:32:21.741 --> 00:32:24.811
It's because my top lip
curls up when I smile.

665
00:32:24.988 --> 00:32:27.194
(Trying it out for himself)

666
00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:29.936
"Hello! I'm BoA."

667
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.921
So you always carry around tissues?

668
00:32:33.984 --> 00:32:36.475
I have another reason for that.

669
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:38.647
- To poop!
- That's right!

670
00:32:38.694 --> 00:32:40.624
That was a great moment.

671
00:32:40.954 --> 00:32:45.217
I have one odd part on my body.

672
00:32:45.249 --> 00:32:46.584
You must sweat a lot.

673
00:32:46.632 --> 00:32:48.600
Wow, he's like a psychic!

674
00:32:48.687 --> 00:32:50.319
On your bellybutton?

675
00:32:51.608 --> 00:32:53.507
She sweats on her bellybutton?

676
00:32:53.532 --> 00:32:55.397
Forming drops of sweat.

677
00:32:55.421 --> 00:32:57.585
(A smashing hit)

678
00:32:57.947 --> 00:32:59.811
This is an actual question?

679
00:32:59.874 --> 00:33:03.366
It wasn't, but I guess
it turned out to be one.

680
00:33:03.452 --> 00:33:06.733
This must be why she
carries around tissues.

681
00:33:06.773 --> 00:33:09.085
Your armpits...

682
00:33:09.753 --> 00:33:12.124
I'd just put on a deodorant!

683
00:33:12.155 --> 00:33:14.507
- You have to keep wiping them?
- No.

684
00:33:14.608 --> 00:33:16.405
Your palms!

685
00:33:18.756 --> 00:33:20.249
You're right!

686
00:33:20.312 --> 00:33:23.358
I have sweaty palms.

687
00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:26.764
I can't even hold the mic with
just one hand the whole time.

688
00:33:26.788 --> 00:33:27.967
It gets slippery.

689
00:33:27.991 --> 00:33:30.186
So I switch hands and wipe.

690
00:33:30.288 --> 00:33:32.928
She uses a boom mic during summer.

691
00:33:32.999 --> 00:33:34.350
She can't hold the mic!

692
00:33:34.382 --> 00:33:35.624
You can't wear a glove?

693
00:33:35.687 --> 00:33:37.436
You've never shaken her hand, have you?

694
00:33:37.445 --> 00:33:38.445
You'd be shocked!

695
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.514
- You haven't either.
- I did earlier.

696
00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:42.296
That's because I washed
my hands right before.

697
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.460
Oh, is that right?

698
00:33:45.094 --> 00:33:49.413
I was wondering how she can go
around with her hands that sweaty!

699
00:33:49.741 --> 00:33:52.257
Her hand was totally wet!

700
00:33:52.282 --> 00:33:54.405
I thought she had a serious condition.

701
00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:57.194
(Her second question)

702
00:33:57.606 --> 00:33:59.913
In the middle of a performance,

703
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.429
I was injured before.

704
00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:05.717
I was in so much pain, and
they took an X-ray right away.

705
00:34:05.765 --> 00:34:09.546
What do you think the doctor said
after seeing the X-ray photo?

706
00:34:09.571 --> 00:34:10.671
I can never forget it.

707
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.530
Where were you hurt?

708
00:34:12.644 --> 00:34:14.022
(Hesitant)

709
00:34:14.038 --> 00:34:15.382
You gotta tell us where at least.

710
00:34:15.452 --> 00:34:17.194
Oh, it's part of the answer?

711
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:18.827
Yeah, I can't tell you.

712
00:34:18.858 --> 00:34:20.952
"You're so young, yet..."

713
00:34:21.045 --> 00:34:22.827
"You got joints like an
80-year-old grandma!"

714
00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:25.061
"You must've used them so much."

715
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:28.452
"It's a miracle that you can still dance."

716
00:34:28.477 --> 00:34:30.296
Completely different.

717
00:34:30.343 --> 00:34:33.788
Imagine a part of my body that
I use a lot when I dance.

718
00:34:33.866 --> 00:34:36.553
(BoA's known for moving her hips!)

719
00:34:36.578 --> 00:34:38.694
You took an X-ray of your
pelvis and the doctor went,

720
00:34:38.741 --> 00:34:41.522
"You got a step counter
built in to your hips!"

721
00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.882
(Found out for the first time in 30 years)

722
00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:45.599
"Who are you, Doctor?"

723
00:34:45.624 --> 00:34:48.436
"Oh, I'm Man-bok from Wink!" [pun]

724
00:34:48.935 --> 00:34:50.624
He was in "Ink," not "Wink."

725
00:34:50.663 --> 00:34:53.132
I laughed out loud when I heard him.

726
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.983
I was in so much pain,
I was on a wheelchair.

727
00:34:56.054 --> 00:34:57.788
I took an X-ray that way, but...

728
00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.467
Can I say it? The reason why you laughed?

729
00:35:00.507 --> 00:35:03.210
Doctor said, "BoA..."

730
00:35:03.241 --> 00:35:06.733
"You'd have a very easy time
giving birth to children later."

731
00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:08.373
See? You laughed!

732
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.921
Even snot came out.

733
00:35:10.991 --> 00:35:13.163
- Must be right!
- Yeah, because they say...

734
00:35:13.195 --> 00:35:17.710
Women with strong hips have
easier time giving birth.

735
00:35:18.173 --> 00:35:19.804
No.

736
00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:21.530
From an orthopedist, right?

737
00:35:21.554 --> 00:35:22.484
It's gotta be pelvis.

738
00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:23.780
This happened in Japan.

739
00:35:23.828 --> 00:35:25.398
It was a Japanese doctor then?

740
00:35:25.422 --> 00:35:26.945
Is pelvis correct?

741
00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:29.124
Yes, that part is right.

742
00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:31.695
With the X-ray photo...

743
00:35:31.726 --> 00:35:34.218
The doctor asked for your autograph?

744
00:35:34.802 --> 00:35:36.077
"I'm a fan!"

745
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:38.171
You're wrong.

746
00:35:38.773 --> 00:35:41.577
It was a compliment I've
never heard before.

747
00:35:42.734 --> 00:35:45.491
"Oh, BoA, your pelvis..."

748
00:35:45.508 --> 00:35:47.882
"You have a very pretty pelvis."

749
00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:51.085
(A pretty pelvis?)

750
00:35:51.526 --> 00:35:54.124
"I've never seen a prettier pelvis before!"

751
00:35:54.148 --> 00:35:56.062
That's what I said!

752
00:35:56.475 --> 00:35:59.093
"A pelvis you'd see in text books!"

753
00:35:59.556 --> 00:36:01.554
"Amazing pelvis!"

754
00:36:01.579 --> 00:36:03.359
Make your choice.

755
00:36:04.304 --> 00:36:06.077
Pretty.

756
00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:10.570
Amazing.

757
00:36:13.456 --> 00:36:16.546
I'd say "cute" like what Soo-geun said.

758
00:36:16.703 --> 00:36:19.507
"BoA, your pelvis is very..."

759
00:36:19.539 --> 00:36:21.734
"Pretty!'

760
00:36:23.245 --> 00:36:25.788
(Jang-hoon and Kyung-hoon
both get it right)

761
00:36:26.205 --> 00:36:28.648
(The dad will do a #1 ceremony)

762
00:36:31.062 --> 00:36:33.124
(While you dance!)

763
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.741
(He's been seeing Jang-hoon do the
Tetris dance alone from the back)

764
00:36:38.961 --> 00:36:41.077
I never expected him to do that!

765
00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:42.562
I've been wanting to try it.

766
00:36:42.593 --> 00:36:44.530
(Like father, like son)

767
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:46.310
The situation was that

768
00:36:46.358 --> 00:36:49.429
I was performing with high heels on.

769
00:36:49.468 --> 00:36:53.273
I had to change quickly behind a curtain.

770
00:36:53.328 --> 00:36:57.171
And my heel caught on the drape,
and my pelvis got pulled back.

771
00:36:57.226 --> 00:37:01.648
So I couldn't walk, could barely stand.

772
00:37:01.718 --> 00:37:05.398
I got back on the stage, but I
couldn't dance at all after.

773
00:37:05.461 --> 00:37:06.726
I just stood and sang.

774
00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:09.320
So I went to the hospital on a wheelchair.

775
00:37:09.366 --> 00:37:12.046
The doctor looked at my X-ray photo,

776
00:37:12.124 --> 00:37:14.179
and said this to himself almost.

777
00:37:14.204 --> 00:37:17.062
"Wow, you have a very pretty pelvis!"

778
00:37:17.093 --> 00:37:18.499
That's what he said.

779
00:37:18.524 --> 00:37:20.273
I laughed out loud at that remark.

780
00:37:20.343 --> 00:37:25.241
I wasn't trying to be funny,
but one time during a TV show,

781
00:37:25.281 --> 00:37:27.124
the floor was slippery
and I fell backwards.

782
00:37:27.172 --> 00:37:28.679
- I suffered a concussion.
- Who did?

783
00:37:28.718 --> 00:37:29.882
I did!

784
00:37:29.922 --> 00:37:32.796
I was unconscious for a few seconds.

785
00:37:32.843 --> 00:37:36.643
People were worried about me,
so I went to take an X-ray.

786
00:37:36.726 --> 00:37:39.491
The doctor said this after
seeing the X-ray photo.

787
00:37:39.515 --> 00:37:41.601
He's been a doctor for 20 years.

788
00:37:41.633 --> 00:37:44.546
He said I had the biggest
skull he's ever seen.

789
00:37:44.578 --> 00:37:46.671
It filled up the whole screen!

790
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:49.671
(Still baffled)

791
00:37:49.703 --> 00:37:52.210
It didn't even fit on the screen!

792
00:37:52.265 --> 00:37:55.030
I realized that it wasn't that I was
fat, but my skull itself is big!

793
00:37:55.077 --> 00:37:56.718
It didn't fit the screen!

794
00:37:56.743 --> 00:37:58.585
Corners were cut off.

795
00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.765
My face didn't fit.

796
00:38:00.906 --> 00:38:02.687
It was really amazing.

797
00:38:02.712 --> 00:38:03.937
So amazing!

798
00:38:04.047 --> 00:38:09.374
I heard that an industry expert in Japan
said that you'd take 10 years to get big?

799
00:38:09.422 --> 00:38:13.788
Back then, not along of singers
sang live on stage in Korea.

800
00:38:13.929 --> 00:38:18.030
I wasn't prepared to perform
on stage while singing live.

801
00:38:18.055 --> 00:38:21.750
I did a showcase in Japan, but every
singer in Japan sang live on stage.

802
00:38:21.803 --> 00:38:25.663
So for the first time ever, I
totally ruined a performance.

803
00:38:25.695 --> 00:38:28.804
I developed stage fright since then.

804
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.507
I still have that a little.

805
00:38:30.828 --> 00:38:32.679
BoA's scared to be on stage?

806
00:38:32.695 --> 00:38:34.249
It's terrible.

807
00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:38.187
It's like saying Kyung-hoon's got a
fear of singing with his head-voice.

808
00:38:38.212 --> 00:38:41.062
Or Ho-dong having a
fear of dumpling soups.

809
00:38:41.087 --> 00:38:42.773
I get it right away!

810
00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:45.499
After that failure in Japan,

811
00:38:45.547 --> 00:38:48.132
I realized that I had to become
good at it no matter what.

812
00:38:48.164 --> 00:38:49.593
So I kept practicing.

813
00:38:49.648 --> 00:38:54.132
I was really determined,
I'd sing on tread mills,

814
00:38:54.226 --> 00:38:57.679
and every dance practice. I'd sing.

815
00:38:57.851 --> 00:38:59.452
How popular were you in Japan?

816
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.757
When you were active?

817
00:39:00.781 --> 00:39:03.663
One of the things I'm sad about is that

818
00:39:03.725 --> 00:39:07.499
while I was really popular and while
things were going well for me,

819
00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:10.472
I never actually had a
moment to realize it.

820
00:39:10.497 --> 00:39:13.616
You might've been too young and busy.

821
00:39:13.828 --> 00:39:15.702
Kids these days might not know, but

822
00:39:15.734 --> 00:39:18.421
when BoA was really big,

823
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:20.945
her news weren't really on
the entertainment page.

824
00:39:21.008 --> 00:39:23.406
Her successes were shown on the front line!

825
00:39:23.468 --> 00:39:25.593
She had unprecedented level of success.

826
00:39:25.687 --> 00:39:27.945
Because she was that big of a hit?

827
00:39:29.065 --> 00:39:31.859
Yeah, she'd be on the news and
the newscaster would say,

828
00:39:31.914 --> 00:39:34.616
"BoA's done it again!"

829
00:39:34.688 --> 00:39:36.687
"Our BoA made us proud in Japan!"

830
00:39:36.735 --> 00:39:38.703
We'd hear that often on the news.

831
00:39:38.728 --> 00:39:41.757
It was very significant considering
that Japan has the second-biggest

832
00:39:41.781 --> 00:39:44.203
music market in the world.

833
00:39:44.266 --> 00:39:47.250
That was when Hikaru Utada was #1 in Japan.

834
00:39:47.313 --> 00:39:51.398
No one was able to topple
her in Japan but BoA.

835
00:39:51.485 --> 00:39:54.968
- Who?
- Itadakimasu? [Thanks for food]

836
00:39:56.218 --> 00:40:00.000
(Hikaru Utada, not Itadakimasu!)

837
00:40:02.538 --> 00:40:05.125
I'm sure she enjoyed her meal too.

838
00:40:07.774 --> 00:40:10.843
This one's about what happened on stage.

839
00:40:10.883 --> 00:40:14.078
One time, I was singing a slow
song and I broke out in tears.

840
00:40:14.103 --> 00:40:15.914
I couldn't finish the song.

841
00:40:15.953 --> 00:40:20.875
It was so touching though, the fans
finished the song for me by singing along.

842
00:40:20.938 --> 00:40:26.492
What do you think my manager
said when I got off the stage?

843
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.453
A Japanese manager?

844
00:40:28.508 --> 00:40:31.648
A Korean manager, but we were in Japan.

845
00:40:31.688 --> 00:40:33.906
She came up to you while you
were still crying and said,

846
00:40:33.945 --> 00:40:36.515
"BoA, I love you."

847
00:40:37.514 --> 00:40:39.922
You should really date someone.

848
00:40:39.977 --> 00:40:41.750
It's about time.

849
00:40:42.625 --> 00:40:45.148
You've been wanting to say "I
love you" to someone for so long?

850
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:48.070
I think Jang-hoon's suffering
from lack of affection.

851
00:40:48.149 --> 00:40:51.312
(This giant is short on affection)

852
00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:54.086
I know this for sure, I
know her manager, Eun-ha.

853
00:40:54.149 --> 00:40:56.773
She's not so warm and fuzzy.

854
00:40:56.836 --> 00:40:59.093
"You cried because you forgot the lyrics?"

855
00:40:59.117 --> 00:41:00.781
No!

856
00:41:00.977 --> 00:41:03.945
She is my drinking buddy,
best friend, and a manager.

857
00:41:04.016 --> 00:41:06.820
Act it out, come down stage as you cry.

858
00:41:06.903 --> 00:41:08.437
Walk over there?

859
00:41:10.778 --> 00:41:12.378
Stop!

860
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.360
(The end)

861
00:41:14.594 --> 00:41:16.382
(That was all?)

862
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.620
(Yeah, that was all)

863
00:41:19.259 --> 00:41:22.375
Who says it's still Kang Ho-dong's era?

864
00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:25.195
I really looked forward
to your answer right now.

865
00:41:25.924 --> 00:41:28.023
I was looking forward to it too!

866
00:41:29.984 --> 00:41:32.609
It was my 10th anniversary concert.

867
00:41:32.679 --> 00:41:35.609
The last song of the
concert was "Merr-Chri."

868
00:41:35.687 --> 00:41:41.039
It was released in Japan over 13 years ago,

869
00:41:41.078 --> 00:41:44.625
but it's still played
every Christmas season.

870
00:41:44.672 --> 00:41:48.656
I still sing it in Japan at awards shows.

871
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.218
As soon as I started singing the
song, I thought of my past 10 years.

872
00:41:54.258 --> 00:41:56.609
I saw those moments like a movie scene.

873
00:41:56.617 --> 00:41:58.726
I was so sad.

874
00:41:58.891 --> 00:42:03.211
And I couldn't sing the song, and
my fans sang the song for me there.

875
00:42:03.297 --> 00:42:07.117
I've never heard Japanese
audience sing that loudly before.

876
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.312
"BoA, your fans are
better singers than you!"

877
00:42:10.337 --> 00:42:11.851
That would've been better.

878
00:42:11.882 --> 00:42:13.773
- It was harsher?
- Yeah.

879
00:42:13.938 --> 00:42:17.023
The fans sang the song till the end.

880
00:42:17.062 --> 00:42:22.445
I was so thankful and moved,
and came down the stage.

881
00:42:24.953 --> 00:42:29.570
"Hey BoA, you got paid for
not doing any work at all!"

882
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.562
"A professional should
finish singing on stage."

883
00:42:32.617 --> 00:42:35.422
"How could you cry and not finish?"

884
00:42:35.445 --> 00:42:37.554
It wasn't that long, just a short phrase.

885
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.211
She said this to me while she
was also wiping away her tears.

886
00:42:41.314 --> 00:42:43.234
"This is a broadcasting accident!"

887
00:42:43.266 --> 00:42:44.281
Not it.

888
00:42:45.477 --> 00:42:48.554
"BoA, let's record the song
again in this version!"

889
00:42:48.633 --> 00:42:49.492
No.

890
00:42:49.563 --> 00:42:50.953
"Let's publish it."

891
00:42:50.969 --> 00:42:52.289
- DVD?
- Yeah, DVD.

892
00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:55.836
That comes out after every concert,
we were filming that day too.

893
00:42:55.961 --> 00:42:58.172
"BoA, you should've finished."

894
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.797
You're close!

895
00:43:01.022 --> 00:43:03.625
"BoA, that felt great! Do an encore!"

896
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.336
It wasn't quite an encore.

897
00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:06.617
Not an encore.

898
00:43:06.656 --> 00:43:09.539
But Ho-dong was very close.

899
00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.539
"Let's do another slow song!"

900
00:43:12.641 --> 00:43:14.241
"BoA, do it again."

901
00:43:15.266 --> 00:43:17.047
Sang-min's got it!

902
00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.929
"Go on stage again!"

903
00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:21.648
"BoA, let's sing that one again."

904
00:43:21.945 --> 00:43:25.047
"We're filming for your DVD today,
we can't use this version."

905
00:43:25.078 --> 00:43:27.297
"Go up and sing it properly,
and we'll use that take."

906
00:43:27.352 --> 00:43:30.078
She would say that! That's her style.

907
00:43:30.103 --> 00:43:32.304
(In disbelief)

908
00:43:34.169 --> 00:43:36.711
What's funny is that she
was crying herself, too.

909
00:43:36.765 --> 00:43:39.351
Her eyes were all red but said,

910
00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:42.226
"We can't use this version,
go and sing again."

911
00:43:42.289 --> 00:43:43.929
She was still thinking with reason!

912
00:43:43.977 --> 00:43:46.007
So what happened after was that...

913
00:43:46.024 --> 00:43:48.023
She had to keep her cool.

914
00:43:48.055 --> 00:43:50.140
I said, "What?"

915
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:55.195
(She was trying not to explode in anger)

916
00:43:55.343 --> 00:43:58.968
I'd say it's a more valuable take.

917
00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:00.562
Listen to me, Jang-hoon!

918
00:44:00.578 --> 00:44:02.178
Sorry.

919
00:44:02.955 --> 00:44:05.851
I thought you were done after that noise.

920
00:44:06.281 --> 00:44:09.461
I grabbed the mic and went up on
stage again while I was still mad.

921
00:44:09.485 --> 00:44:11.265
I went up on stage and told the audience,

922
00:44:11.305 --> 00:44:13.093
"My manager's making me
sing because of the DVD..."

923
00:44:13.133 --> 00:44:14.757
You told on her?

924
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.664
You're scary too!

925
00:44:16.689 --> 00:44:18.336
(The two won't lose to each other)

926
00:44:18.383 --> 00:44:21.586
But they're still really good friends!
The best of friends.

927
00:44:22.437 --> 00:44:24.890
So I finally sang the song
properly until the end.

928
00:44:24.906 --> 00:44:27.125
I'm sure they were even
more moved to see that.

929
00:44:27.156 --> 00:44:29.961
They did like it, they
got to hear it again.

930
00:44:29.977 --> 00:44:32.172
It was a very happy moment.

931
00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:35.570
Then a few months later, I was
given the DVD of that concert.

932
00:44:35.586 --> 00:44:37.398
The finished product.

933
00:44:37.594 --> 00:44:40.515
Finally, "Merry-Chri" was coming on.

934
00:44:40.617 --> 00:44:42.968
And the girl in the DVD is crying!

935
00:44:42.993 --> 00:44:45.179
They must've liked that moment!

936
00:44:45.946 --> 00:44:48.843
And it showed the whole
song that I was crying on.

937
00:44:48.891 --> 00:44:50.922
Then comes a bonus material!

938
00:44:50.961 --> 00:44:53.228
My second take on the song was it!

939
00:44:53.684 --> 00:44:57.461
("Merry-Chri" performance of
her 10th anniversary concert)

940
00:45:04.701 --> 00:45:07.898
(She thought of her memories
from the past 10 years)

941
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.132
(She couldn't stop crying
because she was so emotional)

942
00:45:13.292 --> 00:45:17.664
(The fans started to lift up
their voices to sing for her)

943
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.375
Thank you very much everyone!

944
00:45:28.015 --> 00:45:31.273
(BoA exits the stage after this
happy moment shared with her fans)

945
00:45:31.392 --> 00:45:34.445
(But the video continues on)

946
00:45:34.649 --> 00:45:36.812
(A moment later...)

947
00:45:36.906 --> 00:45:39.570
(She comes on stage again
at her fans' cheers)

948
00:45:40.484 --> 00:45:43.179
(This DVD ended up with both versions!)

949
00:45:43.767 --> 00:45:45.726
She had a big picture planned!

950
00:45:45.774 --> 00:45:46.992
How smart of her!

951
00:45:47.031 --> 00:45:48.812
Nothing was taken out!

952
00:45:48.898 --> 00:45:50.498
She's really smart.

953
00:45:50.711 --> 00:45:53.289
How should I say it...
I was really moved.

954
00:45:53.297 --> 00:45:55.039
And I was very grateful.

955
00:45:55.602 --> 00:45:57.648
That's what I was feeling.

956
00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.297
I was thinking about how
happy I was at the moment.

957
00:46:00.336 --> 00:46:03.578
And she totally destroyed with her words.

958
00:46:03.609 --> 00:46:05.156
That's what made me sad.

959
00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:08.195
I think it's because you
didn't cry hard enough.

960
00:46:11.172 --> 00:46:14.687
If you were ripping up your clothes
and were bawling in the waiting room

961
00:46:14.719 --> 00:46:16.836
no one could've made you do it again!

962
00:46:16.906 --> 00:46:18.406
That's true.

963
00:46:19.084 --> 00:46:21.382
It's hard for a human being to say that.

964
00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:24.031
He's so good at breaking up emotions.

965
00:46:25.148 --> 00:46:29.578
I'll make sure bawl even harder,
fiercely and passionately.

966
00:46:29.602 --> 00:46:31.226
They're total best friends.

967
00:46:31.297 --> 00:46:33.390
I can see why she's been so
popular all these years.

968
00:46:33.415 --> 00:46:35.367
She did go up on stage in that situation.

969
00:46:35.383 --> 00:46:37.351
Yeah, she did sing the song again.

970
00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:38.601
Most wouldn't be able to.

971
00:46:38.649 --> 00:46:40.984
The producer would of
course ask her to go again.

972
00:46:41.008 --> 00:46:43.281
"Give it another try."

973
00:46:43.906 --> 00:46:47.328
But a lot of times, if a
singer is famous enough,

974
00:46:47.375 --> 00:46:49.836
would say, "Why would I,"
and not do it again.

975
00:46:49.899 --> 00:46:53.406
The reason I'm best friends with her is

976
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.297
that she did tell me something so cold.

977
00:46:55.328 --> 00:46:58.968
And I sang the song again
while being upset.

978
00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:01.031
But after the song, she was like...

979
00:47:01.056 --> 00:47:04.734
"My princess, you did such a great job!"

980
00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:07.164
I couldn't get mad at her
when she was smiling so big!

981
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.320
She's sane though, right?

982
00:47:12.297 --> 00:47:14.742
- So that's why...
- She's really amazing.

983
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:15.875
I feel like I was being trained.

984
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.343
How about we hook her up with Jang-hoon?

985
00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:20.398
She's cold-hearted too!
How about with Jang-hoon?

986
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.953
- Is she married?
- She's not.

987
00:47:22.016 --> 00:47:23.664
Should we hook them up?

988
00:47:23.711 --> 00:47:25.562
Isn't she much older then?

989
00:47:25.586 --> 00:47:27.390
No, she was born in 1976.

990
00:47:28.563 --> 00:47:30.539
If she's like that...

991
00:47:30.555 --> 00:47:33.593
I think, though Jang-hoon's retired now,

992
00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:36.351
she might make him play basketball again.

993
00:47:37.851 --> 00:47:40.125
(Wiping away his tears when he retired)

994
00:47:40.156 --> 00:47:41.937
("Let's do it again!")

995
00:47:41.962 --> 00:47:43.562
You should meet her up!

996
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:46.664
(She might bring him back on the court)

997
00:47:47.073 --> 00:47:49.429
(BoA's questions are done here)

998
00:47:49.727 --> 00:47:52.531
Sang-yeub, it's your last question now.

999
00:47:52.996 --> 00:47:54.742
(In a hurry)

1000
00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:57.234
This time, give us the answer.

1001
00:47:57.258 --> 00:47:58.828
Then we'll guess the question.

1002
00:47:58.882 --> 00:48:00.664
(What a fresh idea!)

1003
00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:04.773
That's creative, right?
It'll make you a star!

1004
00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.531
It is a creative idea.

1005
00:48:09.852 --> 00:48:13.375
This was while I was shooting "Give
Love Away," a weekend TV series.

1006
00:48:13.399 --> 00:48:16.351
Park Geun-hyung was my father in the drama.

1007
00:48:16.405 --> 00:48:21.297
Because of him, I got to think
really seriously about acting.

1008
00:48:21.328 --> 00:48:25.982
But he did something specific
for me to think that.

1009
00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:26.898
What do you think he did?

1010
00:48:26.914 --> 00:48:31.297
He did something to change
Sang-yeub into a true actor?

1011
00:48:31.344 --> 00:48:35.328
Yes, it was a pivotal point for me.

1012
00:48:35.391 --> 00:48:39.937
You went to see him in the
waiting room during break time.

1013
00:48:39.977 --> 00:48:44.250
And you found him going over the
script even during break time.

1014
00:48:44.726 --> 00:48:46.273
That's not the answer, but

1015
00:48:46.328 --> 00:48:48.070
he really did do that.

1016
00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:49.562
He seems the type.

1017
00:48:49.602 --> 00:48:51.437
What kind of a scene was it?

1018
00:48:51.462 --> 00:48:53.015
My girlfriend had dumped me.

1019
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.070
I got home drunk in the scene.

1020
00:48:55.086 --> 00:48:58.507
I opened the door and I'm
about to argue with him.

1021
00:48:59.832 --> 00:49:03.330
He did this when I was lost and
couldn't get a hold of my emotions.

1022
00:49:03.355 --> 00:49:08.574
It wasn't in the scripts, but he acted
like your real father and slapped you.

1023
00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:11.471
It's similar, but the
location is different.

1024
00:49:11.496 --> 00:49:12.765
Remember it's, Park Geun-hyung.

1025
00:49:12.855 --> 00:49:17.859
He put all his strength into and said, "Get
it right!" and punched you in the stomach.

1026
00:49:18.957 --> 00:49:21.980
- I got it.
- No, it's my turn. I'm sure of this.

1027
00:49:22.254 --> 00:49:25.113
- Let's pretend I'm Park
Geun-hyung. Start acting. - Okay.

1028
00:49:25.183 --> 00:49:27.227
Can't you get a hold of yourself?

1029
00:49:27.252 --> 00:49:29.620
Can't you get a hold of yourself?

1030
00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:35.093
Wait a second, you try and play the part.
Play your part again.

1031
00:49:35.308 --> 00:49:36.738
Get ready! Stand-by!

1032
00:49:36.769 --> 00:49:40.113
- Are you ready? - Yeah.
- Ready! Stand-by!

1033
00:49:40.512 --> 00:49:42.409
Where did you drink so much?

1034
00:49:42.465 --> 00:49:44.503
What's it to you, father?

1035
00:49:45.019 --> 00:49:46.811
What's it to you, father?

1036
00:49:47.658 --> 00:49:50.378
(Park Geun-hyung gets mad and
start kicking 360 degrees)

1037
00:49:50.403 --> 00:49:52.534
(His passion for acting doesn't end)

1038
00:49:53.134 --> 00:49:55.268
(The love for Sang-yeob is over-whelming)

1039
00:49:55.293 --> 00:49:57.202
What do you mean, "What's it to me?".

1040
00:49:57.227 --> 00:50:01.284
It would've been funny if Park
Geun-hyung acted like that father.

1041
00:50:02.847 --> 00:50:04.854
- I'm dizzy.
- I bet you're dizzy.

1042
00:50:05.082 --> 00:50:08.863
He knew if he did something, it would
finally make my emotions comes through.

1043
00:50:08.988 --> 00:50:10.541
- A knock on the head!
- No.

1044
00:50:10.566 --> 00:50:11.814
Where did he hit you?

1045
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.026
He told me to try harder. I think
Ho-dong might do this a lot.

1046
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:19.402
- I got it! - I think Sang-yeob's answers
are simple. He hit you on your back.

1047
00:50:19.457 --> 00:50:21.144
- That's what I thought.
- You got it!

1048
00:50:21.169 --> 00:50:22.793
You see? I told you!

1049
00:50:22.818 --> 00:50:24.369
Was the question too hard?

1050
00:50:24.394 --> 00:50:26.971
- No, everyone knew the answer.
- Everyone knew already?

1051
00:50:26.996 --> 00:50:31.199
Did he hit you on the back, rub
your back or pat you on the back?

1052
00:50:31.543 --> 00:50:35.480
Park Geun-hyung and I were
talking about the scene and...

1053
00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:39.948
I was about to go back to my area
when he said, "You can do better".

1054
00:50:40.215 --> 00:50:44.448
It was so moving when he slapped me
on my back. I'm getting teary now.

1055
00:50:44.472 --> 00:50:46.183
I became very emotional.

1056
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.605
I was only supposed to cry a little bit.

1057
00:50:48.949 --> 00:50:52.472
I was crying so much I
couldn't say my lines.

1058
00:50:52.972 --> 00:50:56.605
His gesture made me let go of
my emotions when I was acting.

1059
00:50:56.918 --> 00:51:00.018
I'm sure Park Geun-hyung hit
you because he was mad.

1060
00:51:00.043 --> 00:51:02.456
- He was frustrated with your acting.
- I won't disagree.

1061
00:51:02.582 --> 00:51:04.245
You kept messing up your lines.

1062
00:51:04.269 --> 00:51:07.550
- He wasn't going to let you get away
with it. - Did it help your acting?

1063
00:51:07.707 --> 00:51:10.975
- It totally helped.
- That's why I keep hitting you.

1064
00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.689
(He finally realizes Ho-dong sincerity)

1065
00:51:13.832 --> 00:51:16.589
(Soo-geun receives an abundance
of love from Ho-dong)

1066
00:51:16.793 --> 00:51:19.268
When he was on "Grandpas Over Flowers"...

1067
00:51:19.293 --> 00:51:21.929
he went to go buy uniforms
from soccer teams.

1068
00:51:21.954 --> 00:51:24.796
He said, "This is for
my son and this one is...

1069
00:51:24.821 --> 00:51:27.473
for my other son on our
drama, Sang-yeob".

1070
00:51:28.402 --> 00:51:31.561
This one is for my son on
our drama, Lee Sang-yeob.

1071
00:51:31.785 --> 00:51:34.917
This one is for my youngest
son, Park Sang-won.

1072
00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:37.830
- A son and daughter?
- No, both of them are my sons.

1073
00:51:37.855 --> 00:51:41.683
He bought both uniforms and gave
one to his son and gave one to me.

1074
00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:45.058
He's good about taking
care of his junior actors.

1075
00:51:45.129 --> 00:51:49.152
He did a drama with Dong-hae and
he's still very close to Dong-hae.

1076
00:51:49.316 --> 00:51:51.995
He even came to Super
Junior's concerts as well.

1077
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.777
- He's so cool.
- He's really cool.

1078
00:51:53.879 --> 00:51:58.409
- He's always been great. - He dances
"Sorry, Sorry, Sorry" better than us.

1079
00:52:01.332 --> 00:52:03.886
- I think I went too far.
- Yes, I think so.

1080
00:52:05.496 --> 00:52:08.042
As you all know, Boa and
I acted in the drama...

1081
00:52:08.067 --> 00:52:11.324
"My Wife is Having an
Affair This Week".

1082
00:52:11.637 --> 00:52:16.863
Sung-gyun and I were taken aback
because of what Boa did on the drama.

1083
00:52:17.472 --> 00:52:18.791
- Why?
- Why do you think?

1084
00:52:18.816 --> 00:52:21.213
Why were we taken aback because of Boa?

1085
00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.847
She was still hungover
from the previous day?

1086
00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.862
- It has something to do with that.
- Just as we thought, it involved alcohol.

1087
00:52:28.176 --> 00:52:29.526
It's got something to do with that.

1088
00:52:29.551 --> 00:52:33.839
They're all seniors and older than Boa,
but when she was on her way home...

1089
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:36.658
she gave out $100 allowances to them.

1090
00:52:36.683 --> 00:52:38.850
Here you go, use it for your taxi fare.

1091
00:52:39.104 --> 00:52:41.612
- She was drunk. - $100 for everyone.
- No way.

1092
00:52:41.637 --> 00:52:43.260
It happened while she was acting.

1093
00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:45.581
It naturally happened while we were acting.

1094
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.136
I got it! Boa had to act
like she was drunk.

1095
00:52:49.824 --> 00:52:51.933
But she was really drunk.

1096
00:52:52.105 --> 00:52:54.128
I agree with that answer.

1097
00:52:54.347 --> 00:52:57.642
We were taken aback by what she
did while she acted drunk.

1098
00:52:57.667 --> 00:53:01.526
I'm acting. "All of you guys can
go to hell! Get out of my face!"

1099
00:53:02.004 --> 00:53:03.093
Cut!

1100
00:53:03.769 --> 00:53:07.706
"Why are you cutting the scene? Who
the hell are you to yell, 'Cut'?"

1101
00:53:08.902 --> 00:53:11.105
- "Who are you?"
- The scene is over.

1102
00:53:11.246 --> 00:53:13.363
"I'm not done yet, boy!"

1103
00:53:14.199 --> 00:53:17.964
- "Why are you cutting when I'm finally
into it?". - That's what she said.

1104
00:53:18.183 --> 00:53:20.612
All the managers had to come in.

1105
00:53:20.637 --> 00:53:25.878
Boa's manager said, "She's too drunk.
Try the scene when she's sober".

1106
00:53:25.941 --> 00:53:28.738
But they used the scene when she's drunk.

1107
00:53:29.715 --> 00:53:32.760
She tried acting like a fool
during her drunk scene.

1108
00:53:32.785 --> 00:53:34.323
She was too passionate about her acting.

1109
00:53:34.347 --> 00:53:36.890
What was her character's personality like?

1110
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:41.140
She's a very smart and
uptight divorcee.

1111
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.261
She's a divorcee?

1112
00:53:44.699 --> 00:53:47.898
- A divorcee?
- How did you ever play that character?

1113
00:53:48.144 --> 00:53:49.374
A divorcee!

1114
00:53:51.535 --> 00:53:54.667
I'm going to look over to him
every time you look at me.

1115
00:53:55.129 --> 00:53:58.007
You guys have let him off
too easily these days.

1116
00:53:58.429 --> 00:54:04.003
The character goes and gets drunk, but
comes out of the bar onto a grassy field.

1117
00:54:04.199 --> 00:54:05.554
I got it!

1118
00:54:05.707 --> 00:54:08.835
People were passing by and they
said, "Look, it's Boa" and...

1119
00:54:08.844 --> 00:54:11.682
she yelled back, "What
are you looking at?".

1120
00:54:11.707 --> 00:54:12.707
No, no.

1121
00:54:12.824 --> 00:54:17.511
You were taken aback because of something
I did that wasn't in the script, right?

1122
00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:22.566
She began hitting you guys and
ripping your hair from your head.

1123
00:54:22.722 --> 00:54:24.257
No, no. You're wrong.

1124
00:54:24.504 --> 00:54:26.195
Did she start eating the grass?

1125
00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:30.534
"Let's make green onion pancakes
and eat it since we're drunk".

1126
00:54:30.613 --> 00:54:33.425
- No, no.
- She started to lay down on the grass.

1127
00:54:33.902 --> 00:54:37.158
It wasn't in the script, but
she kept rolling in the grass.

1128
00:54:37.183 --> 00:54:38.886
- You're really close.
- Really?

1129
00:54:38.996 --> 00:54:41.292
Can't you just say that I got it right?

1130
00:54:41.379 --> 00:54:43.425
What did she do on the grass?

1131
00:54:43.769 --> 00:54:45.988
She began taking off her clothes.

1132
00:54:46.074 --> 00:54:48.503
- Not her clothes.
- Her shoes! She took off her shoes.

1133
00:54:48.605 --> 00:54:52.072
- Her shoes. She took off her socks too.
- You got it, Yeong-cheol.

1134
00:54:52.097 --> 00:54:55.261
She took off her socks too. I
believe her socks were the answer.

1135
00:54:55.457 --> 00:54:58.456
Anyone can guess her shoes.
It was her socks. Socks.

1136
00:54:59.246 --> 00:55:01.417
Wait a second. This is so upsetting.

1137
00:55:01.472 --> 00:55:03.924
I'm the one, who guessed she
rolled around the grass.

1138
00:55:03.949 --> 00:55:07.409
- You paved the way for him.
- I even guessed she took off her shoes.

1139
00:55:07.519 --> 00:55:11.526
You need to get the exact word correctly.
It can't be that hard!

1140
00:55:11.551 --> 00:55:14.074
You assisted the best in Korea.

1141
00:55:14.496 --> 00:55:18.527
- Let's move on. - I've always been
the one to put points on the board.

1142
00:55:18.879 --> 00:55:22.120
She was supposed to act drunk and we
were okay with her rolling in the grass.

1143
00:55:22.144 --> 00:55:24.010
We were okay with her taking
off her shoes as well.

1144
00:55:24.035 --> 00:55:26.440
Suddenly, she began taking off her socks.

1145
00:55:26.465 --> 00:55:29.867
- She drank too much.
- Hey, hey! What are you doing?

1146
00:55:30.387 --> 00:55:32.808
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

1147
00:55:32.879 --> 00:55:36.488
- There's people watching you.
- Get up!, you need to get up!

1148
00:55:37.097 --> 00:55:38.460
You scared me!

1149
00:55:38.691 --> 00:55:40.257
You really scared me.

1150
00:55:41.027 --> 00:55:43.916
- You're driving me crazy.
- Why are you taking off your socks?

1151
00:55:43.941 --> 00:55:46.816
- Put it back on.
- Put it in the laundry basket.

1152
00:55:47.691 --> 00:55:49.011
What the heck?

1153
00:55:49.238 --> 00:55:51.635
Were you making up the part
by taking your socks off?

1154
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:56.159
I made it up on the spot. I had to show,
I was so drunk I thought I was at home.

1155
00:55:56.222 --> 00:55:58.979
I guess you can look back at your
acting by looking back at yourself.

1156
00:55:59.004 --> 00:56:02.152
- You came on our drama as a cameo.
- Wow.

1157
00:56:02.691 --> 00:56:06.253
How detailed was his acting and
did he study for his role?

1158
00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:08.487
He had to turn and look at me in the scene.

1159
00:56:08.512 --> 00:56:13.245
I was supposed to run full-force
at him and turn him around.

1160
00:56:13.722 --> 00:56:16.706
He had to do his look that he always
does when he looks at you. This one.

1161
00:56:16.847 --> 00:56:18.402
Something like this.

1162
00:56:18.504 --> 00:56:21.283
- I was looking right at him and...
- I can imagine it right now.

1163
00:56:21.308 --> 00:56:24.441
I was so surprised. I was only
supposed to say, "You surprised me".

1164
00:56:24.535 --> 00:56:26.627
But instead, I said, "Damn!
You surprised me!".

1165
00:56:26.652 --> 00:56:28.260
It came out naturally.

1166
00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:31.291
It wasn't like regular people
when he grabbed onto my shirt.

1167
00:56:31.316 --> 00:56:34.359
My shirt went up so high,
I was showing my belly.

1168
00:56:35.527 --> 00:56:39.402
It almost felt like he was
lifting me up from my belly.

1169
00:56:39.512 --> 00:56:43.972
Once I felt like that, I didn't know
I was yelling, "Save me! Save me!".

1170
00:56:45.018 --> 00:56:48.683
(He faces off with the man his
wife is having an affair with)

1171
00:56:49.259 --> 00:56:50.273
You scared me!

1172
00:56:50.398 --> 00:56:51.499
(Freaked out)

1173
00:56:51.801 --> 00:56:53.031
Who are you?

1174
00:56:53.363 --> 00:56:54.960
You wanna' fight me?

1175
00:56:55.402 --> 00:56:57.791
- You wanna' fight me?
- Save... Save me.

1176
00:56:57.816 --> 00:56:59.253
It was so fun.

1177
00:56:59.652 --> 00:57:02.980
- He wasn't nervous at all.
- He didn't make any mistakes?

1178
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:06.635
He didn't make any mistakes, but
I was moved by what he did.

1179
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:11.699
He did a great job, but he kept asking,
"Should we try again? Let's go again".

1180
00:57:13.426 --> 00:57:15.699
- Let's try that again.
- Why?

1181
00:57:16.324 --> 00:57:18.339
I don't like what I did.

1182
00:57:18.504 --> 00:57:20.628
I didn't have many lines.

1183
00:57:21.902 --> 00:57:25.769
Shouldn't I have more lines since
I began my career in dramas?

1184
00:57:26.081 --> 00:57:28.058
He's telling us a moving story.

1185
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.714
Do you think he can keep acting?

1186
00:57:30.863 --> 00:57:34.479
I'm looking forward to Ma Dong-seok
and Ho-dong in a shot together.

1187
00:57:34.504 --> 00:57:37.277
You could be like Jang
Chen from "The Outlaws".

1188
00:57:37.426 --> 00:57:39.080
You can be on "The Outlaws II".

1189
00:57:39.105 --> 00:57:41.972
- He could be Jang Chen!
- Yeah, Dong Chen.

1190
00:57:42.355 --> 00:57:45.166
- You'd be the new gangster boss.
- Dong Chen.

1191
00:57:45.191 --> 00:57:47.339
Did you come here by yourself?

1192
00:57:47.738 --> 00:57:49.189
Did you come here by yourself?

1193
00:57:49.323 --> 00:57:53.034
Are you Ma Dong-seok? Wanna' come
over and hang out over here?

1194
00:57:53.207 --> 00:57:54.704
Hang out here?

1195
00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:57.816
Hey, you! I'll be waiting for you here!

1196
00:57:58.347 --> 00:57:59.831
I'm waiting, right here.

1197
00:57:59.972 --> 00:58:02.269
Let's go, me and you! One-on-one.

1198
00:58:02.465 --> 00:58:04.673
He looks like he can play the part.

1199
00:58:04.926 --> 00:58:06.063
Good job, Sang-yeob!

1200
00:58:06.088 --> 00:58:08.689
(We'll look forward to Ma Dong-seok
and Kang Ho-dong's "The Outlaws 2")

1201
00:58:08.714 --> 00:58:11.821
(Are you still looking for your true love?)

1202
00:58:12.251 --> 00:58:14.493
(We'll find your true love today)

1203
00:58:14.687 --> 00:58:17.059
(Let's get married)

1204
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:21.684
(Let's look for your one
and only love here)

1205
00:58:22.965 --> 00:58:26.017
- Seriously?
- What the heck? Why aren't there any guys?

1206
00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:28.926
How come guys are so rude?
Do you know what time it is?

1207
00:58:28.951 --> 00:58:32.027
- How come we're here first?
- I think our seats are here. - There?

1208
00:58:32.105 --> 00:58:35.025
- There's three seats here. Do you want
dried squid? - Yeah, it looks good.

1209
00:58:35.051 --> 00:58:37.550
I was Miss Squid of Ulsan.

1210
00:58:37.832 --> 00:58:39.477
Doesn't it look good on me?

1211
00:58:39.519 --> 00:58:43.111
I need to find my true love. Do you
think I'll find him? I hope so.

1212
00:58:43.137 --> 00:58:44.682
I heard this place was famous.

1213
00:58:44.707 --> 00:58:49.159
You guys are bringing down the quality
here. You guys are really ugly.

1214
00:58:49.379 --> 00:58:52.088
You're uglier. What's with
your country-bumpkin outfit?

1215
00:58:52.113 --> 00:58:54.869
What are you talking about? Why
do you think you're prettier?

1216
00:58:54.894 --> 00:58:56.978
Didn't you guys see "Hyo-ri's Home Stay"?

1217
00:58:57.004 --> 00:58:59.885
- Why? What's on the show?
- I'm IU's little sister.

1218
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:02.183
- What's your name?
- Ahni U.

1219
00:59:03.051 --> 00:59:07.915
Yeah, right. Wait a second. Why are you
copying me, wearing black and white?

1220
00:59:08.597 --> 00:59:11.230
- I'm so upset.
- You're copying me, aren't you?

1221
00:59:11.379 --> 00:59:13.135
You're the one, who copied me.

1222
00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.292
This place must be losing
its touch as well.

1223
00:59:16.465 --> 00:59:18.518
There isn't another place
like this in the world.

1224
00:59:18.543 --> 00:59:21.159
- Is this where we're supposed to be?
- Yeah.

1225
00:59:21.183 --> 00:59:23.236
Isn't this the place we're
supposed to meet them?

1226
00:59:23.262 --> 00:59:26.340
- My goodness!
- Are you guys the ladies we're meeting?

1227
00:59:26.637 --> 00:59:30.020
- Those four are pretty good-looking.
- Is that Kevin?

1228
00:59:30.207 --> 00:59:32.644
What's with that giant?

1229
00:59:33.964 --> 00:59:35.481
What's he doing?

1230
00:59:35.816 --> 00:59:37.403
He smells a bit odd.

1231
00:59:38.683 --> 00:59:41.846
- Is this a horror movie?
- You're too much. - It's "Misery"!

1232
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:46.441
(You leave me after
waking me up from sleep)

1233
00:59:47.456 --> 00:59:49.753
- You're too much.
- It's "Misery"!

1234
00:59:49.918 --> 00:59:50.918
My gosh!

1235
00:59:51.816 --> 00:59:55.025
How can you spray water at me
when you've never met me before!

1236
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:56.822
I mistook you for a real flower.

1237
00:59:56.847 --> 01:00:00.908
- Don't water me, I might grow taller.
- Stop, you're getting the squid wet.

1238
01:00:00.933 --> 01:00:02.916
Is this where we're supposed to be seating?

1239
01:00:02.941 --> 01:00:05.839
You shouldn't fight when
it's a beautiful day.

1240
01:00:06.582 --> 01:00:10.825
It's such a cold day that even angels
in heaven might catch a cold. Ah-choo.

1241
01:00:10.957 --> 01:00:14.605
I came to meet a woman, who will
warm my heart like citron tea.

1242
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:19.347
- Did he get that hat transplanted on
his head? - Where? Where could you be?

1243
01:00:19.754 --> 01:00:23.760
- Where are you? - That's the worst
line I've ever heard. You're the worst!

1244
01:00:23.785 --> 01:00:26.823
How can this part of your
face be bigger than your hat?

1245
01:00:26.847 --> 01:00:31.300
- You're so witty. - How come his chin
is up there instead of down here?

1246
01:00:31.551 --> 01:00:34.129
- That was witty.
- Do you want me to come up...

1247
01:00:34.154 --> 01:00:36.790
with more reasons to
make you disappear?

1248
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.628
- What the heck? - I thought we're here for
match-making? Why aren't we starting?

1249
01:00:41.644 --> 01:00:43.847
I'm glad you're here, welcome.

1250
01:00:44.347 --> 01:00:46.541
- Let's get married!
- The emcee is here.

1251
01:00:46.566 --> 01:00:47.566
There's the emcee.

1252
01:00:47.629 --> 01:00:49.678
I truly welcome everyone
to the world's greatest...

1253
01:00:49.703 --> 01:00:52.501
match-making company,
Let's get married.

1254
01:00:52.722 --> 01:00:55.018
Welcome to our special
couple-making project...

1255
01:00:55.127 --> 01:00:58.100
where good-looking men and
women find each other.

1256
01:00:58.347 --> 01:01:00.472
I sincerely welcome you.
You're really beautiful.

1257
01:01:00.613 --> 01:01:02.199
Thank you very much.

1258
01:01:02.308 --> 01:01:04.659
I'm looking forward to this.

1259
01:01:06.519 --> 01:01:07.519
Stop staring.

1260
01:01:08.019 --> 01:01:10.800
He's just trying to break the ice.

1261
01:01:11.238 --> 01:01:16.144
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
success rate of 99% at our company.

1262
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:18.588
Jang Dong-gun and Ko
So-young also met here.

1263
01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:20.713
- They met here?
- I can't believe it.

1264
01:01:20.738 --> 01:01:25.347
Awhile back, Song Joong-ki and Song
Hae-gyo were married here as well.

1265
01:01:25.386 --> 01:01:27.472
- They met here?
- Yes, they all did.

1266
01:01:27.933 --> 01:01:30.331
Everyone famous met here.

1267
01:01:30.637 --> 01:01:32.448
- That's great!
- I'm glad I came today.

1268
01:01:32.473 --> 01:01:35.802
- Our success rate is 99%. You can
see we're almost perfect. - Yes!

1269
01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:38.988
- Excuse me! You have a 99% success rate?
- Yes.

1270
01:01:39.121 --> 01:01:40.839
Who was that 1%?

1271
01:01:42.488 --> 01:01:46.347
We had a very tall person by
the name of Seo something.

1272
01:01:48.379 --> 01:01:54.777
Unfortunately, that dishonorable act was
one of our company's biggest downfall.

1273
01:01:54.941 --> 01:01:56.761
We can't seem to get over that.

1274
01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:59.620
We thought he would've been perfect.

1275
01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:03.933
When are you going to start matching us up?

1276
01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:08.152
Our company's best-looking
singles are gathered together...

1277
01:02:08.535 --> 01:02:10.613
for the first... Never mind.

1278
01:02:14.129 --> 01:02:17.878
You hurt my pride but your
reaction was too funny.

1279
01:02:18.019 --> 01:02:22.253
It might be burdensome to use our real
names, so let's write down our nicknames.

1280
01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:25.596
- It is burdensome. - We all have
different careers and personalities.

1281
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:29.972
Write down your nicknames and
place the sticker on your chest.

1282
01:02:30.363 --> 01:02:33.752
Could you please write your
nickname on the sticker?

1283
01:02:33.777 --> 01:02:37.499
He's the only one, who keeps
trying to use method acting.

1284
01:02:38.566 --> 01:02:41.143
- Write your nick names down.
- You must be nervous.

1285
01:02:41.168 --> 01:02:42.480
Is this your first-time?

1286
01:02:42.505 --> 01:02:46.144
I heard this place was famous,
I'm so glad I came today.

1287
01:02:48.495 --> 01:02:52.096
Please write down a nickname
that you'd like to be called.

1288
01:02:52.121 --> 01:02:55.851
You get extra brownie points
for sticking it on your skin.

1289
01:02:57.222 --> 01:02:58.222
I'm all done.

1290
01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.753
- May I take this pen?
- Yes, you may.

1291
01:03:01.785 --> 01:03:04.916
- What character is he playing?
- He's distracting me.

1292
01:03:04.941 --> 01:03:07.769
He's way into his character right now.

1293
01:03:09.058 --> 01:03:11.699
Will you start announcing your nicknames?

1294
01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:16.316
My name is easy it's Won Shin. It
means I've always been a poet.

1295
01:03:17.129 --> 01:03:20.949
You've always been a poet! I heard
you recently eat books now.

1296
01:03:21.754 --> 01:03:26.800
- You're so funny. - He's very strong
and he has a lot of best-sellers.

1297
01:03:26.933 --> 01:03:29.277
I have something to tell everyone.

1298
01:03:29.543 --> 01:03:30.543
I've...

1299
01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:32.238
actually...

1300
01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:34.299
been married before.

1301
01:03:34.324 --> 01:03:36.675
- He had a divorce.
- My goodness!

1302
01:03:36.949 --> 01:03:39.472
You said there were only 2 people
here that have been married before.

1303
01:03:39.527 --> 01:03:41.753
I was married to my poems.

1304
01:03:42.363 --> 01:03:45.292
I almost misunderstood you, Won Shin.

1305
01:03:45.379 --> 01:03:48.933
I finally want to get
married to my love and...

1306
01:03:49.332 --> 01:03:52.956
write poems about my loving family.

1307
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.066
- I see.
- I thought you were really married before.

1308
01:03:56.097 --> 01:03:59.367
When you get married, will your
child have the word 'Si' in it?

1309
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:02.073
You might name your child
with the word 'Si'.

1310
01:04:02.097 --> 01:04:03.909
It could be Kang Si something.

1311
01:04:04.035 --> 01:04:06.191
Let's not make family jokes.

1312
01:04:06.433 --> 01:04:09.019
- I have a question for the poet.
- Please, ask away.

1313
01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.464
Can you say an acrostic
poem with "Number One'?

1314
01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:14.199
- He is a poet.
- Yes, it's possible for a poet.

1315
01:04:14.316 --> 01:04:15.713
Do you think it's possible?

1316
01:04:15.738 --> 01:04:17.455
- An acrostic poem.
- Go ahead!

1317
01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.480
Num!

1318
01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:21.351
With a loving heart.

1319
01:04:21.629 --> 01:04:24.429
- We said it starts with 'Num'.
- Num!

1320
01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:27.183
Will it be okay for me covet you?

1321
01:04:27.566 --> 01:04:28.566
Ber!

1322
01:04:30.246 --> 01:04:32.214
The bus has already left?

1323
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:36.511
- Won!
- My gosh! Taxi!

1324
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.340
Taxi!

1325
01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:43.933
That was very moving! It was so moving!

1326
01:04:44.066 --> 01:04:46.441
Did you really call a taxi? Taxi?

1327
01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:50.010
- Your nickname? - I'll introduce myself.
- Your nickname is Woo Sang?

1328
01:04:50.035 --> 01:04:52.791
- What does Woo Sang mean?
- It means 'Our Sang-min".

1329
01:04:52.816 --> 01:04:53.816
Hello, Boa.

1330
01:04:54.715 --> 01:04:57.268
- I have something to give you.
- What is it?

1331
01:04:57.293 --> 01:05:00.390
- There's nothing in this bag, Boa.
- No, there isn't.

1332
01:05:00.699 --> 01:05:04.385
- Will you put your hand in there?
Nothing is in there. - No, there isn't.

1333
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:05.410
Here.

1334
01:05:07.762 --> 01:05:08.762
(Ta-da)

1335
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.159
(I got this ready for you)

1336
01:05:12.558 --> 01:05:14.230
A flower appeared.

1337
01:05:14.926 --> 01:05:18.277
- He's so cool and it's only the beginning.
- Seriously?

1338
01:05:18.472 --> 01:05:20.699
There isn't anything I can't do.

1339
01:05:20.887 --> 01:05:22.674
Can you please calm down?

1340
01:05:22.699 --> 01:05:24.230
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1341
01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:25.355
- Boa!
- Yes?

1342
01:05:26.012 --> 01:05:30.542
You should check to see if you still have
your wallet. He's a famous pickpocket.

1343
01:05:30.871 --> 01:05:33.534
- He gets close by using magic.
- He even has a song.

1344
01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.324
"I Stole Four, Three-Four".

1345
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.291
- Could you answer the questions quickly?
- Sure.

1346
01:05:40.316 --> 01:05:42.870
I'd like to introduce myself now.

1347
01:05:42.988 --> 01:05:47.144
- Your nick name is Rose?
- Yes, it's Rose. A man who loves flowers.

1348
01:05:47.504 --> 01:05:50.605
My Korean friends usually
call me Jangmi (rose).

1349
01:05:51.277 --> 01:05:55.386
I'm a florist and I recently
returned from studying abroad.

1350
01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.480
Jangmi. My name is Rose.

1351
01:05:57.637 --> 01:06:01.151
Wait a second. Are you sure you
spelled your name correctly?

1352
01:06:01.176 --> 01:06:03.425
I think an 'L' should replace that 'R'.

1353
01:06:03.847 --> 01:06:06.597
- Why?
- Didn't he lose something?

1354
01:06:11.191 --> 01:06:13.127
- He's a genius!
- He knows how to speak English.

1355
01:06:13.152 --> 01:06:15.995
- You really are a genius!
- No, it was nothing.

1356
01:06:17.285 --> 01:06:20.964
- My real name is Rose.
- Yes, it's a very nice name.

1357
01:06:21.488 --> 01:06:22.488
Then...

1358
01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:25.652
- I have a question for you. - Okay.

1359
01:06:25.762 --> 01:06:27.167
He really is pretty.

1360
01:06:27.512 --> 01:06:32.527
Can you tell me three things you can
do for me if we were to get married?

1361
01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:33.621
Ready, go!

1362
01:06:35.371 --> 01:06:36.843
A house.

1363
01:06:37.066 --> 01:06:38.406
A building.

1364
01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:41.222
Lastly, divorce?

1365
01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:43.796
Breaking up?

1366
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.402
- He can give you everything.
- I got it! Alimony!

1367
01:06:48.729 --> 01:06:51.534
She's mean. She can be spiteful, can't she?

1368
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:54.831
Her emotions have dried up.

1369
01:06:54.972 --> 01:06:57.105
Any which way, who are you?

1370
01:06:57.785 --> 01:07:01.148
- Next person, please.
- He's making me uncomfortable.

1371
01:07:01.847 --> 01:07:04.666
Can you introduce yourself,
your nickname is Da Joong-yi?

1372
01:07:04.691 --> 01:07:08.369
- I'm sorry. - I'm not sure how many
episodes of our show he watched.

1373
01:07:08.394 --> 01:07:10.792
Your acting is the most noticeable today!

1374
01:07:11.082 --> 01:07:12.910
I'm not sure which character he's playing.

1375
01:07:13.051 --> 01:07:15.152
Hello, everyone. I'm...

1376
01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.347
I studied at Solomon Law School
and just passed my bar exam.

1377
01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:23.869
- My name is Da Joong-yi and I'm a lawyer.
- He's a lawyer.

1378
01:07:23.894 --> 01:07:25.744
How can you be a lawyer
when you stutter so much?

1379
01:07:25.769 --> 01:07:27.979
I actually am curious about something.

1380
01:07:28.004 --> 01:07:32.659
I'm actually a funny person, but everyone
here keeps saying that I'm not funny.

1381
01:07:32.879 --> 01:07:35.519
Is it possible to sue them for slander?

1382
01:07:35.902 --> 01:07:37.738
You can sue for that?

1383
01:07:38.371 --> 01:07:42.214
You know you're not funny. Stop lying!
It's all a lie!

1384
01:07:42.637 --> 01:07:44.620
I told you not to lie to me!

1385
01:07:44.926 --> 01:07:47.339
- May I drink some water?
- That's not water!

1386
01:07:47.512 --> 01:07:50.441
- It's not water.
- That could've been disastrous!

1387
01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:53.409
Isn't he a total mess?
He's just plain crazy!

1388
01:07:54.574 --> 01:07:56.292
- Wait a second.
- I'm sorry.

1389
01:07:56.394 --> 01:07:59.089
- I'm getting scared of him.
- Don't go, please!

1390
01:07:59.738 --> 01:08:04.550
- Why are you being mean to me? - I don't
like you! It's because I don't like you.

1391
01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:07.480
I need water. This isn't water!

1392
01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:10.581
- I'm in total shock!
- Wait, move. Get out of the way.

1393
01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:11.707
He's crazy.

1394
01:08:13.113 --> 01:08:17.113
- He's calm, thank you. - Thank you.
- I think he's a real psychopath.

1395
01:08:17.254 --> 01:08:22.277
- Ask me anything you're curious about.
- He suddenly changed.

1396
01:08:22.523 --> 01:08:25.761
- That's why his name is Da Joong-yi
(multiple personalities). - He keeps acting.

1397
01:08:25.847 --> 01:08:27.456
Next is Kyung Pal-yi.

1398
01:08:27.597 --> 01:08:31.495
Let me introduce myself. I'm a
choreographer and my name is Kyung Pal-yi.

1399
01:08:31.777 --> 01:08:32.964
He's an amazing person.

1400
01:08:33.097 --> 01:08:36.290
I'm a world-famous dance choreographer.

1401
01:08:36.315 --> 01:08:38.972
- Boa's "Number One" was...
- Yes, I choreographed that as well.

1402
01:08:39.035 --> 01:08:43.245
- Sunmi's song. - Yes, I choreographed
Sunmi's gun dance. I made all of that.

1403
01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:47.003
- You can make guns?
- Yes, I'm great at making M16s.

1404
01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:49.034
- He's a pro at making M16s.
- That's right.

1405
01:08:49.113 --> 01:08:51.346
I don't usually dance in front of others.

1406
01:08:51.371 --> 01:08:54.870
I don't usually dance with
people on the ground.

1407
01:08:55.183 --> 01:08:59.238
I usually communicate with aliens. I
communicate with them with my dances.

1408
01:08:59.347 --> 01:09:01.932
He received an award last
year, it's called Zero Award.

1409
01:09:01.957 --> 01:09:03.284
- That's right!
- Zero Award!

1410
01:09:03.441 --> 01:09:06.839
- I'll show you that dance.
- Who received the award with you?

1411
01:09:06.918 --> 01:09:08.386
- Didn't Kirang Karang get
the award with you? - Yes.

1412
01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:11.034
I was co-winners with Karang Karang.
The name is confusing.

1413
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.636
Now, cue the music!

1414
01:09:13.488 --> 01:09:17.210
You're good these days. You do
things without being asked.

1415
01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:19.304
It's an alien dance.

1416
01:09:19.558 --> 01:09:22.683
(Zero Award, Zero Award. Karang, Karang!)

1417
01:09:23.987 --> 01:09:25.206
It's perfect.

1418
01:09:25.965 --> 01:09:27.519
I can't go any further.

1419
01:09:27.722 --> 01:09:31.636
I can't show any more of the dance. NASA
would like to keep it under cover.

1420
01:09:31.887 --> 01:09:35.721
Unfortunately, it seems like you
learned your moves from someone.

1421
01:09:35.746 --> 01:09:40.671
That was great. Let's move onto the single
women since I know you are all curious.

1422
01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:44.159
Let's start with the nickname Ahni U.

1423
01:09:44.293 --> 01:09:45.293
Ahni U.

1424
01:09:46.043 --> 01:09:47.613
They're all so ugly here.

1425
01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:50.230
My name is Ahni U, IU's older sister.

1426
01:09:50.308 --> 01:09:52.300
- That's right.
- They look alike.

1427
01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:55.183
- My job is...
- You have a job?

1428
01:09:55.207 --> 01:09:58.316
- Unemployed.
- My gosh, you're so annoying.

1429
01:09:58.722 --> 01:10:00.847
I work at a chocolate factory.

1430
01:10:01.285 --> 01:10:04.105
Yes, it's called Ahni U Chocolate Factory.

1431
01:10:04.137 --> 01:10:06.363
I was recently promoted
to factory manager.

1432
01:10:06.388 --> 01:10:08.572
That's amazing when
you're so young.

1433
01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:13.894
If you pick me today, I'll melt
all your hearts like chocolate.

1434
01:10:15.691 --> 01:10:17.960
My... my goodness! Hey!

1435
01:10:18.108 --> 01:10:19.781
Kim Hee-chul!

1436
01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.222
- It's too much.
- He's already feeling my effect.

1437
01:10:22.347 --> 01:10:24.120
Will you go next, LM?

1438
01:10:24.308 --> 01:10:27.316
I think it's my turn. Hello, everyone.

1439
01:10:27.832 --> 01:10:31.894
My nickname is LM and I
was chosen as Miss Ulsan.

1440
01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:35.338
What does LM stand for? Does
it mean, 'Lousy Mongrel'?

1441
01:10:35.363 --> 01:10:37.347
It's abbreviation for
Limited Edition.

1442
01:10:37.372 --> 01:10:40.019
There isn't anyone the
world that looks like me.

1443
01:10:40.222 --> 01:10:42.324
Why is it 'M'? Shouldn't it be 'E'?

1444
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:45.269
(You're... you're right)

1445
01:10:47.433 --> 01:10:50.972
- It's okay, it's not important.
- No, it's not important.

1446
01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.346
Isn't it important for a person
who published an English book?

1447
01:10:53.371 --> 01:10:55.604
Could you stop sending squid to my house?

1448
01:10:55.629 --> 01:10:57.292
- Does it smell a lot?
- Yes.

1449
01:10:57.317 --> 01:11:00.589
- Next, we have Director Lee.
- It's your turn.

1450
01:11:01.027 --> 01:11:05.988
My nickname is Director Lee. As you
all know, I'm the star of Asia, Boa.

1451
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:08.081
- Asia's star.
- Yes, Asia's star.

1452
01:11:08.168 --> 01:11:11.464
You guys are in luck. You
have a chance to meet a...

1453
01:11:11.489 --> 01:11:14.652
woman with beauty, personality
and a great body.

1454
01:11:15.715 --> 01:11:17.659
- She's a great actress.
- Boa!

1455
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:18.730
What?

1456
01:11:19.027 --> 01:11:21.331
- You have a great personality?
- Don't I?

1457
01:11:21.387 --> 01:11:25.995
- A great body? It's not as great as mine.
- You don't even have a chest!

1458
01:11:28.816 --> 01:11:32.277
- Ahni U, do you need tissues?
- Ahni U?

1459
01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.612
There's nothing I can help you with.

1460
01:11:34.637 --> 01:11:39.253
- Contact me if you have any problem.
- I have a problem. My pride is hurt!

1461
01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:41.792
She's ruining my self-esteem!

1462
01:11:42.105 --> 01:11:43.949
Seriously! I can't believe this.

1463
01:11:44.144 --> 01:11:46.978
- Do you have anything else to
say, Director Lee? - Yes, I do.

1464
01:11:47.004 --> 01:11:49.909
I'd like nothing else but
to dance with my husband...

1465
01:11:49.965 --> 01:11:52.855
since I lived my entire
life as a dancing singer.

1466
01:11:53.191 --> 01:11:58.105
I'd like to meet a man, who I can spend
the rest of my life dancing with.

1467
01:11:58.152 --> 01:12:01.869
- If you're talking about dance, Kyung
Pal-yi might be the one. - I think so, too.

1468
01:12:01.894 --> 01:12:04.847
I do feel like you two
might be a good match.

1469
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:09.812
That's why, I decided to show you the
dance I wanted to dance with you guys.

1470
01:12:09.996 --> 01:12:15.194
I came here with my top choreographer
to show you the dance.

1471
01:12:15.496 --> 01:12:18.635
- Will you come in?
- She brought a choreographer?

1472
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:19.660
(Ta-da)

1473
01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:23.718
- My gosh!
- He sure does a lot of things, doesn't he?

1474
01:12:24.004 --> 01:12:25.988
You're still here?

1475
01:12:26.941 --> 01:12:31.222
My name is Dance Jang and I'm
Boa's top choreographer.

1476
01:12:31.691 --> 01:12:36.605
It's nice to meet you. I hope you all can
dance with Boa after I show you the dance.

1477
01:12:37.082 --> 01:12:38.722
- Let's go.
- You'll be surprised.

1478
01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:39.832
Music!

1479
01:12:40.082 --> 01:12:42.019
- He's so cheesy.
- Wait a second...

1480
01:12:43.785 --> 01:12:45.234
Wait! This song?

1481
01:12:48.912 --> 01:12:52.331
(Boa's wrote and released
"Only One" in 2012)

1482
01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:57.294
(She dances with a male
dancer and it brought...

1483
01:12:57.319 --> 01:13:00.578
on headlines because of
the dance's difficulty)

1484
01:13:01.858 --> 01:13:04.798
(She's going to dance to this
song with her top choreographer?)

1485
01:13:04.823 --> 01:13:06.304
(Rushes in)

1486
01:13:08.456 --> 01:13:09.730
He must've learned it.

1487
01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.155
(It's similar, up to now)

1488
01:13:16.703 --> 01:13:19.171
(They can't believe their eyes)

1489
01:13:20.485 --> 01:13:21.485
(He's good?)

1490
01:13:21.676 --> 01:13:23.487
He's doing well. He's good.

1491
01:13:23.962 --> 01:13:24.962
(Cheesy)

1492
01:13:27.704 --> 01:13:30.046
He really must be a top choreographer.

1493
01:13:30.303 --> 01:13:33.788
(His techniques are matched
with Asia's Star, Boa)

1494
01:13:34.065 --> 01:13:35.921
(Shaking it)

1495
01:13:38.507 --> 01:13:39.905
(Crashes)

1496
01:13:41.022 --> 01:13:44.425
(The set's tiles are moved
around from his 200-pound body)

1497
01:13:46.401 --> 01:13:47.909
What's wrong with him?

1498
01:13:47.934 --> 01:13:49.050
(Falls down)

1499
01:13:51.144 --> 01:13:52.960
(Flapping around)

1500
01:13:53.347 --> 01:13:55.710
He used to be such a great student too.

1501
01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:58.269
Can you give them a round of applause?

1502
01:13:58.551 --> 01:14:00.261
He's better than we thought.

1503
01:14:00.504 --> 01:14:04.675
He trained so hard for two weeks
that his knees were bruised.

1504
01:14:09.552 --> 01:14:12.643
(News anchor Jang Sung-kyu sent his
own video in because he was so moved)

1505
01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:15.097
- This is why I'm a top choreographer.
- My goodness.

1506
01:14:15.215 --> 01:14:16.667
That's amazing.

1507
01:14:16.847 --> 01:14:18.222
Who will try first?

1508
01:14:18.285 --> 01:14:20.800
- May I try first?
- Yes, Ahni U.

1509
01:14:21.441 --> 01:14:23.619
- That was hard.
- What the heck? Move.

1510
01:14:23.644 --> 01:14:25.894
- Come on out, Rose.
- Me?

1511
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.441
You're going to play my part?

1512
01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:31.534
- Of course.
- My gosh, this is totally unbelievable.

1513
01:14:31.558 --> 01:14:34.745
Why are you wearing a sumo outfit, Rose?

1514
01:14:35.379 --> 01:14:37.999
- Let's try this.
- It's because I'm a florist.

1515
01:14:38.526 --> 01:14:41.909
(It's time for Rose and
Ahni U's couple dance)

1516
01:14:45.542 --> 01:14:47.765
- That's good.
- They're doing it right.

1517
01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:49.577
(Full of heart)

1518
01:14:51.774 --> 01:14:54.519
What are they supposed to be? Angels?

1519
01:14:56.547 --> 01:15:00.011
He's trying hard, isn't he?
He's even laying down.

1520
01:15:05.016 --> 01:15:06.316
(Laughing)

1521
01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:09.417
This is so humiliating!

1522
01:15:10.722 --> 01:15:13.066
I'm so humiliated!

1523
01:15:14.645 --> 01:15:15.645
(Bewitching)

1524
01:15:17.164 --> 01:15:19.878
- Hang onto him.
- I'm so humiliated.

1525
01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:24.519
Didn't I say I'd melt your
heart if you picked me?

1526
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:26.624
I've melted too much.

1527
01:15:26.926 --> 01:15:28.663
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1528
01:15:29.035 --> 01:15:31.472
Do you have anything else to show us?

1529
01:15:33.308 --> 01:15:35.136
No, I should leave now.

1530
01:15:36.152 --> 01:15:40.847
I hope you finally meet your
match made in heaven, Boa.

1531
01:15:42.355 --> 01:15:44.816
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you!

1532
01:15:45.012 --> 01:15:47.394
- Bye!
- Bye, Sang-kyu!

1533
01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:52.886
I believe everyone had the
opportunity to introduce themselves.

1534
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.277
There's something we need
to do after introductions.

1535
01:15:55.371 --> 01:15:56.933
First impression? First thoughts?

1536
01:15:56.958 --> 01:16:01.710
Let's take a moment to verify
who everyone is interested in.

1537
01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:05.933
Write down the person you're interested
and fold the paper in half, please.

1538
01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:10.182
We have a 14K gold couple ring if you
become a couple with someone today.

1539
01:16:10.207 --> 01:16:14.159
I'm telling you, we're going to
make sure to give that away today.

1540
01:16:14.417 --> 01:16:17.597
(Who is everyone interested in
based on first impression?)

1541
01:16:17.754 --> 01:16:20.956
I wonder where the poet's
arrow will point to.

1542
01:16:21.237 --> 01:16:23.822
- I'm looking forward to this.
- My goodness.

1543
01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:27.213
- I hope we don't overlap with one another.
- I'm not sure if this is right.

1544
01:16:27.238 --> 01:16:28.726
As of right now...

1545
01:16:29.605 --> 01:16:31.613
his arrow is pointing toward LM.

1546
01:16:32.715 --> 01:16:33.715
(Puzzled)

1547
01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:37.933
I remember we were married
in our previous lives.

1548
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:42.831
Now, I wonder who LM has chosen
based on first impressions.

1549
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:45.722
- I can't believe this.
- Could it be?

1550
01:16:45.855 --> 01:16:48.034
She's chosen him as well.

1551
01:16:50.738 --> 01:16:51.738
(Kicks)

1552
01:16:53.707 --> 01:16:57.620
It doesn't mean you're a couple.
This is just first impressions.

1553
01:16:57.777 --> 01:17:00.113
Your hair fell off.

1554
01:17:01.332 --> 01:17:04.722
Pick you hair, please. Next is Sang-yeob.

1555
01:17:05.644 --> 01:17:07.874
Let's see who the lawyer picked.

1556
01:17:08.027 --> 01:17:11.308
Mr. Lee has chosen Hee-mi.

1557
01:17:11.652 --> 01:17:13.589
Hee-mi?

1558
01:17:15.176 --> 01:17:19.120
- That's great.
- Now, let's see who Hee-mi chose.

1559
01:17:21.551 --> 01:17:25.097
- This is where her arrow is pointing.
- Who is it? - Rose! Rose!

1560
01:17:25.715 --> 01:17:27.252
Can you show us where his arrow is?

1561
01:17:27.277 --> 01:17:29.706
Who did Jang-hoon choose?

1562
01:17:29.762 --> 01:17:32.697
- I can't believe she chose me.
- I think he's being sincere.

1563
01:17:32.722 --> 01:17:36.159
I think he's sincere about his choice.
Seo Jang-hoon chose...

1564
01:17:37.737 --> 01:17:38.737
Hee-mi!

1565
01:17:39.058 --> 01:17:42.324
We have two potential
couples from the beginning.

1566
01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:45.738
- You're so popular!
- I think I might finally get married!

1567
01:17:45.777 --> 01:17:48.565
- I think so!
- Remember, it's only first impressions.

1568
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:51.183
Let's not fail this time around.

1569
01:17:51.738 --> 01:17:55.636
I think it's time we see
who Kyung-pal chose.

1570
01:17:56.262 --> 01:17:57.597
Wait a second.

1571
01:17:57.777 --> 01:18:00.190
You're going to go fix your make-up?

1572
01:18:00.215 --> 01:18:03.644
- She's going somewhere.
- Women need to keep their secrets.

1573
01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:05.050
Yes, I'm sorry.

1574
01:18:05.207 --> 01:18:10.652
Ahni U joined us for a little bit, but
she actually needs to be somewhere now.

1575
01:18:10.957 --> 01:18:14.761
How can she just leave when
she was matched up with me?

1576
01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.917
My boyfriend is Hyun Joo-yeob
and he's coming to pick me up.

1577
01:18:21.012 --> 01:18:23.736
(Where did Ahni U go after
getting away from Rose?)

1578
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.128
(Ahni U went to the Golden Disk
Award show to receive her award)

1579
01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:32.136
It's amazing who Kyung-hoon chose.

1580
01:18:33.401 --> 01:18:36.300
I think Kyung-hoon is
showing his true colors.

1581
01:18:37.316 --> 01:18:41.449
- He chose Director Lee.
- He's 100% sincere on his choice.

1582
01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:45.675
- Yes, he's sincere. - I've known
him for a long time, so I know.

1583
01:18:45.832 --> 01:18:48.210
I'm in trouble.

1584
01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:52.034
Sang-min's heart is headed
over to her as well.

1585
01:18:52.387 --> 01:18:53.791
He chose Boa as well.

1586
01:18:53.816 --> 01:18:57.799
- I'm up against stiff competition. - He
still has passion. His passion is alive.

1587
01:18:57.824 --> 01:19:00.956
Last but not least, let's
see who Director Lee chose.

1588
01:19:01.176 --> 01:19:04.077
- This is exciting.
- Her feelings are headed to!

1589
01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.792
Can you play special effect music?

1590
01:19:07.261 --> 01:19:11.394
(He draws her arrow with
live back ground music)

1591
01:19:12.425 --> 01:19:14.679
I don't think it'll end there.

1592
01:19:18.699 --> 01:19:20.808
(It's quite suspenseful)

1593
01:19:21.379 --> 01:19:24.460
It must be one of us!
It's either you or me.

1594
01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.765
It's Kyung Pal-yi!

1595
01:19:29.597 --> 01:19:31.150
(Mixed feelings of joy and sorrow)

1596
01:19:31.176 --> 01:19:35.191
Look at how many couples we
already have from the beginning?

1597
01:19:35.691 --> 01:19:37.738
We already have three couples!

1598
01:19:38.285 --> 01:19:39.777
This is amazing.

1599
01:19:39.988 --> 01:19:41.714
But, you know what?

1600
01:19:41.956 --> 01:19:44.464
He had to say farewell to his
partner as soon as they met.

1601
01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:47.019
He's the symbol of farewells.

1602
01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:49.752
Look at his expression.

1603
01:19:49.777 --> 01:19:53.128
This is such a coincidence. How
could such a thing happen?

1604
01:19:53.441 --> 01:19:55.222
That's quite amazing.

1605
01:19:56.488 --> 01:19:57.488
Swag!

1606
01:19:58.363 --> 01:20:01.245
We still have two single women here.

1607
01:20:01.558 --> 01:20:03.855
Remember, it was just our first impression.

1608
01:20:03.918 --> 01:20:08.409
- We'll now start to finally get to
know one another. - This sounds fun.

1609
01:20:08.855 --> 01:20:12.464
I'm sure all of you guys
are curious as to know...

1610
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:15.113
what the other singles think about you.

1611
01:20:15.176 --> 01:20:18.730
That's why, we've prepared
a special game to...

1612
01:20:18.755 --> 01:20:22.730
see what the other singles think
about you based on your image.

1613
01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:26.643
We've prepared a game called,
Let's find out about your image.

1614
01:20:26.668 --> 01:20:31.214
We'll start off slowly since
we're all entertainers here.

1615
01:20:31.715 --> 01:20:37.136
Choose a person you think has kissed
another person within the last week.

1616
01:20:37.644 --> 01:20:40.613
A person you think that has
kissed another person.

1617
01:20:41.066 --> 01:20:42.769
One, two, three!

1618
01:20:45.738 --> 01:20:48.416
It looks like Kyung Pal-yi has two votes.

1619
01:20:48.441 --> 01:20:52.190
- I chose Da Joong-yi.
- Director Lee has 2 votes. - I chose Rose.

1620
01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:56.472
- Rose? - Why did you choose Rose?
Please put your hands down.

1621
01:20:57.019 --> 01:21:01.457
Well... I chose him because I think
he has a very free lifestyle.

1622
01:21:02.418 --> 01:21:05.758
- Free?
- You guessed correctly. You get a prize.

1623
01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:11.152
- He's free.
- Yes, he lives a very free lifestyle.

1624
01:21:11.355 --> 01:21:13.408
I'm sure it didn't stop at just kissing.

1625
01:21:13.433 --> 01:21:16.824
How come you chose LM, Da Joong-yi?

1626
01:21:16.996 --> 01:21:20.549
She seems like the person to have
a lot of men hang around her.

1627
01:21:20.574 --> 01:21:22.324
Do you really think that?

1628
01:21:23.324 --> 01:21:26.269
Even guys wouldn't kiss me.

1629
01:21:26.855 --> 01:21:28.885
What's with your voice, suddenly?

1630
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:31.191
- I'm sorry.
- You totally surprised me.

1631
01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:32.978
I forgot, I'm a woman.

1632
01:21:33.004 --> 01:21:34.480
Don't lie to me!

1633
01:21:35.144 --> 01:21:37.667
Why is he acting like that?
Is he crazy?

1634
01:21:37.738 --> 01:21:41.316
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1635
01:21:41.722 --> 01:21:44.152
Hey! Come here. Hurry it up.

1636
01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:46.187
Come in here.

1637
01:21:46.457 --> 01:21:48.315
You're really crazy, aren't you?

1638
01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.886
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

1639
01:21:49.957 --> 01:21:51.705
What's wrong with you? Be quiet!

1640
01:21:51.730 --> 01:21:55.633
- I didn't know you had a truth room here.
- I told you to calm down!

1641
01:21:56.043 --> 01:21:59.551
- Did you take care of it?
- I think he finally calmed down.

1642
01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:01.441
Hello. Hello, everyone.

1643
01:22:01.902 --> 01:22:03.988
That room works miracles.

1644
01:22:04.324 --> 01:22:07.002
I'll ask the next question. This
question is quite revealing.

1645
01:22:07.027 --> 01:22:08.402
Think carefully.

1646
01:22:08.887 --> 01:22:13.378
Who do you think is the type of person
to fall for a person in one-day and...

1647
01:22:13.949 --> 01:22:16.589
spend the first night with them as well?

1648
01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:19.902
The first day. Yes, the
first they meet someone.

1649
01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:23.291
- I think someone is going to get
all the votes. - One, two, three!

1650
01:22:23.316 --> 01:22:25.949
- This is perfect.
- They got all the votes.

1651
01:22:26.535 --> 01:22:30.308
- Do you get to vote as well?
- No, I'm just pointing at you.

1652
01:22:30.496 --> 01:22:32.136
Who did you choose?

1653
01:22:32.324 --> 01:22:35.409
- I chose Rose.
- Why did you choose Rose?

1654
01:22:35.449 --> 01:22:38.128
I saw Rose that night.

1655
01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:43.699
I saw him walking into room
1205 with an unfamiliar lady...

1656
01:22:44.019 --> 01:22:46.378
at a hotel, I can't disclose.

1657
01:22:46.582 --> 01:22:49.745
- Why were you there?
- It means you were at the same hotel!

1658
01:22:49.769 --> 01:22:52.847
That was my first day with someone as well.

1659
01:22:53.715 --> 01:22:56.543
The important thing is
that I saw you there!

1660
01:22:56.730 --> 01:22:59.089
Can you tell us who she looked like?

1661
01:22:59.621 --> 01:23:02.789
- I'll bring you down with me.
- You two are unbelievable.

1662
01:23:02.957 --> 01:23:06.104
- I chose the person behind him.
- Rose? You chose Rose?

1663
01:23:06.129 --> 01:23:08.096
- It's confusing.
- This is unexpected.

1664
01:23:08.121 --> 01:23:10.276
You seem like you know something.

1665
01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:14.800
- Why do you keep picking me? - You must've
seen what he was like at the party.

1666
01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:19.672
I feel like he's surrounded by women.
I also think he likes young women.

1667
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:23.875
- Look at how he's reacting. - You got
the second question right as well!

1668
01:23:24.121 --> 01:23:25.851
That's two in a row.

1669
01:23:26.019 --> 01:23:28.533
I didn't know there were right answers.

1670
01:23:28.558 --> 01:23:29.558
You're perfect.

1671
01:23:29.613 --> 01:23:34.113
I believe this is one of the most
important questions a person can ask...

1672
01:23:34.347 --> 01:23:37.753
when they meet someone and
think about marriage.

1673
01:23:37.949 --> 01:23:39.854
This image is very important.

1674
01:23:39.879 --> 01:23:43.713
Please choose a person you think
would have extra marital affairs.

1675
01:23:43.738 --> 01:23:45.080
The most unfaithful person.

1676
01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:49.449
This is solely based on intuition. A
guy you think might be unfaithful.

1677
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.495
It could be a woman as well.
One, two, three!

1678
01:23:53.956 --> 01:23:57.754
(Ho-dong: 3 votes; Jang-hoon:
2 votes; Kyung-hoon: 1 vote)

1679
01:23:57.988 --> 01:23:59.283
What's this?

1680
01:23:59.308 --> 01:24:01.409
- LM?
- I chose Min Kyung-hoon.

1681
01:24:01.574 --> 01:24:02.972
Min Kyung-hoon!

1682
01:24:03.199 --> 01:24:05.284
- Rose.
- She chose Rose again.

1683
01:24:05.613 --> 01:24:07.824
Who did you choose Woo Sang?

1684
01:24:08.074 --> 01:24:09.972
Woo Sang chose Won Shin.

1685
01:24:10.207 --> 01:24:11.822
Kyung Pal-yi chose Won Shin as well.

1686
01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:13.339
Rose chose Won Shin.

1687
01:24:13.441 --> 01:24:15.425
In my opinion, I'm sure it's him.

1688
01:24:15.887 --> 01:24:18.261
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1689
01:24:18.566 --> 01:24:20.502
He looks like he's unfaithful because...

1690
01:24:20.527 --> 01:24:23.136
he's the best-looking in this crowd.

1691
01:24:24.769 --> 01:24:25.909
Angel face.

1692
01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:30.062
Anyone can see it's true.
Can you look at the camera?

1693
01:24:30.425 --> 01:24:32.995
- My, he's good-looking.
- He might be a good wrestler.

1694
01:24:33.121 --> 01:24:34.363
He's perfect.

1695
01:24:34.388 --> 01:24:40.855
I believe women will take one
look and melt over his face.

1696
01:24:40.894 --> 01:24:45.089
That's the reason I chose Won Shin
as someone who'd have an affair.

1697
01:24:45.355 --> 01:24:48.683
It looks like Director Lee
chose Rose once again.

1698
01:24:48.761 --> 01:24:52.667
Everyone voted for Won Shin,
but you chose Rose again.

1699
01:24:52.722 --> 01:24:54.062
May I ask, why?

1700
01:24:54.527 --> 01:24:58.097
I feel like he's the type to
change his feelings for a woman...

1701
01:24:58.347 --> 01:25:00.777
when he sees a prettier woman.

1702
01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.995
- You must be a genius at quizzes.
- Three times in a row?

1703
01:25:05.097 --> 01:25:08.072
How come she keeps getting
all the answers right?

1704
01:25:08.097 --> 01:25:09.152
It's like...

1705
01:25:09.621 --> 01:25:12.112
she's piercing me through my heart.

1706
01:25:12.137 --> 01:25:14.089
How does she know me so well?

1707
01:25:14.113 --> 01:25:16.761
She sees your image as trash.

1708
01:25:18.472 --> 01:25:23.394
He's a pro at changing his feelings. That's
why his nickname is 'Transforming Robot'.

1709
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:25.433
(Finished transforming)

1710
01:25:25.676 --> 01:25:26.964
I felt a bit guilty.

1711
01:25:27.058 --> 01:25:31.080
I believe everyone has an idea on who
they chose as their partner today.

1712
01:25:31.105 --> 01:25:34.034
That's why, this will be our last game.

1713
01:25:34.137 --> 01:25:37.878
There's no better game than this
to get close to one another.

1714
01:25:38.441 --> 01:25:43.214
- What is it? - It's a hot trend to
play this game. It's 'King's Game'.

1715
01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:46.008
(King's Game)

1716
01:25:47.066 --> 01:25:49.367
Yes, let's play King's Game.

1717
01:25:50.043 --> 01:25:52.706
Please pick a number. Where should I start?

1718
01:25:53.004 --> 01:25:57.113
- How about the guys pick? - Here we
go. You could peek at the numbers.

1719
01:25:57.254 --> 01:26:00.752
- It's okay, just as long you don't see,
Soo-geun. - No, I won't. - That's right.

1720
01:26:00.777 --> 01:26:03.049
(The women pick their numbers as well)

1721
01:26:03.074 --> 01:26:05.261
- Did you all see your numbers?
- Yes.

1722
01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:09.480
Let's go. We should always start
the game off with number one.

1723
01:26:09.933 --> 01:26:11.789
Number one will...

1724
01:26:13.652 --> 01:26:19.253
Let's make it simple. Number one will
pick up number three and do five squats.

1725
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:21.651
- A simple exercise.
- Isn't five times too much?

1726
01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:25.589
- No, it's not. Why are you acting like
you're number one? - Wow, I'm not!

1727
01:26:25.668 --> 01:26:27.151
There's a twist of events.

1728
01:26:27.176 --> 01:26:29.971
Number 1 will squat 5 times
while carrying number 3.

1729
01:26:29.996 --> 01:26:33.245
Number 3 will squat 5 times
while carrying number 5.

1730
01:26:33.394 --> 01:26:35.674
Come on out, number 1. Who is number 1?

1731
01:26:35.699 --> 01:26:37.800
- Number 1?
- Maybe no one chose number 1.

1732
01:26:37.949 --> 01:26:39.734
What number is this?

1733
01:26:41.418 --> 01:26:44.070
- That's number 1!
- Come on out, number 1.

1734
01:26:44.426 --> 01:26:45.984
Who is number 3?

1735
01:26:46.426 --> 01:26:49.574
- Number 3?
- I think this is going to be beautiful.

1736
01:26:50.019 --> 01:26:51.824
(Sang-yeob is number 3)

1737
01:26:52.699 --> 01:26:54.472
I'll let you squat three times.

1738
01:26:55.051 --> 01:26:56.988
- Lift this leg up.
- This one?

1739
01:26:57.013 --> 01:27:00.484
- Yeah, it's easier to lift you
with this leg. - Alright, let's go.

1740
01:27:01.097 --> 01:27:02.097
One.

1741
01:27:03.082 --> 01:27:04.745
- He's strong.
- Two.

1742
01:27:05.933 --> 01:27:07.558
- Three.
- Three!

1743
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:10.894
Won Shin is very strong!

1744
01:27:11.121 --> 01:27:13.518
Now, number 3 will squat
while carrying number 5.

1745
01:27:13.543 --> 01:27:17.004
Number 3 will do squats carrying number 5.
Who is number 5?

1746
01:27:18.644 --> 01:27:20.195
Who is number 5?

1747
01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:23.156
(Number 5 is Jang-hoon)

1748
01:27:23.699 --> 01:27:25.221
You have to squat 3 times!

1749
01:27:25.246 --> 01:27:27.276
Aren't I great at choosing numbers?

1750
01:27:27.301 --> 01:27:29.910
You need to do 3 squats, no matter what.

1751
01:27:30.152 --> 01:27:33.205
- It would've been bad if I kept 5 squats.
- I might die.

1752
01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:36.426
- Be careful.
- You're going to get hurt, Jang-hoon.

1753
01:27:36.949 --> 01:27:39.799
- Da Joong-yi must be strong.
- Try to carry him.

1754
01:27:39.824 --> 01:27:41.726
(He's carrying him)

1755
01:27:43.262 --> 01:27:46.339
(The person being carried
is about to die as well)

1756
01:27:46.363 --> 01:27:48.253
I can't do this! I can't do it!

1757
01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:52.331
- He's really heavy!
- Take a seat again.

1758
01:27:52.707 --> 01:27:57.183
- Let's pick again. We'll let the ladies
pick first. - We have to do this again.

1759
01:27:58.472 --> 01:27:59.472
(Peeks)

1760
01:28:00.519 --> 01:28:01.652
This time...

1761
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:05.097
you'll stand in front of
one another and dance.

1762
01:28:05.371 --> 01:28:07.518
The person, who laughs first loses.

1763
01:28:07.543 --> 01:28:10.526
The winner gets to splash a
bucket of water on the loser.

1764
01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.440
This will be the worst punishment.

1765
01:28:12.465 --> 01:28:15.648
- Is there a number you'd like me to choose?
- Five!

1766
01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:22.042
Five? No, number six and number seven!
Come on out, it's our first game.

1767
01:28:22.465 --> 01:28:24.027
Come out, number 6 and 7.

1768
01:28:24.355 --> 01:28:25.826
He's driving me crazy.

1769
01:28:25.851 --> 01:28:29.484
(Ho-dong is number 6 and
Jang-hoon is number 7)

1770
01:28:30.574 --> 01:28:33.535
(He's like a permanent guest
on the 'King's Game')

1771
01:28:34.707 --> 01:28:36.660
(Somehow this scene is familiar)

1772
01:28:36.731 --> 01:28:39.398
- Are you number 5?
- Are you number 7?

1773
01:28:41.519 --> 01:28:42.519
Number 5!

1774
01:28:43.215 --> 01:28:45.351
(Whenever they play the 'King's Game'...)

1775
01:28:45.402 --> 01:28:47.429
Number 3 and number 8!

1776
01:28:47.824 --> 01:28:50.414
(Soo-geun somehow always finds him)

1777
01:28:50.672 --> 01:28:53.236
I really don't know the
what number everyone has.

1778
01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:54.854
(Controller of all 'King's Game')

1779
01:28:54.879 --> 01:28:57.953
I didn't see. How could I see your numbers?

1780
01:28:58.738 --> 01:29:00.510
- Seriously?
- How can I see?

1781
01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:02.965
- No way. - Look at each and what?

1782
01:29:03.277 --> 01:29:05.324
(They're starting to warm-up)

1783
01:29:05.496 --> 01:29:08.206
There's no way Jang-hoon can win this.

1784
01:29:08.347 --> 01:29:10.347
- Get ready.
- Okay.

1785
01:29:10.933 --> 01:29:13.636
One, two, three, four!

1786
01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:17.156
(He bursts out laughing in 2 seconds)

1787
01:29:17.426 --> 01:29:19.355
No way! You can't do that!

1788
01:29:19.668 --> 01:29:22.456
That's totally unfair! This doesn't count!

1789
01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:25.183
(He wins by suppressing his laugh)

1790
01:29:25.512 --> 01:29:27.909
- He totally burst out laughing.
- I wanted to win.

1791
01:29:27.933 --> 01:29:30.394
You're pulling out all the trick to win.

1792
01:29:30.769 --> 01:29:33.299
- Geez!
- We can't do anything about it.

1793
01:29:33.324 --> 01:29:36.652
You laughed too loud. There's
no way for us to help you.

1794
01:29:36.808 --> 01:29:40.445
- Do you think it's better if
he squats down? - It's okay.

1795
01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:44.191
Use the bucket to...

1796
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.277
(His wig falls off)

1797
01:29:50.008 --> 01:29:53.033
- I can't believe his wig fell off.
- That was our first round.

1798
01:29:53.058 --> 01:29:56.300
Here you go, your wig.
Let's pick numbers again.

1799
01:29:56.652 --> 01:29:58.293
Let's go again.

1800
01:29:59.285 --> 01:30:02.229
- Pick one.
- You can't watch us picking numbers.

1801
01:30:02.254 --> 01:30:04.300
- He saw.
- No, I didn't. Why are you so suspicious?

1802
01:30:04.363 --> 01:30:06.902
- You peeked!
- Yeah, I think he saw too!

1803
01:30:07.199 --> 01:30:10.519
How could I see? Are you
nervous that I'll choose you?

1804
01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:13.054
I've always been picked.

1805
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:16.304
Number 5!

1806
01:30:16.901 --> 01:30:19.971
(How come sad premonitions
are never wrong?)

1807
01:30:19.996 --> 01:30:24.433
You're number five. Let's
find out who number seven is.

1808
01:30:24.847 --> 01:30:27.179
Come one out, number seven.

1809
01:30:27.942 --> 01:30:29.886
(Number 7 is Boa)

1810
01:30:33.042 --> 01:30:34.042
Okay, okay.

1811
01:30:34.371 --> 01:30:36.449
You'll lose if you laugh.

1812
01:30:36.676 --> 01:30:37.676
Get ready!

1813
01:30:38.051 --> 01:30:40.909
- Be sad. You're about to cry.
- Start the music!

1814
01:30:41.137 --> 01:30:42.379
Let's go!

1815
01:30:42.926 --> 01:30:45.191
Start the music! Let's go!

1816
01:30:46.859 --> 01:30:49.379
(He's loaded his face with ugliness)

1817
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:52.417
You have to look at one another.

1818
01:30:52.441 --> 01:30:53.674
Look at each other.

1819
01:30:53.699 --> 01:30:57.277
(He raises the ugliness to 30%)

1820
01:30:58.353 --> 01:30:59.980
They're toe-to-toe.

1821
01:31:01.551 --> 01:31:03.500
You need to funny!

1822
01:31:04.363 --> 01:31:07.800
- You can't look away from one another!
- Look at each other.

1823
01:31:07.825 --> 01:31:09.807
(He raises the ugliness to 50%)

1824
01:31:09.832 --> 01:31:11.753
- What the heck?
- Good job!

1825
01:31:11.855 --> 01:31:14.781
(He raises the ugliness level to 75%)

1826
01:31:15.067 --> 01:31:17.328
She laughed, she almost laughed.

1827
01:31:17.542 --> 01:31:19.031
Do it, Boa!

1828
01:31:20.819 --> 01:31:23.502
(He's starting to recharge his
ugliness for the final win)

1829
01:31:23.527 --> 01:31:27.636
If you want to support someone, go dance
behind the person you want to win.

1830
01:31:27.808 --> 01:31:31.550
If you want to support Director
Lee, go dance behind her!

1831
01:31:32.215 --> 01:31:37.531
( Before he can release 100% of his
ugliness, he bursts out laughing)

1832
01:31:40.315 --> 01:31:42.539
(The final boss appears)

1833
01:31:43.262 --> 01:31:45.050
Is that the end?

1834
01:31:45.926 --> 01:31:49.402
- Her supporter wins the match!
- You can't win him.

1835
01:31:50.206 --> 01:31:52.441
He went to go help her.

1836
01:31:54.429 --> 01:31:56.346
(Boa wins with LM's help)

1837
01:31:56.371 --> 01:31:59.205
That means, Boa can splash water on him.

1838
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:02.863
He didn't do anything. I couldn't
help but laugh at his face.

1839
01:32:03.652 --> 01:32:04.875
Isn't my presence great?

1840
01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:08.863
I saw him coming toward me and
his nostrils were flaring.

1841
01:32:09.668 --> 01:32:13.632
You know the face he has when he
wants to show you something funny?

1842
01:32:13.676 --> 01:32:17.909
What's funny is when you splash water on
him and hit his nose with the bucket.

1843
01:32:18.191 --> 01:32:19.721
You'll cut my lips.

1844
01:32:19.746 --> 01:32:21.933
- You'll cut me open.
- Let's see his nose fly away.

1845
01:32:22.043 --> 01:32:25.908
- No, I'll get cut. - We can't air it if
he bleeds a lot, so just a little bit.

1846
01:32:25.933 --> 01:32:29.663
- Just a little bit.
- Do you think you'll need more water?

1847
01:32:33.266 --> 01:32:34.744
That was a perfect hit.

1848
01:32:34.769 --> 01:32:36.949
You must've done this before.

1849
01:32:39.111 --> 01:32:40.437
(Soaking)

1850
01:32:40.965 --> 01:32:42.510
- My gosh.
- Clean yourself off.

1851
01:32:42.535 --> 01:32:45.408
This is the reason you put
an apron on me today.

1852
01:32:45.433 --> 01:32:46.734
Let's get married!

1853
01:32:46.759 --> 01:32:52.077
Our couple match-making games for our
company have all come to an end.

1854
01:32:52.112 --> 01:32:55.002
We only have our final decision left.

1855
01:32:55.027 --> 01:32:57.894
I wonder which who our
next couples will be...

1856
01:32:57.919 --> 01:33:02.003
from 'Let's get married' company and
I'm looking forward to the outcome.

1857
01:33:02.277 --> 01:33:04.676
Aren't you our lead character today?

1858
01:33:04.701 --> 01:33:08.223
Da Joong-yi! Let's see who Da
Joong-yi's final choice is.

1859
01:33:09.637 --> 01:33:13.558
His final choice was Director Lee.

1860
01:33:13.597 --> 01:33:15.187
Sorry, Yeong-mi!

1861
01:33:15.425 --> 01:33:17.470
(He begins acting by himself
and starts laughing)

1862
01:33:17.495 --> 01:33:20.729
The next person is Won Shin.
This is Won Shin's choice.

1863
01:33:20.754 --> 01:33:25.441
Just as I thought, Won Shin. Once he
chooses someone he never changes his mind.

1864
01:33:25.527 --> 01:33:29.136
He's showing us that he's
only human by choosing Boa.

1865
01:33:29.230 --> 01:33:30.964
How could you?

1866
01:33:31.965 --> 01:33:35.378
- Did you change your mind after
the first impressions? - Yes.

1867
01:33:35.691 --> 01:33:39.808
Next is Rose. He heard that people
thought of him as a womanizer.

1868
01:33:40.043 --> 01:33:43.027
Just as I thought. Once a
cheater, always a cheater.

1869
01:33:43.269 --> 01:33:44.769
What the heck?

1870
01:33:44.847 --> 01:33:46.456
- Next!
- I still have 2 votes.

1871
01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:49.221
- This is Woo Sang's choice.
- Woo Sang isn't my style.

1872
01:33:49.246 --> 01:33:52.214
- This is as if...
- How could you guys?

1873
01:33:53.097 --> 01:33:56.769
- She's being attacked by all the guys.
- Don't give up, LM!

1874
01:33:57.246 --> 01:33:59.581
- Really?
- The next person is Min Kyung-hoon.

1875
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:01.089
You're my last chance.

1876
01:34:03.573 --> 01:34:04.952
I can't see clearly.

1877
01:34:05.277 --> 01:34:07.995
He lightly wrote Boa on the bottom.

1878
01:34:09.293 --> 01:34:10.780
What the heck?

1879
01:34:11.472 --> 01:34:13.308
These are our results.

1880
01:34:13.621 --> 01:34:17.726
- Let's see who Yeong-mi chose.
- Do we have to, when no one chose her?

1881
01:34:18.535 --> 01:34:21.119
We're still considerate
of everyone's feelings.

1882
01:34:21.144 --> 01:34:23.941
- Don't my feelings matter?
- It's nice to keep secrets too.

1883
01:34:23.996 --> 01:34:27.198
Yeong-mi has lost her way
and chose Boa as well.

1884
01:34:27.682 --> 01:34:30.596
(Breaking news: Miss Squid, Kim
Yeong-mi was dressing up as a female)

1885
01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:32.640
I thought something was up with you.

1886
01:34:34.191 --> 01:34:35.870
Let's look at the results!

1887
01:34:36.941 --> 01:34:42.402
Who will be the lucky guy that
steals Director Lee's heart?

1888
01:34:42.909 --> 01:34:47.034
Please start disqualifying the
guys you don't like first.

1889
01:34:47.202 --> 01:34:48.202
(Sighing)

1890
01:34:48.394 --> 01:34:50.667
I always have great first impressions

1891
01:34:51.222 --> 01:34:53.066
(Ho-dong is disqualified)

1892
01:34:53.265 --> 01:34:55.066
(Yeong-mi is disqualified)

1893
01:34:55.258 --> 01:34:56.971
(Sang-yeob is disqualified)

1894
01:34:56.996 --> 01:34:58.690
(Sang-min is disqualified)

1895
01:34:58.715 --> 01:35:00.734
I thought he'd last until the end.

1896
01:35:01.074 --> 01:35:04.393
- Let's see who Boa chooses.
- Anyone can see Kyung-hoon will win.

1897
01:35:04.418 --> 01:35:07.315
- Jang-hoon might win.
- No one knows what will happen.

1898
01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:09.120
I think Jang-hoon is hoping to win.

1899
01:35:09.277 --> 01:35:10.495
Get ready!

1900
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:14.894
- Please make your final decision! - Ask
if Director Lee is sincere in her choice.

1901
01:35:15.152 --> 01:35:17.230
Please make your final decision!

1902
01:35:17.332 --> 01:35:19.455
Ask
if Director Lee is sincere in her choice.

1903
01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.792
She's sincere.

1904
01:35:20.941 --> 01:35:22.597
- She's sincere.
- No way!

1905
01:35:23.433 --> 01:35:25.339
- She's sincere.
- No way!

1906
01:35:25.831 --> 01:35:27.525
(Boa chooses Jang-hoon)

1907
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:28.800
You scared me!

1908
01:35:29.847 --> 01:35:33.337
Wouldn't it have been better to lose in the
first round, if this was going to happen?

1909
01:35:33.362 --> 01:35:36.159
(Zero Award, Kerang, Kerang, Zero Award)

1910
01:35:36.184 --> 01:35:37.776
How can this be true?

1911
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:40.526
(Final couple: Boa and Jang-hoon)

1912
01:35:42.058 --> 01:35:45.021
Seriously? I'm seriously going to go crazy!

1913
01:35:48.983 --> 01:35:51.767
- This is Boa's new song!
- You're driving me insane.

1914
01:35:51.792 --> 01:35:55.618
(The first-time showing her new song)

1915
01:36:09.996 --> 01:36:13.025
(Boa is Asia's start forever)

1916
01:36:14.415 --> 01:36:17.181
(Next: Previews of transfer students,
Lee Da-hee and Han Hyun-min)

1917
01:36:17.261 --> 01:36:20.509
(A model the world focuses
on: Han Hyun-min)

1918
01:36:20.847 --> 01:36:23.466
The Olympic torch is approaching us.

1919
01:36:23.776 --> 01:36:25.862
I'm a real high-school student.

1920
01:36:26.784 --> 01:36:30.661
Ho-dong is like large pottery
crocks at my grandma's house.

1921
01:36:32.684 --> 01:36:35.989
You could walk the runways
if you're that funny.

1922
01:36:36.962 --> 01:36:38.927
(Meal service dance!)

1923
01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.893
I grow taller with my hair. I'm 6'3" now.

1924
01:36:44.091 --> 01:36:46.556
(Innocent Hyun-min put a trance
on the 'Ask Us Anything' members)

1925
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:49.072
I can sing and dance. There
isn't anything I can't do.

1926
01:36:49.097 --> 01:36:50.372
You can dance?

1927
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:53.435
(Refreshing)

1928
01:36:54.277 --> 01:36:57.122
(Lovely Da-hee's "Likey" performance)

1929
01:36:57.697 --> 01:37:00.026
(I fell in love)

1930
01:37:00.354 --> 01:37:03.143
- Stop laughing.
- No one was laughing!

1931
01:37:03.565 --> 01:37:06.190
- Good job!
- Is there anyone you're interested here?

1932
01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:07.624
Seo Jang-hoon!

1933
01:37:08.182 --> 01:37:09.572
- Really?
- Me?

1934
01:37:09.597 --> 01:37:11.909
(I'm your bodyguard. And Da-hee!)

1935
01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.026
Come after you wear 7" heels.

1936
01:37:14.159 --> 01:37:16.499
(A romance only a giant can dream)

1937
01:37:16.776 --> 01:37:19.407
(Will Jang-hoon and Da-hee be
able to become love bodyguards?)

1938
01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.744
- Isn't this the broadcasting room?
- Yeah, it is.

1939
01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:24.190
When did you feel like
you were the happiest?

1940
01:37:24.284 --> 01:37:26.002
The moment I met you.

1941
01:37:26.206 --> 01:37:29.151
- I was there...
- You're being tapped!

1942
01:37:29.862 --> 01:37:34.002
After sharply walking, the students
began shouting in unison, "Eba Seba".

1943
01:37:34.331 --> 01:37:36.620
May I take a Polaroid of you?

1944
01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:39.490
(There isn't a day when the
broadcasting room is quiet)

1945
01:37:39.515 --> 01:37:41.073
Look over here, please!

1946
01:37:41.325 --> 01:37:43.845
("Ask Us Anything". Every
Saturday night at 8:50)

1947
01:37:45.869 --> 01:37:47.869
