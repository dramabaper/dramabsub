(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:11.194
There's nothing between me and Do Kyung.

4
00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.504
There has never been, and not even now.

5
00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:16.133
And that would never happen...

6
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:18.234
even in the future.

7
00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:21.603
There's nothing I want from Do Kyung either.

8
00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:25.074
Especially, I'd never want to go back...

9
00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:28.844
to the Haesung family.

10
00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:30.754
What?

11
00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:34.354
I don't want that.

12
00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:37.954
You "don't want" that?

13
00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:42.693
I think I don't belong there.

14
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.434
How dare you.

15
00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:47.934
It's better for me to stay away from your family,

16
00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.833
but I'm not that shameless...

17
00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:54.004
to hurt your family again.

18
00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:58.674
Then tell me where Do Kyung is. Where is he?

19
00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:01.083
I'm sorry,

20
00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:04.713
but I have no right to tell you that.

21
00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:07.624
Since I told you nothing is between him and me,

22
00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.993
it would be fair for me to tell you my thoughts only.

23
00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:13.663
Do you want me to believe...

24
00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:16.963
that Do Kyung likes you even though you don't?

25
00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.933
Why did you rush here when you heard I was here then?

26
00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:22.704
I work around this area.

27
00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.404
From what I heard, I thought it would be you.

28
00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:28.943
My curiosity got better of me.

29
00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:29.943
Of course,

30
00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:32.614
I wouldn't have come if I knew you were still here.

31
00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:36.514
I didn't want to have an uncomfortable meeting.

32
00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:40.154
You were planning to hide behind Do Kyung.

33
00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:42.954
That's not true.

34
00:01:43.693 --> 00:01:45.794
I already told you there's nothing between us.

35
00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:49.523
You know he left home because of you,

36
00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:51.734
so you probably know his number. However,

37
00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:53.963
you can't tell me where he is.

38
00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:55.963
Despite all this, there's nothing between you two?

39
00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:00.704
You don't want anything related to Haesung.

40
00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:03.014
You don't like my family.

41
00:02:03.713 --> 00:02:05.273
<v ->Is that what you mean? - Yes.</v>

42
00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:10.384
There's nothing I can do about your disbelief.

43
00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:13.724
But since I told you the truth about my feelings,

44
00:02:14.924 --> 00:02:16.753
I'd like to ask you not to visit my parents...

45
00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:21.724
regarding matters with Mr. Choi Do Kyung.

46
00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.993
<v ->Please don't. - Then send Do Kyung back.</v>

47
00:02:27.164 --> 00:02:28.833
If what you are telling me is the truth,

48
00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:31.974
send him back home now. Then I'll believe you.

49
00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:35.273
I believe that's out of my hands.

50
00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:39.313
It's his life. He will make his own decisions.

51
00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:43.213
I don't want to cross paths with you...

52
00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.924
for any matters regarding him.

53
00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:50.093
You...

54
00:02:51.123 --> 00:02:52.924
You are quite daring.

55
00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.093
I apologize.

56
00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:57.764
You didn't even ask how I knew he liked you.

57
00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:04.134
I'm aware that you always get your answers.

58
00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:09.713
Exactly. That's the power I have. Don't forget that.

59
00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:12.373
I won't.

60
00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:15.514
Tell Do Kyung to come see me.

61
00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:20.053
If I run into him, I will relay the message.

62
00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:25.523
Since I don't know what is going on inside your head,

63
00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:28.794
your claim of indifference means nothing.

64
00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:32.794
Don't you...

65
00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.164
dare dream about having Do Kyung, Ji An.

66
00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:38.803
I won't.

67
00:03:45.674 --> 00:03:47.313
If you finished what you meant to say to me,

68
00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:49.653
may I leave now?

69
00:04:28.183 --> 00:04:30.053
How could she be so bold?

70
00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:48.503
Are you all right, Ji An?

71
00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:51.643
You look pale.

72
00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:56.284
What happened? You said she left.

73
00:04:57.914 --> 00:04:59.654
I thought she did.

74
00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:01.854
She's no match for anyone.

75
00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:06.893
Ji An, you'll come over now?

76
00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:13.164
Ji An. Ji An...

77
00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:17.073
I guess I can wait.

78
00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:28.683
Two cups of Americano.

79
00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:43.594
Don't come now. She came back.

80
00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:49.834
(Hee)

81
00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:52.133
(Don't come now. She came back.)

82
00:05:54.174 --> 00:05:56.174
I didn't know since my phone was on silent mode.

83
00:05:57.513 --> 00:06:00.584
Do Kyung was the son of the Haesung family?

84
00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:03.854
She was one charismatic woman.

85
00:06:05.354 --> 00:06:07.253
What will you do now, Ji An?

86
00:06:08.984 --> 00:06:11.193
So that's why Hyuk...

87
00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:13.964
was so worried about you.

88
00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:17.594
Hee, don't tell Hyuk about this.

89
00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:19.234
I'll handle this by myself.

90
00:06:30.743 --> 00:06:32.873
I like the fact that you can manufacture...

91
00:06:32.873 --> 00:06:34.544
both injection and extrusion moldings.

92
00:06:34.943 --> 00:06:36.683
I will contact you after I discuss...

93
00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:39.154
the conditions of the production with the boss.

94
00:06:39.414 --> 00:06:41.953
We're short of work now, so we can take your order.

95
00:06:42.823 --> 00:06:45.193
Thank you. I'll wait for your call.

96
00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:08.484
It was Seo Ji An.

97
00:07:08.683 --> 00:07:10.654
The woman Do Kyung likes is Seo Ji An.

98
00:07:11.383 --> 00:07:13.024
How did you find that out?

99
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.253
Thinking back, she was the only one in his life.

100
00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:21.263
Aren't you surprised?

101
00:07:22.224 --> 00:07:23.993
It's a relief if it's Seo Ji An.

102
00:07:24.164 --> 00:07:25.594
"It's a relief"?

103
00:07:25.993 --> 00:07:29.563
Dad might really disown him if it's Seo Ji An.

104
00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:31.534
He will be even more disappointed in us...

105
00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.643
for bringing her in and causing him to like her.

106
00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:36.174
That won't happen.

107
00:07:36.844 --> 00:07:39.174
Ji An won't let it get that far.

108
00:07:39.513 --> 00:07:41.614
How do you know that?

109
00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:44.614
She wasn't rude, and she was smart.

110
00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:47.284
She knows best how ill-fated...

111
00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:48.854
our families are.

112
00:07:49.623 --> 00:07:52.854
But she wouldn't tell us where he is.

113
00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:54.763
Did you meet with her?

114
00:07:55.664 --> 00:07:57.364
I just met her.

115
00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:00.364
I couldn't tell if she was smart...

116
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:04.073
in an innocent way or trying to trick us.

117
00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:08.373
I couldn't read her thoughts.

118
00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:10.743
We'll find out once he comes back.

119
00:08:11.443 --> 00:08:14.544
She didn't even give me his number.

120
00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:16.614
She will tell him about your visit.

121
00:08:18.953 --> 00:08:20.284
She will, won't she?

122
00:08:21.654 --> 00:08:22.953
Even if she doesn't,

123
00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:26.424
you'll make sure Do Kyung comes back home.

124
00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:42.143
I don't know what's wrong with me

125
00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:46.444
Usually, this has to do with love. Who is she?

126
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:48.814
<v ->Yong Gook. - Yes?</v>

127
00:08:49.913 --> 00:08:51.984
Ji Soo is acting strange all of a sudden.

128
00:08:52.954 --> 00:08:54.123
But...

129
00:08:54.653 --> 00:08:55.954
I'm acting strange too.

130
00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:58.824
No way. Did you find that out just now?

131
00:08:58.824 --> 00:09:00.564
It's been so long since you started to act weird.

132
00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:04.094
<v ->It's been going on long? - Yes.</v>

133
00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:06.503
You are confused, aren't you?

134
00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:10.633
"I decided to like Ji An a long time ago,"

135
00:09:10.773 --> 00:09:13.304
"but why do I keep thinking about Ji Soo?"

136
00:09:14.444 --> 00:09:17.673
On Christmas Eve, Ji An was inside,

137
00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:19.684
but you kept looking outside.

138
00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:22.543
You were waiting for her, right?

139
00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:24.954
Yes, that. That's it.

140
00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:29.084
When you met Ji An, you said it was fate.

141
00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:30.423
That was a load of nonsense.

142
00:09:30.523 --> 00:09:31.724
"Nonsense"?

143
00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:35.224
Why is that nonsense? She was my first love.

144
00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:37.834
Exactly. That. "First love".

145
00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:39.464
First love from 10 years ago.

146
00:09:40.503 --> 00:09:42.763
Do you think it's possible...

147
00:09:42.763 --> 00:09:45.273
to like someone after 10 years?

148
00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:49.743
You're caught under the idea of first love.

149
00:09:50.543 --> 00:09:52.074
"The idea of first love"?

150
00:09:52.214 --> 00:09:54.143
You and I are like brothers,

151
00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:56.614
but Do Kyung and I are estranged friends.

152
00:09:56.984 --> 00:09:59.253
If I thought that you really liked her,

153
00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:01.123
do you think I'd let him stay at the share house?

154
00:10:02.523 --> 00:10:04.194
He's the enemy of my brother.

155
00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:06.023
Yong Gook.

156
00:10:06.324 --> 00:10:07.763
You thought that far ahead?

157
00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:11.293
Besides, you knew Ji An likes Do Kyung.

158
00:10:11.493 --> 00:10:13.003
But you weren't jealous.

159
00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:14.464
You only worried about her...

160
00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:16.633
like a brother or an uncle.

161
00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:20.474
It's because what she went through is unimaginable.

162
00:10:21.173 --> 00:10:22.844
The girl you keep worrying about,

163
00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:24.513
and the girl you can't stop thinking about.

164
00:10:24.873 --> 00:10:26.074
Who do you think you are in love with?

165
00:10:28.043 --> 00:10:31.013
You've been worried about too many people.

166
00:10:32.954 --> 00:10:34.783
Stop pretending to take care of everybody.

167
00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:36.454
Even without you,

168
00:10:37.153 --> 00:10:39.354
they find their own ways when the right time comes.

169
00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:42.094
Have I been pretending?

170
00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:45.263
You've been the breadwinner...

171
00:10:45.263 --> 00:10:46.403
since you were young,

172
00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:48.263
and I liked you for your sense of responsibility.

173
00:10:48.263 --> 00:10:50.373
It's my sister. Just a moment.

174
00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:53.643
Yes, Hee.

175
00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:56.314
Hyuk, can you come to the cafe?

176
00:10:56.543 --> 00:10:59.373
Do Kyung's mother came to see Ji An.

177
00:10:59.373 --> 00:11:00.844
Do Kyung's mother?

178
00:11:02.783 --> 00:11:05.013
Did she say how she found out about it?

179
00:11:05.984 --> 00:11:07.584
She didn't say it,

180
00:11:07.883 --> 00:11:09.653
and Ji An didn't ask.

181
00:11:11.194 --> 00:11:12.393
But Hyuk,

182
00:11:13.094 --> 00:11:14.824
Do Kyung's mother...

183
00:11:15.023 --> 00:11:17.064
looked really feisty and scary.

184
00:11:17.564 --> 00:11:19.704
But Ji An was very calm.

185
00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:23.773
She knew she'd meet her one day.

186
00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:27.673
The day you brought Ji An to the house,

187
00:11:28.273 --> 00:11:30.074
she was all lethargic.

188
00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:33.314
It had something to do with her, didn't it?

189
00:11:35.283 --> 00:11:37.054
Was she...

190
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.724
in a relationship with Do Kyung?

191
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.023
That's not it.

192
00:11:42.224 --> 00:11:44.923
I can't tell you more about Ji An's business.

193
00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:46.464
Pretend you don't know.

194
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.364
Don't ask Ji An questions.

195
00:11:48.623 --> 00:11:49.763
I won't.

196
00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:51.893
The same goes for you too.

197
00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:55.434
Ji An told me not to tell you.

198
00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:58.574
But I thought you should know.

199
00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:03.273
She doesn't want to bother me.

200
00:12:05.013 --> 00:12:07.684
(Waffle Restaurant Franchise Contract)

201
00:12:10.954 --> 00:12:13.224
Now, I am a businessman too.

202
00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.554
I will make it work out no matter what.

203
00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:25.464
Whatever business you want to run,

204
00:12:25.864 --> 00:12:27.934
you have to work at a similar business...

205
00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:29.163
for at least a year.

206
00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:33.074
Don't think about starting with a franchise.

207
00:12:35.743 --> 00:12:37.243
He's worried for no reason.

208
00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:43.184
Dad, what's wrong?

209
00:12:44.753 --> 00:12:46.484
Why... Why are you vomiting?

210
00:12:46.554 --> 00:12:47.554
It... It's nothing.

211
00:12:47.554 --> 00:12:50.493
I just drank coffee on an empty stomach.

212
00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:52.993
My gosh.

213
00:12:53.293 --> 00:12:55.793
He should've told me that he hadn't eaten.

214
00:13:16.584 --> 00:13:19.283
How much did you practice? You improved so quickly.

215
00:13:19.513 --> 00:13:22.153
I just did it to kill time.

216
00:13:22.153 --> 00:13:24.694
No way. I'm sure you used to play it before.

217
00:13:26.423 --> 00:13:28.663
It was a tree I couldn't climb...

218
00:13:29.094 --> 00:13:31.263
and a dream I couldn't dare to have.

219
00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:33.864
Everyone once had a dream, right?

220
00:13:34.503 --> 00:13:36.373
There are a lot of people like you.

221
00:13:36.373 --> 00:13:38.273
A lot of people learn to play an instrument...

222
00:13:38.273 --> 00:13:39.704
after they retire.

223
00:13:39.873 --> 00:13:41.704
I should introduce you to a hobby group.

224
00:13:41.704 --> 00:13:43.743
That's okay.

225
00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:46.243
Right. You said you were going somewhere.

226
00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:47.643
How long will you be gone for?

227
00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:49.684
You should come back when you're back.

228
00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:53.623
How could he vomit...

229
00:13:53.623 --> 00:13:56.554
after just a sip of coffee on an empty stomach?

230
00:13:57.393 --> 00:13:59.623
I think Dad is not well.

231
00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:02.464
Okay. I will ask him.

232
00:14:04.533 --> 00:14:06.334
I will call you. Okay.

233
00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:12.204
(Soo A)

234
00:14:12.204 --> 00:14:13.543
When are you getting off work?

235
00:14:16.413 --> 00:14:17.714
I can get off early.

236
00:14:34.793 --> 00:14:36.263
What's that?

237
00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:38.993
I packed in the morning and left.

238
00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:41.334
We can't keep on fighting...

239
00:14:41.834 --> 00:14:44.273
when your parents are around.

240
00:14:46.643 --> 00:14:48.574
I'll be staying at Seung Hun's place.

241
00:14:48.903 --> 00:14:49.974
What?

242
00:14:50.513 --> 00:14:51.814
Please tell your parents...

243
00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:54.614
that I had to go to a seminar.

244
00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:58.084
Soo A.

245
00:14:58.084 --> 00:14:59.383
If you come with me...

246
00:15:00.153 --> 00:15:01.954
to the hospital on the day of the surgery,

247
00:15:02.954 --> 00:15:04.694
we will be going home together.

248
00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:06.623
But if you don't come,

249
00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:09.163
I will consider the divorce paper signed.

250
00:15:09.163 --> 00:15:10.864
Did you even give it a thought?

251
00:15:11.094 --> 00:15:13.763
Did you hear the baby's heartbeat?

252
00:15:13.763 --> 00:15:15.564
I know that I am committing a sin.

253
00:15:16.434 --> 00:15:18.434
But a child is no toy.

254
00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:20.704
I have to give birth and raise that child.

255
00:15:20.704 --> 00:15:23.074
Nobody has the right to tell me what to do.

256
00:15:23.474 --> 00:15:26.143
Nobody has the right to tell me what to do...

257
00:15:27.184 --> 00:15:28.383
because this is my situation.

258
00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:31.214
So? Are you telling me...

259
00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:33.554
to choose between you and the baby?

260
00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:38.023
Think about why you didn't want to get married...

261
00:15:38.753 --> 00:15:40.824
or have a baby.

262
00:15:42.194 --> 00:15:43.834
Think about it once more.

263
00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:48.464
I will send you the booking confirmation.

264
00:15:49.834 --> 00:15:50.873
Take care.

265
00:16:39.554 --> 00:16:40.623
Ji An.

266
00:16:42.684 --> 00:16:43.753
Aren't you going home?

267
00:16:43.993 --> 00:16:45.653
We have to switch rooms today.

268
00:16:46.194 --> 00:16:48.163
You should go first. I have more things to do.

269
00:16:48.523 --> 00:16:51.163
I packed all my things and put it in Hee's room.

270
00:16:51.334 --> 00:16:52.834
You can use your room now.

271
00:16:53.234 --> 00:16:54.464
How was the class?

272
00:16:56.263 --> 00:16:58.503
It was fun. It's fun.

273
00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:01.804
Ji An told me not to tell you.

274
00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:05.014
But I thought you should know.

275
00:17:06.544 --> 00:17:08.114
I'll go home then. See you later at home.

276
00:17:08.114 --> 00:17:09.754
<v ->Okay. See you later. - Okay.</v>

277
00:17:23.994 --> 00:17:25.163
Stop.

278
00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:29.034
What are you doing?

279
00:17:29.334 --> 00:17:31.034
Why are you trying to go inside that room?

280
00:17:31.804 --> 00:17:33.873
Ji An moved to your sister's room.

281
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:36.104
So I am going to use the room Ji An used.

282
00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:44.683
What are you doing right now?

283
00:17:45.153 --> 00:17:47.284
You can just use this room.

284
00:17:47.623 --> 00:17:50.294
The room Ji An was using is originally my room.

285
00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:53.463
This is a share house. You can't own a room.

286
00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:54.564
But I can.

287
00:17:54.564 --> 00:17:55.994
You get to choose a room by the entry order.

288
00:17:56.163 --> 00:17:59.233
But can't we change rooms if it's necessary?

289
00:17:59.233 --> 00:18:01.504
Do you hate the fact that I will be using...

290
00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:02.703
the room Ji An used?

291
00:18:02.703 --> 00:18:05.074
That's one reason. But...

292
00:18:05.873 --> 00:18:08.673
I just want to use Ji An's room.

293
00:18:09.443 --> 00:18:11.143
You're not even sure about how long you'll stay here.

294
00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:15.943
Do Kyung.

295
00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:18.713
It's not the time to fuss over this.

296
00:18:19.413 --> 00:18:21.883
Your mother visited Ji An.

297
00:18:22.383 --> 00:18:23.393
What?

298
00:18:39.534 --> 00:18:40.604
Hey.

299
00:18:41.104 --> 00:18:42.673
What a coincidence.

300
00:18:43.614 --> 00:18:45.913
I was hungry, so I came out to buy some snacks.

301
00:18:46.544 --> 00:18:47.584
I see.

302
00:18:48.913 --> 00:18:51.284
By the way, you come home way too late.

303
00:18:51.284 --> 00:18:52.554
It's dangerous at night.

304
00:18:54.854 --> 00:18:55.983
You're eating a steamed bun.

305
00:18:56.854 --> 00:18:58.324
You eat this too now?

306
00:19:00.794 --> 00:19:03.034
Here. It's a vegetable bun.

307
00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:05.994
Thank you.

308
00:19:08.733 --> 00:19:09.774
And...

309
00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:12.203
here. Take this too.

310
00:19:14.304 --> 00:19:16.173
I used it well. Thank you.

311
00:19:18.274 --> 00:19:19.913
If Mother met you already,

312
00:19:20.643 --> 00:19:22.983
there's no point in hiding where I am.

313
00:19:25.383 --> 00:19:26.923
Why didn't you call me right away?

314
00:19:28.453 --> 00:19:30.554
You said you were meeting a lot of investors today.

315
00:19:32.223 --> 00:19:33.623
So you waited because you didn't want to...

316
00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:35.393
interrupt my work.

317
00:19:36.864 --> 00:19:39.264
It wasn't an urgent matter anyway.

318
00:19:40.663 --> 00:19:42.973
She said you should come and meet her.

319
00:19:44.973 --> 00:19:46.074
How...

320
00:19:46.703 --> 00:19:48.673
did Mother find out?

321
00:19:50.244 --> 00:19:52.643
She didn't ask me, and I didn't ask her.

322
00:19:55.483 --> 00:19:56.814
Didn't you get curious?

323
00:19:58.983 --> 00:20:00.054
I didn't.

324
00:20:01.423 --> 00:20:03.123
What did you talk about?

325
00:20:05.094 --> 00:20:06.794
You should hear it from her.

326
00:20:07.064 --> 00:20:09.364
I told her everything about where I stand...

327
00:20:09.794 --> 00:20:11.094
and what I think.

328
00:20:12.064 --> 00:20:13.233
Don't worry.

329
00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:15.903
It happened earlier than I expected.

330
00:20:16.604 --> 00:20:18.133
But I will take care of it.

331
00:20:19.804 --> 00:20:21.703
I couldn't hide it for a long time anyway.

332
00:20:22.443 --> 00:20:23.943
And I didn't want to hide it either.

333
00:20:25.744 --> 00:20:27.614
I almost finished finding the OEM factory,

334
00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:29.784
and I reduced the budget significantly.

335
00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:31.913
They said they would invest...

336
00:20:31.913 --> 00:20:33.153
if I reduce the budget.

337
00:20:35.483 --> 00:20:36.693
I will get the investment soon...

338
00:20:37.294 --> 00:20:38.653
and stand on my own feet.

339
00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:40.923
Trust me.

340
00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:46.233
This is good.

341
00:21:00.413 --> 00:21:01.443
Goodnight.

342
00:21:18.334 --> 00:21:19.703
I can do it.

343
00:21:20.703 --> 00:21:22.463
I can do it. I can do it.

344
00:21:23.703 --> 00:21:25.133
Are you joining a competition?

345
00:21:25.133 --> 00:21:26.133
No.

346
00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.574
I was just making a resolution.

347
00:21:32.643 --> 00:21:35.014
You got dumped, haven't you?

348
00:21:35.314 --> 00:21:36.413
What... What?

349
00:21:36.413 --> 00:21:38.713
What are you saying?

350
00:21:39.554 --> 00:21:41.383
I heard you cry a few days ago,

351
00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:42.584
your eyes were all swollen,

352
00:21:42.584 --> 00:21:44.324
and you were always zoned out.

353
00:21:46.564 --> 00:21:48.693
I've experienced that too.

354
00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:51.594
Was it that obvious?

355
00:21:52.494 --> 00:21:55.864
Are you telling yourself that you can forget him?

356
00:21:56.903 --> 00:21:58.004
Yes.

357
00:21:58.604 --> 00:22:01.104
I am practicing to forget him in a cool way.

358
00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:03.943
I am going to wish for his happiness.

359
00:22:05.014 --> 00:22:07.614
You're going to wish for his happiness too?

360
00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:10.413
"I don't like you at all."

361
00:22:11.483 --> 00:22:14.824
"I am not interested in you at all."

362
00:22:16.324 --> 00:22:18.854
"So I hope you end up to be with the person..."

363
00:22:20.193 --> 00:22:21.524
"you've been liking for so long."

364
00:22:32.703 --> 00:22:34.274
Why did you get up so early?

365
00:22:35.943 --> 00:22:37.643
I was going to wake you up after I finished this.

366
00:22:38.673 --> 00:22:41.443
You surprised me. I thought you were gone.

367
00:22:42.614 --> 00:22:44.014
I am not going anywhere.

368
00:22:44.514 --> 00:22:47.254
I will always be where you can see me.

369
00:22:47.524 --> 00:22:48.554
Okay?

370
00:22:51.254 --> 00:22:54.123
What are you cooking? I told you not to do this.

371
00:22:54.223 --> 00:22:56.024
I can't sleep in.

372
00:22:56.693 --> 00:23:00.334
Today's breakfast is beef radish soup.

373
00:23:01.804 --> 00:23:03.334
I am going to cook tomorrow's breakfast.

374
00:23:03.334 --> 00:23:05.004
<v ->Don't get up before me. - Hey, that tickles.</v>

375
00:23:05.004 --> 00:23:06.443
Stop it. Seriously.

376
00:23:06.574 --> 00:23:09.604
Stop it. It tickles. It really tickles.

377
00:23:13.713 --> 00:23:14.713
Let's eat.

378
00:23:20.683 --> 00:23:21.854
Hello.

379
00:23:21.854 --> 00:23:23.094
You're here early today.

380
00:23:23.623 --> 00:23:25.354
You're a good assistant.

381
00:23:25.354 --> 00:23:28.423
I'm glad you're here. I will drop her off.

382
00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:30.064
Please pack the breads when they're done.

383
00:23:30.594 --> 00:23:32.494
I will make you a cup of coffee in return.

384
00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.834
Don't worry and enjoy your morning date.

385
00:23:34.834 --> 00:23:36.834
<v ->Thank you. - Let's go.</v>

386
00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:38.104
You should put on your winter jacket.

387
00:23:38.104 --> 00:23:39.104
Oh, my winter jacket.

388
00:23:40.443 --> 00:23:41.774
Okay. Let's hurry.

389
00:23:45.643 --> 00:23:46.913
I envy them.

390
00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:49.814
We're not open...

391
00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.324
Nam Goo isn't here.

392
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:59.193
He went to drop Hee off at her cafe.

393
00:23:59.893 --> 00:24:01.494
Then we can talk here.

394
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:04.233
I just couldn't understand.

395
00:24:05.193 --> 00:24:07.133
Why are you suddenly doing this to me, Ji Soo?

396
00:24:08.463 --> 00:24:09.633
What did I do?

397
00:24:09.774 --> 00:24:12.604
You said you didn't like me. Why did you say that?

398
00:24:12.873 --> 00:24:15.104
I've always been the same.

399
00:24:17.344 --> 00:24:19.373
Did I do something wrong to you?

400
00:24:23.284 --> 00:24:26.354
I didn't know you were this slow.

401
00:24:27.054 --> 00:24:28.084
What?

402
00:24:28.254 --> 00:24:30.854
I told you that there's no reason for it.

403
00:24:38.233 --> 00:24:39.233
No.

404
00:24:40.334 --> 00:24:41.633
There is a reason.

405
00:24:42.463 --> 00:24:45.274
People's feelings don't change overnight.

406
00:24:48.104 --> 00:24:49.673
It's just because I got a boyfriend.

407
00:24:52.473 --> 00:24:54.084
It's not that I don't like you.

408
00:24:54.443 --> 00:24:56.784
I'm just not attracted to you.

409
00:24:56.883 --> 00:25:00.683
I think you are a good person.

410
00:25:02.623 --> 00:25:04.153
You got a boyfriend?

411
00:25:04.354 --> 00:25:05.393
Yes.

412
00:25:06.094 --> 00:25:08.494
He's been chasing after me for a while.

413
00:25:13.004 --> 00:25:14.433
By the way, Mr. Sunwoo,

414
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:17.304
is it wrong for a girl like me to not like you?

415
00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:23.514
I have to bring out the bread. Bye.

416
00:25:41.923 --> 00:25:43.294
Aren't you going to the office today?

417
00:25:46.403 --> 00:25:48.104
I think Do Kyung will show up.

418
00:25:49.973 --> 00:25:51.504
He won't be able to come to the office,

419
00:25:51.504 --> 00:25:53.004
so I thought he would come home.

420
00:25:57.114 --> 00:25:58.173
He is...

421
00:25:58.173 --> 00:25:59.173
(Choi Do Kyung)

422
00:25:59.173 --> 00:26:00.683
using his phone again.

423
00:26:01.443 --> 00:26:02.443
How about you?

424
00:26:03.054 --> 00:26:04.054
I have a meeting.

425
00:26:22.633 --> 00:26:23.834
I'm here.

426
00:26:26.473 --> 00:26:28.403
She said she wasn't interested in you at all.

427
00:26:28.774 --> 00:26:30.173
But she called you right away, didn't she?

428
00:26:34.913 --> 00:26:36.713
Ji An didn't tell me.

429
00:26:37.854 --> 00:26:39.554
I heard it through someone at the cafe.

430
00:26:40.354 --> 00:26:42.153
I heard you met Ji An.

431
00:26:42.754 --> 00:26:44.294
It's the same thing.

432
00:26:44.294 --> 00:26:46.623
They're all related to Ji An anyway.

433
00:26:47.794 --> 00:26:48.864
By the way,

434
00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:51.294
how did you find out about it?

435
00:26:52.794 --> 00:26:54.203
Ji An said this.

436
00:26:55.163 --> 00:26:57.473
She said that she knew I could find out...

437
00:26:57.473 --> 00:26:58.774
about anything I want to know.

438
00:27:00.104 --> 00:27:01.504
Didn't you know?

439
00:27:01.943 --> 00:27:04.873
Did you not know what Ji An knows?

440
00:27:06.344 --> 00:27:08.383
You must've been very surprised.

441
00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:12.054
I can't believe it.

442
00:27:13.784 --> 00:27:15.623
Ji An won't even accept me,

443
00:27:16.554 --> 00:27:18.653
but still, I left home. It must be surprising.

444
00:27:19.663 --> 00:27:20.723
If you think...

445
00:27:21.163 --> 00:27:22.794
I did it only for Ji An.

446
00:27:22.794 --> 00:27:24.663
Are you talking about your grand plan...

447
00:27:24.663 --> 00:27:25.834
of standing on your own feet...

448
00:27:25.834 --> 00:27:27.104
and starting your own business?

449
00:27:27.663 --> 00:27:29.774
Are you talking about affording to live...

450
00:27:29.873 --> 00:27:32.534
the way you want and find ways to be happy?

451
00:27:33.504 --> 00:27:34.643
Yes.

452
00:27:34.673 --> 00:27:36.274
Would you do that even without Ji An?

453
00:27:39.413 --> 00:27:41.514
Would you have moved out if it weren't for Ji An?

454
00:27:42.014 --> 00:27:44.713
Would you have looked for ways...

455
00:27:44.814 --> 00:27:46.723
to be happy if it weren't for Ji An?

456
00:27:47.723 --> 00:27:48.953
I wouldn't have.

457
00:27:50.054 --> 00:27:52.153
I wanted to be with Ji An while doing so.

458
00:27:54.163 --> 00:27:55.693
In the end, you did it for a woman.

459
00:27:55.693 --> 00:27:57.494
Don't try covering it up.

460
00:27:58.393 --> 00:27:59.463
Do I look funny to you?

461
00:27:59.864 --> 00:28:02.403
Do you think I'd joke around with you?

462
00:28:02.933 --> 00:28:05.873
Mother, you used to approve and like Ji An.

463
00:28:05.933 --> 00:28:08.104
That's when I thought she was my daughter.

464
00:28:08.703 --> 00:28:10.443
I liked her when she was my daughter.

465
00:28:11.143 --> 00:28:12.574
But whose daughter is she?

466
00:28:12.744 --> 00:28:14.844
She's Seo Tae Soo and Yang Mi Jung's daughter.

467
00:28:14.844 --> 00:28:17.514
But that's not Ji An's fault.

468
00:28:17.983 --> 00:28:19.054
What?

469
00:28:19.514 --> 00:28:21.483
Please only consider Ji An herself.

470
00:28:22.354 --> 00:28:24.094
"Ji An herself"?

471
00:28:25.693 --> 00:28:26.893
Why would I?

472
00:28:27.094 --> 00:28:29.564
She doesn't even deserve to be mentioned.

473
00:28:30.193 --> 00:28:31.264
She's become...

474
00:28:32.064 --> 00:28:34.403
very precious to me.

475
00:28:36.034 --> 00:28:37.074
So?

476
00:28:38.004 --> 00:28:40.873
Did you win her over? Are you in a relationship?

477
00:28:45.173 --> 00:28:47.114
Was she telling the truth?

478
00:28:48.383 --> 00:28:49.383
What...

479
00:28:50.284 --> 00:28:51.713
did Ji An say?

480
00:28:51.713 --> 00:28:54.284
"I don't understand either why Do Kyung left home..."

481
00:28:54.284 --> 00:28:55.883
"even though there's nothing."

482
00:28:55.953 --> 00:28:59.354
"So stop yell at me and settle it with your son."

483
00:29:02.193 --> 00:29:04.193
"I never thought of and never will think"

484
00:29:04.193 --> 00:29:06.433
"about getting involved with him."

485
00:29:07.703 --> 00:29:11.304
"There's nothing I want to gain through him."

486
00:29:11.304 --> 00:29:13.344
"I especially have no intention..."

487
00:29:13.344 --> 00:29:16.274
"of joining your family ever again."

488
00:29:21.213 --> 00:29:24.054
She's the one who disapproves our family.

489
00:29:28.754 --> 00:29:30.794
She's so daring and rude.

490
00:29:31.354 --> 00:29:34.494
She spoke clearly without getting intimidated.

491
00:29:36.064 --> 00:29:37.163
If that was a show,

492
00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:39.703
you two must've planned this together.

493
00:29:39.703 --> 00:29:41.933
We didn't do that. Never.

494
00:29:42.163 --> 00:29:44.004
You "never" planned that with her?

495
00:29:44.373 --> 00:29:45.774
Does that mean you ran away from home...

496
00:29:45.774 --> 00:29:47.274
just because of your one-sided love?

497
00:29:47.274 --> 00:29:48.844
You, the successor of Haesung Corporation?

498
00:29:49.203 --> 00:29:52.014
Have you lost your mind? How does this make sense?

499
00:29:53.044 --> 00:29:54.883
Are you really my son, Do Kyung?

500
00:29:55.014 --> 00:29:58.114
I haven't changed my mind about living my life...

501
00:29:58.114 --> 00:29:59.153
the way I want.

502
00:30:00.453 --> 00:30:01.483
I couldn't tell you...

503
00:30:01.483 --> 00:30:02.754
because Ji An didn't approve it.

504
00:30:04.324 --> 00:30:05.623
But even if I had told you,

505
00:30:05.923 --> 00:30:07.463
you wouldn't have approved my plan.

506
00:30:07.963 --> 00:30:09.864
So I came up with my own way.

507
00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:12.764
But you found out about it first.

508
00:30:14.163 --> 00:30:15.933
Now that I know it, you should come back...

509
00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:17.203
before your grandfather finds out about it.

510
00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:19.304
Now that I know,

511
00:30:19.703 --> 00:30:21.173
I won't leave you alone.

512
00:30:21.173 --> 00:30:23.143
Now that you know I like her alone,

513
00:30:23.973 --> 00:30:26.074
you don't have to see Ji An again.

514
00:30:27.084 --> 00:30:29.913
I left home without money as Grandfather wanted,

515
00:30:31.584 --> 00:30:32.653
so you don't...

516
00:30:33.223 --> 00:30:35.324
have the right to force me to come back home either.

517
00:30:36.494 --> 00:30:37.494
What?

518
00:30:38.524 --> 00:30:40.163
I should get going then.

519
00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:46.334
I'll see you later. Please take care.

How...

527
00:31:31.114 --> 00:31:33.114
did she know?

528
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:36.983
She didn't tell me and I didn't ask her.

529
00:31:38.213 --> 00:31:39.754
What did she say?

530
00:31:40.683 --> 00:31:42.254
You should hear it from her.

531
00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:45.094
I told her everything about where I stand...

532
00:31:45.453 --> 00:31:46.864
and what I think.

00:32:18.153 --> 00:32:19.254
I see.

538
00:32:21.564 --> 00:32:22.794
What...

539
00:32:23.633 --> 00:32:25.233
did you tell her?

540
00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:28.963
I don't think...

541
00:32:28.963 --> 00:32:31.433
she would've told you what I didn't say.

542
00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:33.544
She knew you'd ask me that like this.

543
00:32:34.574 --> 00:32:37.614
Then did you really say all that?

544
00:32:39.344 --> 00:32:40.943
There's nothing between you and me.

545
00:32:41.683 --> 00:32:43.213
And nothing will happen even in the future.

546
00:32:44.614 --> 00:32:46.114
Did you really have to say that?

547
00:32:48.524 --> 00:32:50.153
It's just how I feel.

548
00:32:50.693 --> 00:32:52.054
I told you before.

549
00:32:53.463 --> 00:32:54.963
It's not that I'm afraid.

550
00:32:55.963 --> 00:32:57.133
I don't like it.

551
00:32:57.693 --> 00:32:59.334
You live in a completely different world...

552
00:32:59.334 --> 00:33:00.703
where I don't belong.

553
00:33:01.233 --> 00:33:02.334
So...

554
00:33:04.203 --> 00:33:06.473
I don't want to go back there ever again.

555
00:33:06.673 --> 00:33:08.143
This is my decision.

556
00:33:08.744 --> 00:33:10.614
My decision for my own life.

557
00:33:11.044 --> 00:33:12.344
There's...

558
00:33:13.014 --> 00:33:15.244
another world that I can't see.

559
00:33:16.183 --> 00:33:17.483
It is...

560
00:33:18.354 --> 00:33:20.254
different from my world.

561
00:33:20.423 --> 00:33:21.453
I can't...

562
00:33:22.554 --> 00:33:24.594
be happy in that world.

563
00:33:27.594 --> 00:33:28.923
Couldn't you trust me...

564
00:33:28.923 --> 00:33:30.764
and pluck up your courage?

565
00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:33.304
You could've avoided it...

566
00:33:33.304 --> 00:33:34.334
by telling her...

567
00:33:34.663 --> 00:33:36.334
to ask me about everything.

568
00:33:38.004 --> 00:33:39.643
To ask you about it?

569
00:33:40.873 --> 00:33:42.304
What's that supposed to mean?

570
00:33:43.014 --> 00:33:45.143
That means I will accept you.

571
00:33:46.114 --> 00:33:47.713
I'm trying hard here.

572
00:33:48.143 --> 00:33:49.443
I'm trying real hard.

573
00:33:49.754 --> 00:33:50.953
I left home,

574
00:33:50.953 --> 00:33:52.314
and I'm trying to stand on my own feet.

575
00:33:52.314 --> 00:33:54.584
I'm doing all this because of you.

576
00:33:54.653 --> 00:33:56.854
Can't you see that? You know it.

577
00:33:57.123 --> 00:33:58.354
You know everything.

578
00:33:58.354 --> 00:34:00.064
I know. I really do.

579
00:34:01.824 --> 00:34:03.233
But I just can't understand this.

580
00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:06.463
If your heart is in the right place...

581
00:34:07.104 --> 00:34:09.503
and you're trying hard because of me,

582
00:34:10.434 --> 00:34:13.144
do I have to follow your wish? Why?

583
00:34:13.144 --> 00:34:14.704
Because you like me too.

584
00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:17.273
Because we're in the same place.

585
00:34:18.574 --> 00:34:21.383
I like you, but I won't do anything with you.

586
00:34:21.614 --> 00:34:24.483
I'm right here. Why can't you do that?

587
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:27.253
I'm right here to protect you.

588
00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:29.693
I'm working hard to stand on my own feet...

589
00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:31.894
to be independent of my parents and grandfather.

590
00:34:32.923 --> 00:34:34.764
What do you want to do with me?

591
00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:38.293
Do you want to marry me?

592
00:34:38.894 --> 00:34:39.934
Yes.

593
00:34:41.264 --> 00:34:42.563
That's ridiculous.

594
00:34:44.103 --> 00:34:45.133
What?

595
00:34:45.434 --> 00:34:46.974
I said that's not what I want.

596
00:34:48.374 --> 00:34:50.313
I've been part of your family before.

597
00:34:50.673 --> 00:34:52.943
So I know the rules of your family.

598
00:34:53.744 --> 00:34:55.943
I know what they'd ask me for...

599
00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:59.184
and that I will have to obey those rules.

600
00:35:00.224 --> 00:35:01.583
That's not what I want.

601
00:35:01.653 --> 00:35:03.124
Why do you hate it so much?

602
00:35:03.724 --> 00:35:05.853
Because I'll have to live as someone who's not me.

603
00:35:06.894 --> 00:35:07.963
You told me that you don't...

604
00:35:07.963 --> 00:35:09.793
want to live as a part of the Haesung family.

605
00:35:10.063 --> 00:35:11.693
That's why you moved out to be independent

606
00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:13.133
I meant I'd be like that...

607
00:35:13.133 --> 00:35:14.534
if I went back without you.

608
00:35:15.304 --> 00:35:16.534
Things have changed now.

609
00:35:17.074 --> 00:35:19.844
Ji An, just take my hand.

610
00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:21.344
Please trust me.

611
00:35:21.344 --> 00:35:23.443
Why do I have to trust you?

612
00:35:24.514 --> 00:35:26.244
Do I have to take your hand...

613
00:35:26.244 --> 00:35:27.983
whenever you reach out?

614
00:35:27.983 --> 00:35:29.483
Why? Because you're rich?

615
00:35:30.483 --> 00:35:32.014
I don't need it.

616
00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:33.784
I don't like it because you're rich.

617
00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:36.653
I...

618
00:35:38.324 --> 00:35:40.124
just started to be happy only now.

619
00:35:41.063 --> 00:35:43.563
I just started to learn what it is like...

620
00:35:44.293 --> 00:35:46.603
to live at ease. Here. Now.

621
00:35:46.664 --> 00:35:48.833
Is your happiness cutting wood at a carpenter's?

622
00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:50.304
How would it make you happy?

623
00:35:51.534 --> 00:35:52.704
What did you say?

624
00:35:52.704 --> 00:35:54.903
You worked desperately to become a regular employee.

625
00:35:55.244 --> 00:35:56.974
I'm telling you that I will end that for you.

626
00:35:59.614 --> 00:36:01.414
Why are you upset with me?

627
00:36:01.713 --> 00:36:03.253
You don't have the right to be upset.

628
00:36:05.483 --> 00:36:07.054
Why would you think the poor...

629
00:36:07.054 --> 00:36:08.954
always have to listen to the rich?

630
00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:14.063
Do I not have the right to reject Haesung?

631
00:36:15.264 --> 00:36:17.394
Is it wrong to not like you because...

632
00:36:18.133 --> 00:36:19.534
you're the successor of Haesung?

633
00:36:22.733 --> 00:36:23.874
I did work hard...

634
00:36:23.874 --> 00:36:26.003
just to be a regular employee...

635
00:36:26.574 --> 00:36:27.844
in the past.

636
00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:29.813
But not anymore.

637
00:36:33.043 --> 00:36:34.213
I...

638
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.383
have been through life and death.

639
00:36:38.313 --> 00:36:40.684
So I know it now. I know it.

640
00:36:42.523 --> 00:36:44.153
Where I belong,

641
00:36:44.353 --> 00:36:46.054
who I am,

642
00:36:46.693 --> 00:36:48.824
and where I can be happy.

643
00:36:52.394 --> 00:36:53.463
You...

644
00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:57.173
You're serious.

645
00:36:58.003 --> 00:36:59.273
Yes.

646
00:37:00.304 --> 00:37:01.403
I am.

647
00:37:04.443 --> 00:37:07.284
So please stop it, and go back.

648
00:37:08.844 --> 00:37:10.253
I keep feeling sorry,

649
00:37:11.153 --> 00:37:12.883
and it's hard to watch you struggle.

650
00:37:19.664 --> 00:37:21.364
I should get back to work.

651
00:38:34.204 --> 00:38:36.503
My name is Seo Tae Soo.

652
00:38:36.934 --> 00:38:38.574
I hope it won't happen,

653
00:38:38.574 --> 00:38:41.043
but if you find me collapsed on the floor,

654
00:38:41.144 --> 00:38:43.144
please call Hyangrim Hospital...

655
00:38:43.273 --> 00:38:46.443
or Ms. Yang Mi Jung.

656
00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:50.983
It's done now.

657
00:38:55.224 --> 00:38:56.423
Have a good day.

658
00:39:01.193 --> 00:39:03.164
(Overseas call)

659
00:39:06.963 --> 00:39:08.003
Hello?

660
00:39:08.034 --> 00:39:10.534
Ji Tae? This is Seok Doo.

661
00:39:10.804 --> 00:39:13.043
Hello, what's the matter?

662
00:39:16.003 --> 00:39:17.943
Dad is being odd?

663
00:39:18.043 --> 00:39:20.014
He has a stomachache and throws up often.

664
00:39:20.313 --> 00:39:23.284
He shows symptoms of stomach cancer.

665
00:39:23.353 --> 00:39:25.353
You should take him to the hospital.

666
00:39:25.383 --> 00:39:26.883
This doesn't feel good.

667
00:39:26.883 --> 00:39:28.684
Okay. I will.

668
00:39:30.494 --> 00:39:32.753
Thank you. Bye.

669
00:39:49.543 --> 00:39:50.644
Tae Soo.

670
00:39:56.883 --> 00:39:59.554
Tae Soo, what's wrong?

671
00:40:00.083 --> 00:40:01.883
You're breaking out in a cold sweat.

672
00:40:02.454 --> 00:40:04.153
What's the matter?

673
00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:06.563
I'm okay.

674
00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:08.364
You're not okay.

675
00:40:08.693 --> 00:40:11.333
I should call 911 and take you to the emergency room.

676
00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:14.304
No, you don't have to do that. My goodness.

677
00:40:14.333 --> 00:40:15.364
Never mind.

678
00:40:21.244 --> 00:40:24.414
Since it's for a family, I'll serve this one.

679
00:40:24.414 --> 00:40:25.414
Okay.

680
00:40:29.914 --> 00:40:31.353
Here's your order.

681
00:40:31.353 --> 00:40:33.724
<v ->It's our new menu. - It looks good.</v>

682
00:40:37.324 --> 00:40:38.693
How do you like it?

683
00:40:38.954 --> 00:40:41.664
The patty's made with beef only.

684
00:40:43.094 --> 00:40:44.864
It's moist and delicious.

685
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:48.063
Honey, your parents would like this too.

686
00:40:48.063 --> 00:40:50.273
<v ->Let's bring them here. - Okay.</v>

687
00:41:09.054 --> 00:41:12.054
I didn't believe my husband when he said...

688
00:41:12.054 --> 00:41:14.624
Tae Soo showed symptoms of stomach cancer.

689
00:41:14.894 --> 00:41:17.463
But I found Tae Soo crouched outside the gate.

690
00:41:18.764 --> 00:41:21.264
I don't think it's something to ignore.

691
00:41:22.864 --> 00:41:24.804
He... He's showing Seok Doo's symptoms?

692
00:41:31.874 --> 00:41:34.043
My mom's full of energy.

693
00:41:35.443 --> 00:41:37.114
She's fine without me.

694
00:41:43.653 --> 00:41:44.853
Oh, I'm sorry.

695
00:41:45.793 --> 00:41:47.193
What? Mom...

696
00:41:55.503 --> 00:41:58.333
Why didn't she recognize me?

697
00:42:08.383 --> 00:42:10.784
He's taking guitar lessons and naps.

698
00:42:11.114 --> 00:42:12.184
It can't be.

699
00:42:18.423 --> 00:42:20.523
Did I sleep for that long?

700
00:42:26.704 --> 00:42:28.333
Ji Ho, you too?

701
00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:30.903
Why are you at home?

702
00:42:31.773 --> 00:42:34.144
Because of you. Sit down.

703
00:42:37.844 --> 00:42:39.144
What for?

704
00:42:39.684 --> 00:42:42.213
Seok Doo called me.

705
00:42:43.014 --> 00:42:44.153
Seok Doo called?

706
00:42:44.653 --> 00:42:45.883
What for?

707
00:42:46.253 --> 00:42:49.793
You've been vomiting and having stomach aches.

708
00:42:49.994 --> 00:42:51.994
He thinks they're stomach cancer symptoms,

709
00:42:51.994 --> 00:42:53.563
and he told us that you should see a doctor.

710
00:42:54.193 --> 00:42:55.864
Gosh, he must have lost his mind.

711
00:42:56.394 --> 00:42:58.733
Grandma died of stomach cancer too.

712
00:42:59.563 --> 00:43:01.003
It runs in the family.

713
00:43:01.463 --> 00:43:02.833
It wasn't just a few times.

714
00:43:02.974 --> 00:43:05.434
Ji Ho saw it and Mom noticed.

715
00:43:05.434 --> 00:43:06.974
And earlier, Hae Ja saw it too.

716
00:43:06.974 --> 00:43:10.173
He told you nonsense just to cause us trouble.

717
00:43:10.874 --> 00:43:13.043
It's not that. I'm fine.

718
00:43:13.514 --> 00:43:15.713
Let's go to the ER with us.

719
00:43:15.883 --> 00:43:18.583
I got a physical so I could board the ship.

720
00:43:18.883 --> 00:43:20.684
I just have stomach ulcers.

721
00:43:21.353 --> 00:43:23.054
You got a check-up?

722
00:43:23.394 --> 00:43:24.653
I did.

723
00:43:26.054 --> 00:43:28.923
Then show me the results.

724
00:43:30.164 --> 00:43:31.193
What?

725
00:43:31.193 --> 00:43:33.204
To see if the test was valid.

726
00:43:33.204 --> 00:43:36.603
Why would I show you what I got and checked?

727
00:43:36.833 --> 00:43:39.974
Then show it to me so I can look at it too.

728
00:43:39.974 --> 00:43:43.144
Why do you want to see my physical test results?

729
00:43:43.144 --> 00:43:44.874
Because we're worried.

730
00:43:45.644 --> 00:43:46.943
Why are you worried?

731
00:43:47.483 --> 00:43:48.914
Why do you care?

732
00:43:49.184 --> 00:43:52.983
I said I'm fine. What right do you have to ask?

733
00:43:53.483 --> 00:43:56.353
How could you say we don't have any rights?

734
00:43:56.353 --> 00:43:58.153
We're family.

735
00:43:58.153 --> 00:43:59.793
Why are we family?

736
00:44:00.164 --> 00:44:03.563
I told you before that we'll fend for ourselves.

737
00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:05.963
Stay out of my business.

738
00:44:08.034 --> 00:44:11.704
I won't ask you to pay for my medical bills, so stop.

739
00:44:11.704 --> 00:44:13.503
Don't say that.

740
00:44:13.644 --> 00:44:15.344
This is not about the hospital bills.

741
00:44:15.474 --> 00:44:16.974
Then what's the fuss?

742
00:44:17.114 --> 00:44:18.313
Dad.

743
00:44:18.713 --> 00:44:20.844
If you get so overly sensitive,

744
00:44:21.684 --> 00:44:23.184
it'll be too hard on us.

745
00:44:23.184 --> 00:44:24.353
Dad.

746
00:44:24.713 --> 00:44:27.753
Are you that angry that I considered emigrating...

747
00:44:27.753 --> 00:44:29.124
and moving out?

748
00:44:30.094 --> 00:44:33.693
I was disappointed and angry with you and Mom.

749
00:44:34.693 --> 00:44:36.023
Yes.

750
00:44:36.764 --> 00:44:40.333
Did it never occur to you to ask why we did that...

751
00:44:40.403 --> 00:44:44.233
and what we were thinking?

752
00:44:47.204 --> 00:44:48.574
If I were richer,

753
00:44:48.574 --> 00:44:51.813
not only would you have mentioned emigration,

754
00:44:52.374 --> 00:44:54.313
but you would've discussed with me.

755
00:44:56.313 --> 00:44:58.853
If I could've afforded your college tuition,

756
00:44:58.853 --> 00:45:01.724
would you not have told me before giving up?

757
00:45:02.483 --> 00:45:05.153
No, you wouldn't have even given up.

758
00:45:08.224 --> 00:45:09.523
Ji Tae.

759
00:45:10.264 --> 00:45:13.733
Do you know how cheerful and considerate you were?

760
00:45:15.034 --> 00:45:16.233
After the bankruptcy,

761
00:45:16.574 --> 00:45:19.574
you clammed up whenever you came home.

762
00:45:19.574 --> 00:45:22.644
You stopped smiling and didn't talk with me.

763
00:45:22.874 --> 00:45:24.213
You never made eye contact either.

764
00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:28.514
That was because I was still in shock.

765
00:45:30.054 --> 00:45:31.554
I know that.

766
00:45:32.983 --> 00:45:34.724
We went from being rich...

767
00:45:34.724 --> 00:45:36.824
to living in a small room in a day.

768
00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:39.793
How could you smile about that?

769
00:45:40.364 --> 00:45:42.764
You became worried about your future, annoyed,

770
00:45:43.063 --> 00:45:45.034
and hated me.

771
00:45:45.434 --> 00:45:46.534
I know.

772
00:45:47.133 --> 00:45:48.704
Then why complain?

773
00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:50.603
Just because I know...

774
00:45:51.534 --> 00:45:53.344
and understand you all...

775
00:45:54.344 --> 00:45:56.313
doesn't mean I didn't feel miserable.

776
00:45:58.773 --> 00:46:00.043
I felt terrible.

777
00:46:00.684 --> 00:46:02.443
I didn't know what to do.

778
00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:04.883
I felt terrible, but I didn't have the energy...

779
00:46:04.883 --> 00:46:06.653
to tell you not to worry.

780
00:46:07.423 --> 00:46:09.224
So I cowed around you.

781
00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:11.494
Ji Tae, Ji An, Ji Soo, Ji Ho,

782
00:46:12.494 --> 00:46:13.693
and you.

783
00:46:15.293 --> 00:46:17.034
I cowed around you.

784
00:46:17.693 --> 00:46:20.164
No one talked, discussed anything,

785
00:46:20.164 --> 00:46:21.833
or chatted with me.

786
00:46:22.764 --> 00:46:24.773
You all just smiled.

787
00:46:25.874 --> 00:46:28.644
I pretended not to care and smiled along.

788
00:46:29.603 --> 00:46:30.813
However,

789
00:46:31.773 --> 00:46:35.514
now, I'm sick of tiptoeing around you all the time.

790
00:46:38.014 --> 00:46:39.284
Now, I know...

791
00:46:39.983 --> 00:46:43.554
that I was a useless and meaningless father.

792
00:46:44.923 --> 00:46:46.664
And an untrustworthy husband.

793
00:46:48.494 --> 00:46:51.764
So I'm going to live my own life now.

794
00:46:52.233 --> 00:46:54.103
I'll make money on the fishing vessel...

795
00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:57.273
and do everything I wanted but couldn't do.

796
00:46:57.934 --> 00:47:00.043
So don't interfere with my life from now on.

797
00:47:00.903 --> 00:47:04.014
You have a way of shutting us up.

798
00:47:05.844 --> 00:47:07.313
Yes, that's it.

799
00:47:07.784 --> 00:47:09.213
That's what I want.

800
00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:11.784
Stay out of my business.

801
00:47:13.583 --> 00:47:15.483
Okay, fine.

802
00:47:26.034 --> 00:47:28.563
Can't he just show us the results?

803
00:47:51.494 --> 00:47:52.963
Will you really...

804
00:47:53.724 --> 00:47:55.494
stay angry until you leave?

805
00:47:56.293 --> 00:47:57.894
Why do I care?

806
00:47:58.563 --> 00:48:02.003
You mean nothing to me now.

807
00:48:04.603 --> 00:48:06.503
When a couple loses trust,

808
00:48:06.744 --> 00:48:08.574
we're as good as strangers.

809
00:48:10.344 --> 00:48:11.474
Honey.

810
00:48:12.414 --> 00:48:14.244
I said I'm sorry.

811
00:48:36.403 --> 00:48:38.534
When your dad refused to give me your number,

812
00:48:38.804 --> 00:48:40.043
I knew something was up.

813
00:48:40.903 --> 00:48:43.414
I want you to think about who you used to be...

814
00:48:43.773 --> 00:48:45.713
and what kind of person you once were.

815
00:48:45.974 --> 00:48:48.443
Just think about that once more.

816
00:48:48.943 --> 00:48:50.313
Only you can shine light...

817
00:48:50.583 --> 00:48:52.883
upon the road you wish to take.

818
00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:55.753
Why did he say that instead of saying...

819
00:48:56.454 --> 00:48:58.324
Ms. No had come over?

820
00:49:01.364 --> 00:49:03.534
(Contact List, Dad)

821
00:49:06.434 --> 00:49:08.633
The phone is turned off.

822
00:49:08.633 --> 00:49:10.974
Please leave a message after...

823
00:49:17.844 --> 00:49:21.383
Well, dad turned his phone off.

824
00:49:21.983 --> 00:49:23.983
Is he working now?

825
00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:26.583
I was wondering...

826
00:49:27.583 --> 00:49:29.583
if I should call you or not.

827
00:49:30.554 --> 00:49:31.894
Is something wrong?

828
00:49:38.633 --> 00:49:41.264
Close your mouth. You look like an idiot.

829
00:49:44.204 --> 00:49:45.704
It all makes sense now.

830
00:49:46.903 --> 00:49:48.974
Why you were fixated on Ji An.

831
00:49:50.043 --> 00:49:51.273
I found it odd.

832
00:49:52.644 --> 00:49:55.083
You met a few times by that car accident...

833
00:49:55.383 --> 00:49:56.954
and met again at work.

834
00:49:58.083 --> 00:50:01.454
I didn't think that was enough to fall in love.

835
00:50:03.753 --> 00:50:05.853
But there was much more to it.

836
00:50:06.894 --> 00:50:09.293
No wonder it was so messed up.

837
00:50:09.594 --> 00:50:11.534
It'll barely work even if we worked together...

838
00:50:11.864 --> 00:50:13.563
but Ji An won't cooperate.

839
00:50:13.864 --> 00:50:15.664
Her head's screwed on right.

840
00:50:15.934 --> 00:50:17.273
You're the crazy one.

841
00:50:18.103 --> 00:50:21.874
There's no way your family will accept her.

842
00:50:23.574 --> 00:50:26.313
She belongs to the creeps who stole their daughter.

843
00:50:26.313 --> 00:50:27.443
"Creeps"?

844
00:50:27.983 --> 00:50:29.514
Watch your language.

845
00:50:32.213 --> 00:50:33.423
This won't work out...

846
00:50:34.583 --> 00:50:37.824
unless you scratch your name off the family tree.

847
00:50:37.994 --> 00:50:40.764
But you won't do that, would you?

848
00:50:41.063 --> 00:50:42.764
I left without a penny.

849
00:50:42.764 --> 00:50:43.864
No.

850
00:50:44.133 --> 00:50:46.603
If you really turned your back on Haesung,

851
00:50:47.133 --> 00:50:48.704
why won't you spend your money?

852
00:50:49.534 --> 00:50:51.474
You got it when you started preschool.

853
00:50:51.474 --> 00:50:52.833
It's already yours.

854
00:50:53.003 --> 00:50:54.403
You won't spend it...

855
00:50:55.103 --> 00:50:57.273
because you're going to go back.

856
00:50:57.344 --> 00:50:59.344
You're sticking to the Haesung rules.

857
00:50:59.344 --> 00:51:01.483
Because I left to win over Ji An.

858
00:51:02.083 --> 00:51:03.353
Being independent...

859
00:51:03.353 --> 00:51:05.813
will free me from my grandpa and parents.

860
00:51:06.753 --> 00:51:08.253
Haesung can absorb...

861
00:51:08.253 --> 00:51:09.954
the company I started.

862
00:51:11.523 --> 00:51:13.063
It won't work like that.

863
00:51:13.364 --> 00:51:14.563
I can do it.

864
00:51:14.563 --> 00:51:15.894
The investment will come in today.

865
00:51:17.364 --> 00:51:19.133
Ji An's refusal is a bigger the problem.

866
00:51:19.364 --> 00:51:21.833
She refused? What did she refuse?

867
00:51:22.063 --> 00:51:24.173
She doesn't want to be part of Haesung.

868
00:51:25.003 --> 00:51:26.874
And she hates me because I'm from that family.

869
00:51:26.874 --> 00:51:27.903
What?

870
00:51:29.974 --> 00:51:32.574
She won't even look at what she can't have.

871
00:51:32.713 --> 00:51:33.813
No.

872
00:51:34.983 --> 00:51:37.713
She found what makes her happy in her situation.

873
00:51:37.753 --> 00:51:38.983
You believe that?

874
00:51:39.983 --> 00:51:41.583
What woman...

875
00:51:41.583 --> 00:51:44.094
would refuse to marry the heir of Haesung?

876
00:51:46.193 --> 00:51:47.923
She sounded serious.

877
00:51:48.624 --> 00:51:50.733
First, gain independence.

878
00:51:51.594 --> 00:51:53.804
Show her that you're able to stand...

879
00:51:53.804 --> 00:51:55.833
away from Mr. No and your mom.

880
00:51:56.164 --> 00:51:57.173
Then ask again...

881
00:51:57.503 --> 00:51:59.003
and see what she says.

882
00:52:00.173 --> 00:52:01.344
Would that work?

883
00:52:02.744 --> 00:52:04.014
Really?

884
00:52:04.014 --> 00:52:05.114
I'm sure about that.

885
00:52:05.414 --> 00:52:07.443
She doesn't trust you right now.

886
00:52:08.644 --> 00:52:09.713
What if...

887
00:52:10.454 --> 00:52:12.083
she's serious?

888
00:52:13.583 --> 00:52:15.653
What if she dislikes my heritage?

889
00:52:15.983 --> 00:52:17.353
Then it's over.

890
00:52:18.293 --> 00:52:19.693
There's no room to negotiate.

891
00:52:27.063 --> 00:52:29.304
You said things were favorable.

892
00:52:30.204 --> 00:52:31.633
What changed?

893
00:52:32.374 --> 00:52:33.804
We had a meeting and...

894
00:52:33.804 --> 00:52:36.204
the directors don't see the merit of investing.

895
00:52:36.374 --> 00:52:37.673
Goodbye then.

896
00:52:51.594 --> 00:52:52.923
(Paju factory)

897
00:52:54.824 --> 00:52:55.864
Hello.

898
00:52:55.864 --> 00:52:57.963
I don't think we can help you.

899
00:52:57.963 --> 00:53:00.733
But you said you're short of work...

900
00:53:01.003 --> 00:53:02.633
so the OEM would be possible.

901
00:53:05.474 --> 00:53:07.443
Your CEO said no?

902
00:53:23.894 --> 00:53:25.153
Yes, Choi Do Kyung speaking.

903
00:53:25.153 --> 00:53:28.164
I'm sorry. We dismissed your proposal.

904
00:53:28.193 --> 00:53:31.534
What? The audit process is over already?

905
00:53:48.114 --> 00:53:49.414
Grandpa?

906
00:53:54.653 --> 00:53:56.353
(Haesung Corporation)

907
00:53:56.954 --> 00:53:57.994
Yes.

908
00:54:00.164 --> 00:54:01.824
It's done already?

909
00:54:03.364 --> 00:54:04.434
Thanks.

910
00:54:10.403 --> 00:54:11.903
Do Kyung will return soon.

911
00:54:12.503 --> 00:54:15.003
He will? How?

912
00:54:15.503 --> 00:54:17.114
I broke his legs.

913
00:54:18.773 --> 00:54:21.344
He doesn't know he can't get away from me.

914
00:54:22.244 --> 00:54:24.713
He was raised to think he's special.

915
00:54:25.414 --> 00:54:27.224
He forgot he owes us.

916
00:54:35.164 --> 00:54:36.494
I lost my passbook.

917
00:54:36.494 --> 00:54:37.633
I need a new one.

918
00:54:37.633 --> 00:54:39.133
Okay. Just a moment.

919
00:54:39.864 --> 00:54:42.264
Fill in this form first.

920
00:54:50.914 --> 00:54:52.074
Are you going home?

921
00:54:52.474 --> 00:54:54.443
I'm going to see a client. I'll drop you off.

922
00:54:54.443 --> 00:54:56.454
Thanks. It's really cold.

923
00:55:22.204 --> 00:55:24.574
He's getting on fine with Ji An,

924
00:55:25.914 --> 00:55:28.614
but he complained that I dumped him?

925
00:55:31.184 --> 00:55:32.653
Was he toying with me?

926
00:55:42.764 --> 00:55:44.494
(Contact List, Ji Ho)

927
00:55:48.133 --> 00:55:50.804
Ji Ho, when's your day off?

928
00:56:19.963 --> 00:56:21.264
Dad.

929
00:56:25.534 --> 00:56:27.103
I'm home.

930
00:56:28.874 --> 00:56:29.874
What for?

931
00:56:29.874 --> 00:56:31.744
Don't even sit if you came here to nag me.

932
00:56:34.644 --> 00:56:36.784
Why is it nagging...

933
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:38.583
if it's about your health?

934
00:56:39.353 --> 00:56:41.423
You don't need to get involved.

935
00:56:41.423 --> 00:56:43.324
I can manage my own health.

936
00:56:44.394 --> 00:56:46.293
Let me take you to a doctor tomorrow.

937
00:56:47.224 --> 00:56:48.293
What?

938
00:56:48.664 --> 00:56:50.133
The checkup you got...

939
00:56:50.133 --> 00:56:51.894
was from a small clinic.

940
00:56:51.894 --> 00:56:53.563
That's why you won't show the results.

941
00:56:54.864 --> 00:56:56.804
And you can't go deep-sea fishing.

942
00:56:57.233 --> 00:56:59.103
That's such hard work.

943
00:56:59.304 --> 00:57:00.943
I made up my mind.

944
00:57:00.943 --> 00:57:02.304
Don't bother me, and go.

945
00:57:04.443 --> 00:57:05.574
Dad.

946
00:57:06.784 --> 00:57:09.443
I'm really sorry.

947
00:57:09.713 --> 00:57:11.514
Stop being angry with me.

948
00:57:16.624 --> 00:57:18.554
Let's not talk about it anymore.

949
00:57:19.423 --> 00:57:21.824
You need to think about my circumstances too.

950
00:57:28.003 --> 00:57:29.133
Your "circumstances"?

951
00:57:29.903 --> 00:57:32.374
How we duped you into living with that family?

952
00:57:34.773 --> 00:57:35.943
I wasn't...

953
00:57:37.173 --> 00:57:40.514
able to face you after that.

954
00:57:42.244 --> 00:57:43.313
Is that so?

955
00:57:44.483 --> 00:57:46.824
It was in my situation.

956
00:57:47.784 --> 00:57:50.054
Why should I consider your situation?

957
00:57:50.724 --> 00:57:53.624
Did you ever tell me how you felt?

958
00:57:54.423 --> 00:57:55.693
After what you did,

959
00:57:55.693 --> 00:57:57.434
don't you dare pretend you care now.

960
00:57:58.764 --> 00:58:02.003
Did you think about it from my perspective?

961
00:58:03.434 --> 00:58:05.103
I did so many times.

962
00:58:05.673 --> 00:58:07.673
I felt terribly bad...

963
00:58:08.074 --> 00:58:10.144
for how I treated you when I left.

964
00:58:10.974 --> 00:58:13.344
Yes. You left.

965
00:58:14.014 --> 00:58:15.443
You left.

966
00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:20.124
I thought you'd say you wouldn't go.

967
00:58:20.724 --> 00:58:23.324
Even if you really were their daughter,

968
00:58:23.594 --> 00:58:25.994
I didn't think you'd say you'd go right away.

969
00:58:26.463 --> 00:58:28.793
You were my daughter for 28 years.

970
00:58:29.193 --> 00:58:32.364
It didn't take you a month or two, or even a week.

971
00:58:32.693 --> 00:58:36.304
Three days. That's all it took for you to say yes.

972
00:58:37.773 --> 00:58:40.874
You left while blaming me for being poor.

973
00:58:43.414 --> 00:58:45.644
I first met you to talk you out of it.

974
00:58:45.874 --> 00:58:48.313
To say that it's not you, and that you shouldn't go.

975
00:58:49.583 --> 00:58:51.114
You already made up your mind,

976
00:58:51.114 --> 00:58:53.023
but I didn't want to hurt you,

977
00:58:53.253 --> 00:58:54.624
so I kept asking...

978
00:58:55.653 --> 00:58:57.793
if you were leaving because of...

979
00:58:57.793 --> 00:58:59.594
what your mom had done.

980
00:59:00.563 --> 00:59:01.624
I thought...

981
00:59:02.264 --> 00:59:03.934
you have made up your mind...

982
00:59:03.934 --> 00:59:05.733
in a hurry for our sake.

983
00:59:07.063 --> 00:59:08.434
Ji An.

984
00:59:09.903 --> 00:59:10.974
You can't...

985
00:59:12.173 --> 00:59:13.543
go there.

986
00:59:14.503 --> 00:59:15.543
I'm sorry...

987
00:59:16.514 --> 00:59:17.773
for all...

988
00:59:18.043 --> 00:59:20.144
the tough times you went through.

989
00:59:20.614 --> 00:59:22.483
It's about what you want.

990
00:59:22.943 --> 00:59:24.554
That's what counts.

991
00:59:25.583 --> 00:59:27.624
I... I want to know what you're thinking.

992
00:59:27.624 --> 00:59:30.653
If they say you don't have to move in,

993
00:59:31.353 --> 00:59:32.753
will you stay here?

994
00:59:33.824 --> 00:59:36.224
I wanted to hear you say you had no choice.

995
00:59:37.063 --> 00:59:39.333
Only then, would you be less perplexed...

996
00:59:39.664 --> 00:59:41.563
even if I told you the truth,

997
00:59:42.103 --> 00:59:43.103
Yes.

998
00:59:44.173 --> 00:59:45.434
I want to go.

999
00:59:46.574 --> 00:59:48.644
I struggled so much until now.

1000
00:59:48.744 --> 00:59:50.014
I wanted to die every day.

1001
00:59:50.014 --> 00:59:51.874
My efforts alone wouldn't cut it.

1002
00:59:51.874 --> 00:59:54.813
Why did you pick me up in the first place?

1003
00:59:55.844 --> 00:59:57.684
I never thought...

1004
00:59:57.914 --> 00:59:59.923
that I'd hear my own daughter say...

1005
00:59:59.923 --> 01:00:01.724
she wanted to die.

1006
01:00:03.423 --> 01:00:05.554
I looked into your eyes,

1007
01:00:06.253 --> 01:00:07.923
and I couldn't speak.

1008
01:00:08.793 --> 01:00:11.193
You asked me why I'd adopted you.

1009
01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.304
I needed to say...

1010
01:00:13.304 --> 01:00:15.304
it was Ji Soo and not you.

1011
01:00:16.434 --> 01:00:17.974
But my mouth froze...

1012
01:00:18.434 --> 01:00:20.273
and my heart stopped.

1013
01:00:21.144 --> 01:00:22.804
I couldn't move...

1014
01:00:24.014 --> 01:00:25.673
as if I was having a nightmare.

1015
01:00:27.983 --> 01:00:29.383
I'm sorry.

1016
01:00:30.554 --> 01:00:31.614
No.

1017
01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:34.523
It's possible for you to do that.

1018
01:00:35.253 --> 01:00:37.594
You must've struggled so much.

1019
01:00:38.153 --> 01:00:40.624
So I'm sorry...

1020
01:00:40.994 --> 01:00:42.324
and sorry again.

1021
01:00:43.094 --> 01:00:44.164
But...

1022
01:00:44.963 --> 01:00:47.164
it's not fine for me.

1023
01:00:47.903 --> 01:00:51.133
I was rejected by my own daughter.

1024
01:00:51.574 --> 01:00:54.804
Even when you realized it was Ji Soo,

1025
01:00:54.804 --> 01:00:56.173
you didn't come look for me.

1026
01:00:57.114 --> 01:00:59.514
"Dad, I'm in trouble."

1027
01:01:00.184 --> 01:01:03.353
That's what you and Ji Tae always said...

1028
01:01:05.114 --> 01:01:07.054
when I was still competent.

1029
01:01:08.883 --> 01:01:10.293
Dad.

1030
01:01:12.153 --> 01:01:15.693
You made me realize that I'm a useless dad,

1031
01:01:15.864 --> 01:01:17.364
and I've realized it.

1032
01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:18.934
So...

1033
01:01:19.764 --> 01:01:21.633
leave me alone now.

1034
01:01:22.733 --> 01:01:24.034
I'm sorry.

1035
01:01:24.074 --> 01:01:25.974
Don't say that anymore.

1036
01:01:27.574 --> 01:01:28.874
I don't need it.

1037
01:01:29.304 --> 01:01:30.914
I don't want it anymore.

1038
01:01:31.543 --> 01:01:32.673
You guys.

1039
01:02:32.474 --> 01:02:33.673
I'm sick...

1040
01:02:34.903 --> 01:02:36.414
of living like this.

1041
01:02:37.543 --> 01:02:40.083
People ignore me and despise me.

1042
01:02:40.514 --> 01:02:43.353
Living a miserable and servile life.

1043
01:02:44.253 --> 01:02:45.983
I can't take it anymore. No.

1044
01:02:47.454 --> 01:02:49.124
Why do you not want me to go?

1045
01:02:49.324 --> 01:02:52.293
Why did you pick me up in the first place?

1046
01:03:39.003 --> 01:03:41.943
Why are you waiting here? Someone might follow you.

1047
01:03:44.744 --> 01:03:46.014
Are you that scared?

1048
01:04:00.693 --> 01:04:03.594
I am. I'm very terrified.

1049
01:04:05.063 --> 01:04:06.563
So what are you going to do for me?

1050
01:04:12.233 --> 01:04:13.503
I'll ask you only one question.

1051
01:04:14.673 --> 01:04:15.943
Please answer it.

1052
01:04:18.673 --> 01:04:20.014
Do you...

1053
01:04:21.043 --> 01:04:22.313
really mean that?

1054
01:04:24.153 --> 01:04:26.284
If you really meant it when you said...

1055
01:04:28.153 --> 01:04:29.454
that I must not be the son of Haesung Corporation,

1056
01:04:30.253 --> 01:04:31.293
I'll...

1057
01:04:32.653 --> 01:04:34.224
stop now.

1058
01:04:38.994 --> 01:04:40.333
Answer me.

1059
01:04:44.204 --> 01:04:45.434
I really meant it.

1060
01:04:45.574 --> 01:04:46.704
Then...

1061
01:04:47.744 --> 01:04:48.744
let's stop this.

1062
01:04:50.443 --> 01:04:51.744
If you really meant it,

1063
01:04:54.114 --> 01:04:55.784
I can't help it.

1064
01:04:57.684 --> 01:04:59.083
Even if I die,

1065
01:05:00.753 --> 01:05:02.994
I'll still be the son of Haesung Corporation.

1066
01:05:10.563 --> 01:05:11.764
However,

1067
01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:14.103
you must remember this.

1068
01:05:15.664 --> 01:05:16.773
When I say...

1069
01:05:18.204 --> 01:05:19.903
I won't do something, I really mean it.

1070
01:05:22.074 --> 01:05:23.313
Like you said,

1071
01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:27.344
I can't stop being myself for you.

1072
01:05:30.554 --> 01:05:31.684
Okay.

1073
01:05:35.224 --> 01:05:36.954
I'll give you one last chance.

1074
01:05:38.994 --> 01:05:40.124
Don't let me go.

1075
01:05:57.713 --> 01:05:58.943
Then it's over.

1076
01:06:00.014 --> 01:06:01.244
Goodbye.

1077
01:06:47.164 --> 01:06:49.633
(My Golden Life)

1078
01:06:51.994 --> 01:06:53.733
Why are you so hard to get?

1079
01:06:54.403 --> 01:06:56.264
Act like you're my boyfriend.

1080
01:06:56.264 --> 01:06:58.233
Hi. He's my boyfriend.

1081
01:07:00.074 --> 01:07:01.173
We need to talk.

1082
01:07:01.403 --> 01:07:03.043
Do Kyung will be home soon.

1083
01:07:03.043 --> 01:07:05.374
Father blocked all of Do Kyung's investments.

1084
01:07:05.374 --> 01:07:07.784
I don't want to live as a horse on Grandpa's chess.

1085
01:07:07.883 --> 01:07:09.483
How did it go with Ji An?

1086
01:07:09.483 --> 01:07:10.753
I'll try to hate her.

1087
01:07:10.914 --> 01:07:13.353
My goodness. You did a good job.

1088
01:07:13.653 --> 01:07:14.753
Goodbye.

1089
01:07:15.423 --> 01:07:16.923
Are you Seo Tae Soo's daughter?

1090
01:07:16.923 --> 01:07:19.764
He collapsed and is going to the emergency room.

1091
01:07:19.764 --> 01:07:21.193
My father?
