What brings you here, Doctor?

3
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.848
I came for an interview.

4
00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:32.525
Please show me your I.D.

00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:55.174
Isn't Myungin University
the top medical university in Korea?

9
00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:56.771
It is.

10
00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:04.918
He was top of his class, and passed
the board exam with a perfect score.

11
00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:09.205
- This is impressive.
- Thank you.

12
00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:11.488
What about his psychological test scores?

13
00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.240
- His scores are good.
- They're not just good.

14
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.294
With qualifications at this level,
he has a brilliant mind, just brilliant.

15
00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:21.734
It looks like you worked
at Myungin University Hospital until now.

16
00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:23.654
It's your fourth year
of residency as a surgeon.

17
00:02:23.654 --> 00:02:25.057
That's right.

18
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:29.337
If you had endured a few more months,
you would've become a specialist.

19
00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:31.627
So why did you quit?

20
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.188
- It didn't suit my character.
- What? Being a doctor?

21
00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:39.009
Or... your specialty?

22
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:41.958
My specialty didn't suit my character.

23
00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.175
You could've just switched
specialties instead of quitting then.

24
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:49.009
The apprentice system
and hospital atmosphere didn't suit me.

25
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.288
It isn't because you caused an accident?

26
00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.267
An accident?

27
00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:59.896
Why else would a fourth-year
resident doctor quit a major hospital?

28
00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.969
A medical accident. Or...

29
00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:04.952
an issue involving a woman.

30
00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:12.902
- That's not it.
- I can find out with one call.

31
00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:15.732
I can find out why you quit the hospital.

32
00:03:15.732 --> 00:03:20.085
If you doubt me, then go ahead
and ask the chief professor.

33
00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:31.870
Don't feel insulted.
Prisons are a special place

34
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.749
so he wants to be meticulous.

35
00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:36.586
It's okay.

36
00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:41.574
Then let me ask you this.

37
00:03:41.574 --> 00:03:46.392
Is a relative of yours
imprisoned here, by any chance?

38
00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:49.063
- No, Sir.
- Then...

39
00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:51.645
do you hold a grudge
against someone here?

40
00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.170
No, Sir.

41
00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:09.353
- What the hell?
- What?

42
00:04:23.453 --> 00:04:25.757
- What the hell is this?
- What the hell?

43
00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:30.694
What the hell is he doing?

44
00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:38.574
Gae Sang.

45
00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:41.920
Hey, Yoon Gae Sang!

46
00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.297
People would find it unbearable.

47
00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:58.602
I bet you didn't know
when you stabbed me and left...

48
00:04:58.602 --> 00:05:00.672
that we'd meet here.

49
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.531
Ho... how are you here...

50
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:09.442
I've always been here,
waiting for you to show up.

51
00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.901
Hyung Bum, ca... calm down, okay?

52
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:16.317
I really needed money at the time.

53
00:05:17.704 --> 00:05:20.966
Let... let me explain what happened...

54
00:05:26.245 --> 00:05:30.715
I'll give you all the money.

55
00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:33.475
I had no choice at the time!

56
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:40.603
Please, put that down,
you son of a bitch!

57
00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:50.348
Guard! Guard...

58
00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:58.694
<i>Unless you have an ulterior motive</i>

59
00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:01.257
there's no reason for you
to apply to a prison.

60
00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:06.583
With qualifications like these, and just
two months till you become a specialist.

61
00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:11.031
Then, Doctor, are you here
because you lack qualifications?

62
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:13.946
- Excuse me?
- If it's as you just said...

63
00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:16.533
you must have
another reason for being here.

64
00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:18.848
Unless you're lacking
in qualifications, that is.

65
00:06:24.482 --> 00:06:28.006
I simply want
to take care of the patients--

66
00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:32.723
I applied for this position
for the same exact reason.

67
00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:36.845
It's because of my little sister...

68
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:40.078
who passed away because she
couldn't get treated in time.

69
00:06:55.276 --> 00:06:58.978
- I'll be back.
- Make lots of money, okay?

70
00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:13.377
<i>My sister, who had biliary atresia...</i>
(Blocked bile ducts in the liver.)

71
00:07:13.377 --> 00:07:17.442
<i>constantly had high fevers
and went into comas...</i>

72
00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:19.780
<i>So when my father wasn't around</i>

73
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.322
<i>I had to run to the hospital
with my sister on my back.</i>

74
00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.137
Is anyone there? Please save my sister!

75
00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:30.828
<i>It wasn't easy finding a hospital
that was open at night...</i>

76
00:07:30.828 --> 00:07:32.533
- What's wrong with you?
- Just this once.

77
00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:34.381
- Go!
- Please!

78
00:07:34.381 --> 00:07:37.620
- Do you have a conscience?
- Just this once.

79
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.447
Just this once!

80
00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:42.002
<i>And even when I found an open hospital...</i>

81
00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:45.778
<i>we were kicked out
because we had no money.</i>

82
00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:47.578
Please...

83
00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:51.584
save my sister.

84
00:07:51.584 --> 00:07:53.129
Please.

85
00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:55.817
Anyone can go to a university hospital

86
00:07:55.817 --> 00:07:58.807
and if they have money,
they can get treated.

87
00:07:58.807 --> 00:08:00.864
But I wanted to help the neglected

88
00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:04.482
who don't have the power
or money to go to such hospitals.

89
00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:08.102
The kind of people...

90
00:08:08.102 --> 00:08:10.949
who can't go to the hospital,
even when they want to.

91
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.888
Do you have anything left to say?

92
00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:22.855
No.

93
00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:26.432
Then, please wait outside for a moment.

94
00:08:40.889 --> 00:08:43.868
I'm against hiring Kang In Kyu.

95
00:08:43.868 --> 00:08:45.427
Wait, what's the problem this time?

96
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:48.835
It's a waste of resources
to hire a surgeon for a prison.

97
00:08:48.835 --> 00:08:52.119
You keep saying "prison."

98
00:08:52.119 --> 00:08:55.465
But we took exams to get here, you know.
We're national public servants!

99
00:08:55.465 --> 00:09:00.249
This prison is worthy of having
such a talented individual!

100
00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:04.994
One doctor of internal medicine,
and one surgeon. It's perfect.

101
00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:07.823
- I approve.
- I approve too.

102
00:09:07.823 --> 00:09:11.075
I'm the only one with the right
to hire for the medical department.

103
00:09:17.248 --> 00:09:19.643
He said... he wanted nothing else...

104
00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:22.061
but for you to die...

105
00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:27.104
He told me to kill you.

106
00:09:27.104 --> 00:09:31.900
Did you sleep soundly after listening
to that bastard and betraying me?

107
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.152
What else was I supposed to do then?

108
00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:40.254
If I hadn't done that,
he would've killed me.

109
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.091
- Hey, stop!
- Hey, what are you doing?

110
00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:02.142
Medic!

111
00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:15.307
It's an emergency!

112
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.066
He has an abdominal stab wound.

113
00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:32.464
<i>It's an aortic rupture.</i>

114
00:10:33.637 --> 00:10:35.965
What are you doing? Do something.

115
00:10:37.628 --> 00:10:40.479
- Doctor!
- Wait

116
00:10:40.479 --> 00:10:42.369
where's the emergency detention center?

117
00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:46.164
They carried Prisoner
Park Sang Pyo out this morning.

118
00:10:46.164 --> 00:10:50.013
- Then, call 911--
- We already did.

119
00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:54.759
Wait, this...

120
00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.474
You can't!

121
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.104
He'll die as soon as you pull it out.

122
00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:04.653
How long does it take
to get to the nearest major hospital?

123
00:11:04.653 --> 00:11:07.754
- About an hour.
- He won't last long this way.

124
00:11:07.754 --> 00:11:10.147
What do we do then?

125
00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:14.051
- We need to operate.
- Op... operate?

126
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.650
What are you doing, Doctor Park?

127
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.897
I... I can't do it.

128
00:11:26.897 --> 00:11:28.860
I'm an internal medicine specialist.

129
00:11:29.493 --> 00:11:33.326
You're a surgeon.
You're a surgeon, right? Do something.

130
00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:36.917
If this prisoner dies, we'll all die.

131
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.955
Do you have a patient monitor?

132
00:11:40.955 --> 00:11:43.573
Yes, we do, but--

133
00:11:43.573 --> 00:11:45.196
What about an anesthetic machine?

134
00:11:47.643 --> 00:11:49.558
- We have one.
- I need to perform a laparotomy

135
00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.456
so please bring me
all the necessary equipment.

136
00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:53.951
- A laparotomy?
- A... a laparotomy?

137
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:55.869
You're going to cut his chest open here?

138
00:11:56.369 --> 00:11:59.591
Who do you think you are?
Do you want to kill him?

139
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:03.888
It's an aortic rupture, if we don't
operate right away, he'll die.

140
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.148
I'm the person in charge here.
If something happens to him

141
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.369
- will you take the responsibility?
- Then should we leave him to die

142
00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:16.873
when we can save him?

143
00:12:16.873 --> 00:12:19.816
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

144
00:12:19.816 --> 00:12:22.294
I haven't decided if I'll hire him yet!

145
00:12:22.294 --> 00:12:25.710
Only our registered
medical personnel can treat patients

146
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.821
- during a medical emergency.
- So...

147
00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:31.621
am I hired or not?

148
00:12:32.121 --> 00:12:33.624
Decide already!

149
00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:44.905
I'm warning you now,
if something goes wrong...

150
00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:49.210
I won't be held responsible.

151
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.092
In one go. One, two, three.

152
00:13:27.081 --> 00:13:29.177
I'll begin.

153
00:13:29.177 --> 00:13:30.661
Okay.

154
00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:35.063
Scalpel.

155
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.643
Bovie.
(Electrosurgical dissection tool.)

156
00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:06.663
- You must take it out in one go.
- Okay.

157
00:14:06.663 --> 00:14:10.153
One, two, three.

158
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:26.354
Self-Retaining Retractor.

159
00:14:45.537 --> 00:14:46.836
Gauze.

160
00:14:55.503 --> 00:14:57.171
Vascular clamp.

161
00:15:05.522 --> 00:15:06.720
Deaver.
(Type of retractor.)

162
00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:14.253
Forceps.

163
00:15:15.772 --> 00:15:17.176
Suture.

164
00:15:33.912 --> 00:15:35.989
Please leave the scissors beside me.

165
00:15:48.183 --> 00:15:50.256
His BP is unstable.

166
00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:54.296
- Tell me the numbers.
- 75/50.

167
00:15:54.296 --> 00:15:56.621
It's continuing to drop.

168
00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:00.022
Hook him up to the Hartmann solution

169
00:16:00.022 --> 00:16:01.669
and assist me with it.
(Solution, helps those with blood loss.)

170
00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.489
Yes, I'll do that.

171
00:16:16.263 --> 00:16:18.417
- Is the blood ready?
- Yes.

172
00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:20.729
Give me all the Type A blood you have.

173
00:16:30.224 --> 00:16:33.179
BP is 70/40. 60/30.

174
00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:34.979
He might go into cardiac arrest.

175
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.056
Prepare the defibrillator.

176
00:17:08.992 --> 00:17:12.333
Get out of the way. You can't touch
the defibrillator with those hands.

177
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.918
200 Joules.

178
00:17:26.342 --> 00:17:27.943
200 Joules.

179
00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:30.295
- Charged.
- Clear.

180
00:17:30.295 --> 00:17:31.582
Shoot.

181
00:17:45.738 --> 00:17:48.314
What are you doing?
Give him the blood transfusion.

182
00:17:51.582 --> 00:17:53.113
300 Joules.

183
00:17:54.015 --> 00:17:55.625
300 Joules.

184
00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:58.130
- Charged.
- Clear.

185
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.492
Shoot.

186
00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:19.043
What do we do?

187
00:18:19.043 --> 00:18:22.485
The BP won't go up,
even with the transfusion.

188
00:18:23.629 --> 00:18:26.444
- Pardon?
- What is it this time?

189
00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:30.188
Did he have any other wounds?

190
00:18:30.188 --> 00:18:31.623
No.

191
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.037
No, not that I know of.

192
00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:43.828
I didn't see any.

193
00:19:04.204 --> 00:19:06.116
Guard!

194
00:19:29.346 --> 00:19:32.096
Let's leave the rest to a major hospital.

195
00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:34.979
The bleeding is so severe,
he could go into cardiac arrest again.

196
00:19:35.486 --> 00:19:39.717
The ambulance will be here soon.
Let's leave the rest to them.

197
00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:51.889
He'll die at this rate!

198
00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:08.683
What's that?

199
00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:23.630
I'll continue with the anastomosis.
(Surgical connection of blood vessels.)

200
00:20:35.613 --> 00:20:39.084
You worked hard today.
You did a really good job.

201
00:20:39.084 --> 00:20:41.488
Oh, thank you.

202
00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:47.174
Good job.

203
00:20:47.174 --> 00:20:49.812
But if anything goes wrong

204
00:20:49.812 --> 00:20:51.891
you'll be held responsible.

205
00:20:53.805 --> 00:20:57.681
Excuse me, we have to go back
inside. There's another patient.

206
00:21:15.603 --> 00:21:19.323
Honey! Honey! Honey...

207
00:21:25.135 --> 00:21:27.079
Honey! Honey!

208
00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.709
Over there. Hurry.

209
00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:31.402
Honey! Oh no!

210
00:21:31.402 --> 00:21:33.725
- What happened?
- He vomited in the car

211
00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:35.507
and suddenly lost consciousness.

212
00:21:35.507 --> 00:21:37.758
What about center chief?
Where's the center chief?

213
00:21:37.758 --> 00:21:40.688
We're looking for him,
but we can't reach him at the moment.

214
00:21:40.688 --> 00:21:44.290
Why don't you leave him
with Doctor Lee for now?

215
00:21:46.008 --> 00:21:49.548
Doctor Lee is also
a top doctor at our hospital.

216
00:21:57.902 --> 00:22:00.479
What do we do?
Hurry and call the center chief!

217
00:22:00.479 --> 00:22:03.699
- Honey, what do we do?
- Let's move him to the ER.

218
00:22:03.699 --> 00:22:08.372
Honey! Honey! Honey!

219
00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:11.735
Please wear this just for today.

220
00:22:11.735 --> 00:22:15.314
When the new gown arrives tomorrow,
I'll embroider your name on it.

221
00:22:15.314 --> 00:22:16.858
Okay.

222
00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:22.747
Come in.

223
00:22:39.126 --> 00:22:42.116
This is Prisoner 4713, a stab patient.

224
00:22:49.043 --> 00:22:50.637
Have a seat.

225
00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:01.747
What happened?

226
00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:05.045
He was the one that stabbed
the patient with the abdomen wound.

227
00:23:05.045 --> 00:23:07.353
He held the piece of glass
with his bare hands.

228
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:10.851
Let me see your wound.

229
00:23:16.658 --> 00:23:18.776
Don't you want to be treated?

230
00:23:21.122 --> 00:23:23.441
That's the last doctor's name.

231
00:23:25.649 --> 00:23:27.533
What's yours?

232
00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:36.193
This is Doctor Kang In Kyu,
he's from a university hospital.

233
00:23:36.816 --> 00:23:38.520
Put your hand on the table.

234
00:23:43.106 --> 00:23:46.886
You're probably more skilled
than the last one then.

235
00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:03.572
Do you have sensation in your fingers?

236
00:24:05.582 --> 00:24:10.204
I can see his tendons. Don't you
think he should go to a hospital?

237
00:24:10.204 --> 00:24:14.004
- Do you have Nylon 70?
- Yes, we do.

238
00:24:14.004 --> 00:24:15.704
That will do then.

239
00:24:15.706 --> 00:24:18.156
Please give me three packs
of Nylon 70 and lidocaine.

240
00:24:21.348 --> 00:24:23.985
Okay, I'll do that.

241
00:24:40.584 --> 00:24:43.969
Have we met somewhere before?

242
00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:52.389
You've met me before, haven't you?

243
00:24:58.037 --> 00:25:00.550
- Yes.
- Where?

244
00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:06.726
On the news, a long time ago.

245
00:25:12.632 --> 00:25:16.882
I'm not surprised.
I was pretty famous back then.

246
00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:29.674
Okay, be careful. Be careful, okay?

247
00:25:34.613 --> 00:25:39.456
This is urgent! Emergency! Emergency!
Emergency patient! Emergency patient!

248
00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:42.625
Wait! We're full right now,
we don't have any room.

249
00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:43.625
What did you say?

250
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:46.309
How could you blindly accept
a patient when we're full?

251
00:25:46.309 --> 00:25:49.096
- I told them we couldn't--
- Did you report the deceased?

252
00:25:49.096 --> 00:25:51.700
- Not yet.
- What are you doing then?

253
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.177
Should we turn away a dying patient then?

254
00:25:55.469 --> 00:25:57.669
- Please wrap it up.
- Okay.

255
00:25:59.162 --> 00:26:01.285
Let me see. What happened?

256
00:26:01.285 --> 00:26:04.927
He had an aortic rupture, so he had
an emergency operation at the prison.

257
00:26:04.927 --> 00:26:08.334
But his liver was damaged, so the
chance of gangrene of the liver is high.

258
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.187
- What about his vitals?
- Vi... vitals?

259
00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:16.092
Both his blood pressure
and pulse are unstable.

260
00:26:16.092 --> 00:26:19.004
- Call Center Chief Go right away.
- Okay.

261
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.459
A simultaneous transplant?

262
00:26:31.459 --> 00:26:35.238
Are you saying that you'll do
three transplants at once?

263
00:26:35.238 --> 00:26:37.302
Yes, that's right.

264
00:26:37.302 --> 00:26:39.535
I've heard of liver
and pancreas transplants

265
00:26:39.535 --> 00:26:41.713
but I've never heard
of a small intestine transplant.

266
00:26:41.713 --> 00:26:44.640
Procedures transplanting
three organs at once

267
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.712
are quite rare,
so it won't sound familiar.

268
00:26:48.712 --> 00:26:50.930
Then...

269
00:26:51.896 --> 00:26:54.427
And the simultaneous transplant

270
00:26:54.427 --> 00:26:57.860
of the liver, pancreas and small
intestine has never been done before.

271
00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.331
Wait, are you saying that
you're going to do a surgery

272
00:27:01.331 --> 00:27:03.364
you've never done before?

273
00:27:04.594 --> 00:27:07.302
This surgery is the only way.

274
00:27:07.302 --> 00:27:10.262
But what if something goes wrong?

275
00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:11.940
Will you take the responsibility?

276
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.299
- Honey.
- Let's go to another hospital.

277
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:18.231
It's not like this is
the only hospital. What is this crap?

278
00:27:19.478 --> 00:27:21.112
Honey!

279
00:27:32.795 --> 00:27:36.466
- Hello?
- Yes, come to the V.I.P room right away.

280
00:27:36.466 --> 00:27:38.928
The congressman is here.

281
00:27:44.656 --> 00:27:47.939
<i>Center Chief Go, we have
a patient with aortic rupture in the ER</i>

282
00:27:47.939 --> 00:27:50.851
<i>- and his liver is bleeding.</i>
- Okay, how's his condition?

283
00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:54.784
He suffered one cardiac arrest,
and his blood pressure is still unstable.

284
00:27:54.784 --> 00:27:56.410
I got it.

285
00:28:05.469 --> 00:28:07.497
<i>[Class 3 Electrolytes]</i>

286
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:11.077
What is this?
Was he stabbed with a knife?

287
00:28:11.077 --> 00:28:15.233
No, he was sent from a prison.
He was stabbed with a piece of glass.

288
00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:18.313
- A prison?
- The guys at the ER

289
00:28:18.313 --> 00:28:19.891
said that he's a murderer.

290
00:28:19.891 --> 00:28:21.341
So?

291
00:28:21.341 --> 00:28:23.391
It's nothing.

292
00:28:33.223 --> 00:28:35.899
Why isn't the center chief here yet?

293
00:28:36.668 --> 00:28:39.530
Yes, I'll give him another call.

294
00:28:48.164 --> 00:28:51.968
The center chief is
preparing for surgery right now.

295
00:28:51.968 --> 00:28:55.431
- What surgery?
- A patient with an abdominal wound.

296
00:28:55.431 --> 00:28:58.005
<i>That criminal who was sent
from Shingwang Prison?</i>

297
00:28:58.005 --> 00:29:00.592
- Yes.
<i>- Is he out of his mind?</i>

298
00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:03.466
<i>The congressman is here!
Why did he go there?</i>

299
00:29:07.923 --> 00:29:10.223
Doesn't his heart look a bit too small?

300
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.216
- It also seems a bit discolored.
- What about the moisture?

301
00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:19.844
There's almost none.

302
00:29:21.071 --> 00:29:24.543
First, control the bleeding,
and give it some time.

303
00:29:24.543 --> 00:29:25.770
Yes, Sir.

304
00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:41.321
Geez, these people.

305
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:44.025
I told them we had the congressman here.

306
00:29:44.025 --> 00:29:46.072
What is it? Did he say he can't come?

307
00:29:46.072 --> 00:29:48.783
He just started surgery on an ER patient.

308
00:29:48.783 --> 00:29:50.883
Wh... what did you say?

309
00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.203
He's performing another surgery?

310
00:29:53.203 --> 00:29:55.709
Well... yes.

311
00:29:56.757 --> 00:30:00.196
Who's more important than
a member of the National Assembly?

312
00:30:01.206 --> 00:30:04.276
Well... I think that

313
00:30:04.276 --> 00:30:07.430
we should let Doctor Lee operate.

314
00:30:08.687 --> 00:30:13.094
Like the center chief, he's double
board certified in abdominal surgery

315
00:30:13.094 --> 00:30:16.089
and more importantly,
he's the director's son

316
00:30:16.089 --> 00:30:18.572
so he's very skilled.

317
00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:23.371
He's the director's son?

318
00:30:31.312 --> 00:30:35.375
He's my son, but he's
much more skilled than I am.

319
00:30:37.914 --> 00:30:39.927
I'm begging you.

320
00:30:39.927 --> 00:30:43.944
Please make him better.

321
00:31:25.089 --> 00:31:28.408
Did you say that
this was done in a prison?

322
00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:32.746
That's not all. He even found
a piece of glass inside him.

323
00:31:32.746 --> 00:31:34.967
I doubt that he even had the equipment.

324
00:31:34.967 --> 00:31:37.438
They said that he removed
a piece of glass from his liver.

325
00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:39.898
I'm completely baffled by this.

326
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:43.029
How did he find the glass
in his liver with just his eyes?

327
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:46.389
This isn't "The Six Million
Dollar Man" or something.

328
00:31:47.036 --> 00:31:51.036
It's an acquired ability.
According to academic records

329
00:31:51.036 --> 00:31:55.265
a mathematician by the name
of J. Spacey was in a similar situation.

330
00:31:55.265 --> 00:31:59.247
Due to an impact to the brain,
a particular ability was enhanced

331
00:31:59.247 --> 00:32:01.699
giving him a special gift.

332
00:32:01.699 --> 00:32:05.504
So that child acquired
an advanced sense of sight.

333
00:32:08.962 --> 00:32:11.895
- Shingwang Prison?
- Yes.

334
00:32:21.632 --> 00:32:23.158
Bovie.

335
00:32:25.664 --> 00:32:27.148
Suture.

336
00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:41.371
Cut.

337
00:32:51.935 --> 00:32:53.303
Cut.

338
00:32:59.267 --> 00:33:00.909
It's all done.

339
00:33:04.198 --> 00:33:05.698
- That's all.
- Okay.

340
00:33:05.698 --> 00:33:06.997
Thank you.

341
00:33:09.985 --> 00:33:12.553
You're better than the
last doctor that was here.

342
00:33:16.714 --> 00:33:18.214
Wait.

343
00:33:18.214 --> 00:33:22.597
Have you felt tired
or lethargic for no reason lately?

344
00:33:23.161 --> 00:33:25.844
- Yeah.
- Do you often experience itchiness

345
00:33:25.844 --> 00:33:27.651
and have a hard time digesting?

346
00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:30.636
How did you know that?

347
00:33:30.636 --> 00:33:34.995
You have jaundice, which suggests
a problem with liver function.

348
00:33:34.995 --> 00:33:38.228
So if it's okay with you, I'd like
to draw some blood before you go.

349
00:33:38.228 --> 00:33:40.429
But I don't think you need to worry.

350
00:33:40.429 --> 00:33:43.517
I'll prescribe you some medicine
once the results are out

351
00:33:43.517 --> 00:33:45.025
so remember to take it.

352
00:33:45.725 --> 00:33:49.776
And if the affected area feels
itchy or hot, come and see me.

353
00:33:51.237 --> 00:33:54.386
This patient needs to be treated
every day for the time being.

354
00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:55.942
Yes, Sir.

355
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.850
<i>Bring back my dad! Bring back my dad!</i>

356
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.132
<i>Bring back my dad! My dad!</i>

357
00:34:24.618 --> 00:34:27.310
This area is restricted!

358
00:34:27.966 --> 00:34:30.288
Please stay back!

359
00:34:30.288 --> 00:34:33.620
Please stay back, everyone!

360
00:34:37.232 --> 00:34:39.194
We found it!

361
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.522
Get a photo of that. Don't miss it.

362
00:34:49.485 --> 00:34:51.091
Dad.

363
00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:56.051
<i>Make lots of money, okay?</i>

364
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:16.866
Dad.

365
00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:47.243
I think his organs were removed.

366
00:35:47.243 --> 00:35:48.788
This bastard...

367
00:35:50.837 --> 00:35:52.679
Dad.

368
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:59.822
You targeted him, didn't it?

369
00:36:02.621 --> 00:36:06.076
Why did you do this
to a perfectly healthy person?

370
00:36:06.688 --> 00:36:09.562
- Why do you think?
- What?

371
00:36:10.245 --> 00:36:12.623
It's obvious.

372
00:36:12.623 --> 00:36:14.023
Money.

373
00:36:15.413 --> 00:36:17.139
That's right.

374
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.228
He had a rare blood type,
so he was worth a lot.

375
00:36:27.094 --> 00:36:28.697
Dad.

376
00:36:36.081 --> 00:36:38.148
Geez, seriously.

377
00:36:46.266 --> 00:36:48.978
Hey, Punk! Hey! Hey!

378
00:36:48.978 --> 00:36:51.609
Bring back my dad! Bring back my dad!

379
00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:54.581
Who do you think you are?
Bring back my dad!

380
00:36:54.581 --> 00:36:58.185
Bring back my dad! Let go of me!

381
00:36:58.185 --> 00:37:00.333
Bring back my dad!

382
00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:03.748
I told you to bring back my dad! My dad!

383
00:37:03.748 --> 00:37:06.216
Let go! Let go of me!

384
00:37:06.216 --> 00:37:08.618
Let go of me!

385
00:37:08.618 --> 00:37:11.174
Geez, that son of a bitch.

386
00:37:13.848 --> 00:37:17.888
Let go of me! Let go of me!

387
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.206
- Who do you think you are?
- This bastard.

388
00:37:32.206 --> 00:37:33.967
What did you do?

389
00:38:00.985 --> 00:38:02.422
Are you okay?

390
00:38:11.777 --> 00:38:13.661
In Kyu!

391
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.639
In Kyu!

392
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:19.540
In Kyu!

393
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.371
In Kyu! In Kyu.

394
00:38:29.371 --> 00:38:31.460
In Kyu, are you all right?

395
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.580
In Kyu, are you all right?

396
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.009
In Kyu.

397
00:38:37.654 --> 00:38:39.549
Do you recognize me?

398
00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:45.371
- Mister.
- Yeah, it's me.

399
00:39:22.261 --> 00:39:24.716
<i>You may be walking out today...</i>

400
00:39:24.716 --> 00:39:27.295
<i>but next time, you'll crawl out...</i>

401
00:39:27.295 --> 00:39:29.504
<i>The time after that,
you'll be on your back...</i>

402
00:39:29.504 --> 00:39:34.270
<i>in so much pain that
you'll be begging me to kill you.</i>

403
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.069
<i>Because my prescriptions</i>

404
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:39.476
<i>will slowly destroy your body.</i>

405
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.877
The blood flow to the
affected area is too low.

406
00:39:50.877 --> 00:39:53.703
- He hasn't urinated yet, either.
- What about the BP?

407
00:39:53.703 --> 00:39:57.058
Both his blood pressure and pulse are
fast, and his temperature is high too.

408
00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:01.993
His wounds may be deep, but he
gave him too much medication.

409
00:40:01.993 --> 00:40:04.333
The patient already had
a poorly-functioning heart.

410
00:40:04.333 --> 00:40:08.400
Put him on the KONOS waiting list
again, and watch over this condition.

411
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.837
Is there a need
for a transplant? He's a criminal.

412
00:40:11.837 --> 00:40:13.938
Aren't criminals people too?

413
00:40:15.092 --> 00:40:16.654
I apologize.

414
00:40:20.859 --> 00:40:22.770
- Wrap it up.
- Yes, Sir.

415
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.261
Okay.

416
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:28.935
Hello, Professor.
I just wanted to ask you

417
00:40:28.935 --> 00:40:31.685
about Resident Doctor
Kang In Kyu, from your hospital.

418
00:40:31.685 --> 00:40:34.081
Did he quit, by any chance?

419
00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:35.893
When was that?

420
00:40:35.893 --> 00:40:39.237
Did he tell you where he was going?

421
00:40:39.237 --> 00:40:43.382
Yes, I'll call you back
during my time off then.

422
00:40:43.382 --> 00:40:44.712
Bye.

423

425

<i>[2018, Hiring Notice
for Medical Chief at Shingwang Prison]</i>

426
00:41:15.511 --> 00:41:17.346
So he went there after all.

427
00:41:26.232 --> 00:41:29.315
Please inject him with some fluids
and conduct a hemodialysis.

428
00:41:29.315 --> 00:41:30.536
Okay.

429
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:45.951
What's his condition right now?

430
00:41:48.288 --> 00:41:52.462
He has hepatic encephalopathy due to
an acute drug-induced liver failure

431
00:41:52.462 --> 00:41:54.556
so he needs a liver transplant.

432
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.212
His liver and heart at the same time?

433
00:41:58.212 --> 00:42:02.094
Yes, there's no other way.

434
00:42:02.777 --> 00:42:07.371
Geez, we can't even
get a heart, what will we do?

435
00:42:09.283 --> 00:42:12.480
What is his MELD score?
(Scale rating need for liver transplant.)

436
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.721
At the moment, his MELD score is 37.

437
00:42:18.092 --> 00:42:20.741
If his MELD score was increased

438
00:42:20.741 --> 00:42:23.719
he'd be registered as
a more urgent patient.

439
00:42:23.719 --> 00:42:27.670
Wouldn't we be able
to register him for KONOS then?

440
00:42:30.545 --> 00:42:32.408
No, according to regulations--

441
00:42:32.408 --> 00:42:34.384
Oh, yes.

442
00:42:36.777 --> 00:42:38.775
We'll do that.

443
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:55.346
Are you going to change the MELD score
regardless of the test results?

444
00:42:55.346 --> 00:42:57.353
He's a congressman.

445
00:42:57.353 --> 00:43:01.735
This is preferential treatment.
No, this is fabrication.

446
00:43:01.735 --> 00:43:05.306
You know that most patients
wait years for their transplants.

447
00:43:05.306 --> 00:43:08.402
- That's their life.
- Father!

448
00:43:16.364 --> 00:43:18.558
This is the logic of power.

449
00:43:18.558 --> 00:43:20.725
Bury your pride.

450
00:43:21.346 --> 00:43:23.975
If you don't want to stay
at the bottom forever

451
00:43:23.975 --> 00:43:26.462
learn how to operate
from the center chief.

452
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:30.821
I'll keep this position
until you're ready to take over.

453
00:43:52.197 --> 00:43:55.255
Do you have any idea
when we registered for a transplant?

454
00:43:55.255 --> 00:43:57.370
How long do I have to wait?

455
00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.212
Madam, I fully understand how you feel

456
00:44:00.212 --> 00:44:03.190
but other patients also
wait years for their transplants.

457
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.341
And you've only been waiting
for a month, Madam.

458
00:44:07.882 --> 00:44:10.706
Is my husband at the same
level as those people?

459
00:44:10.706 --> 00:44:14.556
He's a congressman in his third term.
He's a candidate for the next term!

460
00:44:14.556 --> 00:44:17.324
So he should be top priority!

461
00:44:17.324 --> 00:44:20.623
Preferential! Don't you know?

462
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:24.676
Lady!

463
00:44:25.587 --> 00:44:27.793
Don't you see this sign
telling you to be quiet?

464
00:44:27.793 --> 00:44:29.598
Silence?

465
00:44:31.915 --> 00:44:34.080
What the heck is that?

466
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.835
No, I'm not "that," I'm a person.

467
00:44:36.835 --> 00:44:40.614
And I'm the transplantation
coordinator here, okay?

468
00:44:42.299 --> 00:44:47.375
Or... or... organ, what?

469
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:54.043
I'm the organ transplant coordinator.

470
00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:59.902
You shouldn't make noise in a hospital.
People will cuss at you

471
00:44:59.902 --> 00:45:01.728
and call you ignorant.

472
00:45:03.879 --> 00:45:07.029
Hey! Do you know who I am?

473
00:45:07.029 --> 00:45:08.987
- I don't.
- I'm

474
00:45:08.987 --> 00:45:12.116
Congressman Noh Jin Tae's wife.

475
00:45:12.116 --> 00:45:14.139
- So?
- What?

476
00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:15.183
"So?"

477
00:45:15.183 --> 00:45:18.071
If you're a congressman's wife,
you should have some dignity.

478
00:45:18.071 --> 00:45:21.371
Why are you yelling
for everyone to hear?

479
00:45:27.087 --> 00:45:31.627
We'll call you once
you're selected, so wait at home.

480
00:45:36.949 --> 00:45:40.949
Madam, you were here?

481
00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:44.181
Chief Director, I'm glad you're here.

482
00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:48.199
Who is she? Why is she so confident?

483
00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:52.096
Oh, don't worry about her.
She's our new transplant coordinator

484
00:45:52.096 --> 00:45:55.179
but she studied abroad, you see.

485
00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:57.315
And, here I thought...

486
00:45:57.315 --> 00:45:58.658
Hey.

487
00:46:01.529 --> 00:46:05.105
If you studied abroad,
you should have stayed there.

488
00:46:05.105 --> 00:46:08.737
Why did you crawl back here
to stir up a fuss?

489
00:46:08.737 --> 00:46:09.998
You little...

490
00:46:09.998 --> 00:46:12.846
This lady, seriously! Look here!

491
00:46:12.846 --> 00:46:14.922
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

492
00:46:14.922 --> 00:46:17.723
Then, let's get going.

493
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:21.860
Let's go. Let's go. Follow me!
Follow me! Follow me!

494
00:46:27.141 --> 00:46:30.658
We moved the congressman up the list

495
00:46:30.658 --> 00:46:33.630
but there are too many names
on the list, so there isn't much hope.

496
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.187
- Goodness.
- And even if he's selected

497
00:46:36.187 --> 00:46:40.114
it's not just a heart transplant,
but a liver transplant as well.

498
00:46:41.004 --> 00:46:43.935
Gosh, what do we do then?

499
00:46:46.775 --> 00:46:50.985
As of right now, a transplant
from a family member is the only way.

500
00:46:50.985 --> 00:46:54.264
We can't do that. Not our children, okay?

501
00:46:54.264 --> 00:46:58.935
He wouldn't want any wounds
on our kids, I don't want that either.

502
00:47:01.331 --> 00:47:06.563
I'm sure you know that everyday life
is possible with just half a heart...

503
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:11.922
and livers regenerate quickly,
so just leaving a third of it

504
00:47:11.922 --> 00:47:16.116
results in full recovery for both
the donor and recipient.

505
00:47:16.116 --> 00:47:18.513
You can't touch the kids, I said.

506
00:47:19.188 --> 00:47:21.610
Okay, then.

507
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.799
How about other relatives?

508
00:47:25.072 --> 00:47:30.716
A wife, a lineal ascendant,
descendant, a sibling, or a cousin.

509
00:47:30.716 --> 00:47:33.563
They're our enemies.

510
00:47:33.563 --> 00:47:37.768
They're all useless. We haven't
even talked to them in ages.

511
00:47:41.893 --> 00:47:43.453
Well...

512
00:47:44.982 --> 00:47:49.254
if a voluntary donor is confirmed...

513
00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:55.234
other people could do it too.

Ignore him.

Nothing good will
come out of keeping him close.

530

Pretend that you don't
see or know anything.

531
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.130
The secret is to live like you're dead.

532
00:50:35.837 --> 00:50:38.344
And don't do anything dangerous,
like you did yesterday.

533
00:50:38.344 --> 00:50:40.792
I hate when it gets noisy.

534
00:51:06.712 --> 00:51:09.917
At your age, you shouldn't
work until you collapse.

535
00:51:09.917 --> 00:51:11.525
Take it easy.

536
00:51:11.525 --> 00:51:16.004
What's the point of resting?
I should make as much money as I can.

537
00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:22.014
When I was out there, I gave
my daughter a really hard time.

538
00:51:22.014 --> 00:51:24.292
But when I found out that I
may not have much time to live...

539
00:51:24.292 --> 00:51:27.408
all I can think of is
my daughter, after coming here.

540
00:51:27.408 --> 00:51:32.692
That's why I want to at least
leave some money for her.

541
00:51:32.692 --> 00:51:35.449
Although it won't be much.

542
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.304
Hello?

543
00:51:41.953 --> 00:51:43.824
Yes.

544
00:51:43.824 --> 00:51:46.735
Doctor! It's Goil Hospital.

545
00:51:46.735 --> 00:51:49.466
They said that Prisoner Park Sung Pil
is attached to a machine

546
00:51:49.466 --> 00:51:51.433
because he can't breathe on his own.

547
00:51:57.451 --> 00:52:02.138
Yes, this is the medical chief,
Baek Ji Nam. What happened?

548
00:52:02.772 --> 00:52:04.143
Yes.

549
00:52:06.364 --> 00:52:08.355
A postanoxic coma?

550
00:52:10.364 --> 00:52:13.783
I understand. I'll head over right away.

551
00:52:17.842 --> 00:52:19.735
What did he say?

552
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.978
I guess he arrived too late.

553
00:52:23.978 --> 00:52:26.906
He has hypoxia and brain damage.

554
00:52:26.906 --> 00:52:29.054
What do we do?

555
00:52:29.054 --> 00:52:31.616
He was a good person.

556
00:52:43.909 --> 00:52:47.641
First, call KONOS, since he was
on the list to be an organ donor.

557
00:52:47.641 --> 00:52:50.900
Goil Hospital already called them.

558
00:52:52.966 --> 00:52:55.156
- Let's go.
- Okay.

559
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:22.842
I'll go with you this time, but you'll
go alone with the nurse next time.

560
00:53:22.842 --> 00:53:26.161
But... did you get the family's consent?

561
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:30.572
We need their consent, even if he was
on the list to be an organ donor.

562
00:53:30.572 --> 00:53:31.975
Their consent?

563
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:40.648
They already gave their consent

564
00:53:40.648 --> 00:53:44.947
and asked KONOS to take care
of all administrative matters.

565
00:53:53.909 --> 00:53:57.094
The man was imprisoned because
he didn't have 1.5 million won.

566
00:53:57.094 --> 00:54:01.241
His kids didn't even pay for that,
so why would they care about this?

567
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:04.755
Let's go.

568
00:54:20.746 --> 00:54:22.741
<i>Cheers!</i>

569
00:54:26.601 --> 00:54:29.375

570
00:54:31.321 --> 00:54:35.350
Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys are too much!
You excluded me! Geez, seriously!

571

Wow, this looks delicious.

572
00:54:37.918 --> 00:54:41.389

too lacking as drinking snacks?

573

574

575
00:54:48.192 --> 00:54:51.118
- Hey, but why did you come here?
- Why else?

576
00:54:51.118 --> 00:54:53.668
I saw you harassing the kids,
so I came to save them.

577
00:54:53.668 --> 00:54:57.304
I wasn't harassing anyone.
Hey, was I harassing you?

578
00:54:57.304 --> 00:54:59.438
- No, Sir!
- See?

579
00:54:59.438 --> 00:55:01.433
You're harassing them
right now, Center Chief.

580
00:55:01.433 --> 00:55:05.527
Why are you even here?
Give them your card or drink together.

581
00:55:05.527 --> 00:55:07.520
- Geez.
- I'll pour it for you.

582
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.408
Hey, that's okay. Don't overdo it.

583
00:55:09.408 --> 00:55:13.255
Geez, seriously. Why are you
drinking water at a bar, like a loser?

584
00:55:13.255 --> 00:55:15.982
Hey, order another drink
so we can have a toast.

585
00:55:15.982 --> 00:55:18.045

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:59.264
and said that they have a donor
for Patient Kim Soon Nam.

595

Really?

599

He had hypoxia and

00:56:14.042 --> 00:56:16.880
and was a prisoner at Shingwang Prison.

Shingwang Prison... the place that sent
the patient with the abdomen wound?

Yes.

- Why?

617

Am I not allowed to go?

618
00:57:23.176 --> 00:57:25.092
You were just at a company dinner though.

619
00:57:25.092 --> 00:57:28.172
And isn't it weird for the
center chief to personally go?

620
00:57:31.254 --> 00:57:33.384
Get in. It's cold.

621
00:57:33.384 --> 00:57:35.933
I bet you didn't have dinner yet either.

622
00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:58.429
Should I buy some kimbap,
a hamburger, or a snack?

623
00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:00.121
I'm fine.

00:58:05.692 --> 00:58:08.545
The surgery needs to go well.

627
00:58:10.893 --> 00:58:13.911
I haven't had dinner yet either.

628
00:58:13.911 --> 00:58:15.712
You can eat during the extraction.

629
00:58:15.712 --> 00:58:18.023
You won't have anything
to do then anyway.

630

Are you sure that I'm your daughter?

631
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.786
What?

632
00:58:29.786 --> 00:58:32.299
I ran around all day

633
00:58:32.299 --> 00:58:36.373
and haven't had dinner, let alone
gone home, is that right to say?

634
00:58:37.295 --> 00:58:40.308
I told you to eat because you hadn't.
Did I do something wrong?

635
00:58:40.308 --> 00:58:42.025
Do you think I was
just talking about myself?

636
00:58:42.025 --> 00:58:44.764
I said that because
I want to eat together.

637
00:58:52.772 --> 00:58:55.455
Do you know what Mom said
while she was alive?

638
00:58:56.382 --> 00:58:58.980
She said that you wouldn't
have gotten divorced

639
00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.937
if you treated us half
as well as you treat your patients.

640
00:59:03.726 --> 00:59:06.241
Think about us from time to time.

641
00:59:08.335 --> 00:59:12.411
Think about Mom,
who passed away, and me too.

642
00:59:48.969 --> 00:59:51.802
Chief, Center Chief Go is here.

643
00:59:58.978 --> 01:00:00.801
- Hello.
- Hello.

644
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:03.139
I see you came here yourself.

645
01:00:03.139 --> 01:00:06.629
- Yes, thank you for your hard work.
- No problem.

646
01:00:06.629 --> 01:00:09.462
Please go inside. They're all waiting.

647
01:00:09.462 --> 01:00:10.951
Okay.

648
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:15.955
Oh, may I borrow this friend?

649
01:00:15.955 --> 01:00:17.324
Pardon?

650
01:00:17.324 --> 01:00:21.739
My team is at a company dinner tonight,
so I came without an assistant.

651
01:00:21.739 --> 01:00:24.074
Oh, sure. Please do that.

652
01:00:24.074 --> 01:00:26.496
Doctor Kang is a surgeon too.

653
01:00:26.496 --> 01:00:28.245
I'd like to refuse.

654
01:00:30.203 --> 01:00:33.998
I came to deliver the patient,
not to extract the organs.

655
01:00:36.757 --> 01:00:40.629
What's wrong, Doctor Kang?
You're being rude.

656
01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:44.534
Why don't you come in
so that you don't regret it?

657
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.739
I came here to see you.

658
01:00:48.315 --> 01:00:50.929
I felt like this was
the only way I could see you.

659
01:01:17.712 --> 01:01:19.266
Deaver.

660
01:01:22.773 --> 01:01:24.167
Forceps.

661
01:01:26.321 --> 01:01:27.754
Metzen.

662
01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:36.312
Bovie.

663
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:44.466
Metzen.

664
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.737
It seems like they know
each other, doesn't it?

665
01:01:56.386 --> 01:01:58.592
It seems that way, doesn't it?

666
01:02:00.563 --> 01:02:02.645
Is it a teacher-student relationship?

667
01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:07.466
If not, is it
a senior-junior relationship?

668
01:02:13.455 --> 01:02:18.163
In any case, they don't seem
to have a good relationship.

669
01:02:18.163 --> 01:02:21.826
I know, right? It seems that way.

670
01:02:32.835 --> 01:02:35.710
It was a good call,
holding the artery first.

671
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.839
You did a good job too.

672
01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:40.402
But you injected too much medicine.

673
01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:44.167
So much that the patient who
already suffered from a bad heart

674
01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:46.489
couldn't recover from it.

675
01:02:51.741 --> 01:02:53.042
Didn't you know?

676
01:02:53.739 --> 01:02:56.725
The patient you sent to the hospital
with an aortic rupture

677
01:02:56.725 --> 01:02:58.603
is in a coma right now.

678
01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:03.812
You gave too much medicine
to a patient with a bad heart

679
01:03:03.812 --> 01:03:06.170
and even injected him
with Hartmann's solution.

680
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:09.411
- I handled it perfectly.
- No.

681
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.181
It was very bad.

682
01:03:11.181 --> 01:03:13.926
I did the best I could at the time.

683
01:03:13.926 --> 01:03:17.159
The best effort made by an unskilled
doctor is poison to the patient.

684
01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:21.091
If you want to be
a real doctor, study under me.

685
01:03:23.346 --> 01:03:24.960
I don't want to.

686
01:03:25.706 --> 01:03:29.004
Why? Because of Kim Hyung Bum?

687
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:32.741
I'm different from other doctors.

688
01:03:32.741 --> 01:03:35.353
I didn't become a doctor to save people.

689
01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:38.047
I did it to kill people, to get revenge.

690
01:03:38.712 --> 01:03:43.194
Are you going to ruin your life
because of a grudge?

691
01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:46.081
My life is already over anyway.

692
01:03:46.081 --> 01:03:48.485
<i>The day In Joo died...</i>

693
01:03:48.485 --> 01:03:50.812
<i>after Dad passed away.</i>

694
01:03:52.569 --> 01:03:55.980
Why did you donate her organs
without my permission?

695
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.447
Why?

696
01:03:58.951 --> 01:04:01.480
Doctors are dead in the heart.

697
01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.284
Let's let In Joo live on
in someone else's body.

698
01:04:04.284 --> 01:04:08.562
What's the point in that?
In Joo is dead already!

699
01:04:14.085 --> 01:04:16.652
Didn't you say you wanted to be a doctor?

700
01:04:17.359 --> 01:04:22.379
Then, even if it's hard,
make a rational judgement, like a doctor.

701
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:26.716
If In Joo was your daughter,
would you be able to say that?

702
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:31.261
It's because you're a stranger.
It's because you're our foster father.

703
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:35.216
We thought of you...

704
01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:38.719
as our biological father.

705
01:04:40.337 --> 01:04:45.165
I also thought of you as my own.

706
01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:48.341
Then, how could you...

707
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:52.741
leave the same wound...

708
01:04:53.951 --> 01:04:56.777
that was left on Dad?

709
01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.427
When you clearly know how Dad died!

710
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:04.793
<i>I only learned about it
after I went to medical school.</i>

711
01:05:04.793 --> 01:05:08.384
That our entire family
had a rare blood type.

712
01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.759
Then you must know

713
01:05:10.759 --> 01:05:14.395
why I had no choice
but to perform that surgery.

714
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.034
Of course.

715
01:05:17.034 --> 01:05:19.154
I know all too well.

716
01:05:21.177 --> 01:05:25.375
The reason you had to rush
to do the surgery, and...

717
01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:27.795
your motive for adopting us.

718
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.150
Motive?

719
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:37.710
A rare gastrointestinal disease
with a rare blood type.

720
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:40.498
A reattempt of a gastric
organ transplant.

721
01:05:40.498 --> 01:05:42.748
I'm sure you needed our In Joo
to regain your reputation

722
01:05:42.748 --> 01:05:44.699
after being kicked out
of Hanguk Hospital.

723
01:05:44.699 --> 01:05:46.237
Kang In Kyu!

724
01:05:51.672 --> 01:05:54.889
<i>I can't forgive the man
who killed my father...</i>

725
01:05:55.322 --> 01:05:57.042
but I can't...

726
01:05:58.067 --> 01:06:01.029
<i>forgive you for
doing that to In Joo either.</i>

727
01:06:01.569 --> 01:06:06.433
I'm going to get revenge
in the cruelest, most painful way.

728
01:06:06.433 --> 01:06:08.228
I'll do it...

729
01:06:10.313 --> 01:06:11.927
with my own hands.

730
01:06:29.132 --> 01:06:32.471
<i>[Cross]</i>

731
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:37.139
<i>If you want revenge,
do it now, in this room. Scalpel.</i>

732
01:06:37.139 --> 01:06:38.927
<i>- Who prescribed these?
- Doctor Kang.</i>

733
01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:41.297
<i>- To whom?
- 4713, Kim Hyung Bum.</i>

734
01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:44.029
<i>I told you to give
the heart to the congressman.</i>

735
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:47.572
<i>Look into what he did,
and why he crawled in here.</i>

736
01:06:47.572 --> 01:06:49.998
<i>Get out, before you start a fire.</i>

737
01:06:49.998 --> 01:06:52.371
<i>The truth is, the bastard I stabbed...</i>

738
01:06:52.371 --> 01:06:55.105
<i>- Oh my gosh!
- What happened?</i>

739
01:06:55.105 --> 01:06:56.871
<i>What do you plan on doing?</i>

740
01:06:56.871 --> 01:06:59.072
<i>How do you know the center chief?</i>

741
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.873
<i>You knew all along, didn't you, Mister?</i>
