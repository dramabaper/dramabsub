00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.011
(Episode 22)

2
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.881
I don't know the story,

3
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.921
but you shouldn't make him wait for too long.

4
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:50.411
The person you have reached is not available.

5
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:57.561
(2 Missed Calls, 1 Text)

6
00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.820
(It's Ji A. I'm in Geoje Island. Min Kyu is here.)

7
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.661
It's Ji A. I'm in Geoje Island.

8
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.161
Min Kyu is here.

9
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.760
He hasn't found out, but what should I do?

10
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:21.780
What is it that you want to say?

11
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:29.851
(Doctor Hong Baek Gyoon)

12
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:33.420
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

13
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.590
What is it this time?

14
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.391
Min Kyu and Ji A are together.

15
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.200
- What? - My gosh.

16
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.101
Doctor Oh.

17
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:48.641
Min Kyu's with Ji A right now.

18
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.611
What? Where? How?

19
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.741
No, wait. Can you reach Ms. Jo right now?

20
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.950
You can't get a hold of her?

21
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.280
If you do, tell her this.

22
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.021
Tell her to keep it a secret no matter what.

23
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.551
She needs to pretend like she wasn't Aji 3.

24
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.260
Tell her not to say or do anything that could remind him of Aji 3.

25
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.491
I...

26
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.231
recently lost...

27
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.701
a friend.

28
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.671
That friend...

29
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:21.641
helped me come out from the dark...

30
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.880
after 15 years.

31
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:28.211
Sorry to hear that.

32
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.120
But what exactly does that have to do with me?

33
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.821
You feel...

34
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:39.160
very similar to that friend.

35
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:51.000
Sometimes,

36
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.611
absurd things tend to happen in this world.

37
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.711
Things people can't believe...

38
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:01.680
unless they actually experience them.

39
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.511
That friend and I...

40
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.350
experienced that miraculous moment...

41
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.650
together.

42
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.961
I don't understand.

43
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Hey.

44
00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:25.840
You should seriously go to the hospital.

45
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.071
I'll tell you the address of a nearby hospital.

46
00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:30.541
You should go now.

47
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.880
This is what I used to say to her. "Hi."

48
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.120
"Aji 3".

49
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.731
I finally understand why you're being like this.

50
00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.611
Are you acquainted with Doctor Hong Baek Gyoon?

51
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:03.771
You know him.

52
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:07.981
Then you must know Aji 3 is a robot.

53
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.280
Do you know this?

54
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.921
If you happen to meet Min Kyu again,

55
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.220
tell him this.

56
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.160
I was that robot's character model.

57
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.391
He paid me 10,000 dollars for the job 4 years ago.

58
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.761
The person standing before you is whom?

59
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:28.131
Not a robot but a person, okay?

60
00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:31.001
I know that you were a character model.

61
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:33.040
You know that much and...

62
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.771
you make me feel uncomfortable by being so rude?

63
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.711
I apologize.

64
00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:43.081
Then get out.

65
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:44.480
Sorry.

66
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.720
If you feel sorry, get out.

67
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.621
Can't I stay and just look at you?

68
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.931
When I get tired of that,

69
00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:55.860
I'll see myself out.

70
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.501
You want to... You'll look at me?

71
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.771
Why would you do that?

72
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:05.900
I just...

73
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:08.410
It's just...

74
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.311
so fascinating.

75
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.110
- Get up. - What?

76
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.451
Get up before I drag you outside.

77
00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:19.420
Wait, wait, Hong Joo, wait.

78
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.751
Hong Joo, wait.

79
00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:23.350
You psychopath, what do you want to look at?

80
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.490
Are you a rising star of the stalker world?

81
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.261
You're laughing?

82
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.441
You still haven't learned your lesson.

83
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.641
Listen up.

84
00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:40.540
My face is mine,

85
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.670
and the robot you're thinking of isn't me.

86
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.081
I shouldn't have taken that part-time job.

87
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:49.511
I had no idea such a weirdo would end up following me.

88
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.951
Do you know how scary it is when a stranger...

89
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:56.621
shows up acting like you met before?

90
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.860
- Give me a room. - What?

91
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.030
It's a homestay.

92
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.160
Give me a room to spend the night in.

93
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.530
Will you please get lost?

94
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.600
No. We're full.

95
00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:11.740
It looks like you're empty.

96
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.540
I...

97
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.941
Hong...

98
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.780
I'll go too.

99
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.941
- Me too. - Me too.

100
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.910
- You stay. - Stay and watch the lab.

101
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:24.951
We...

102
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.521
Don't get hacked again.

103
00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:28.990
Come on...

104
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.160
How come she's with our brother?

105
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.730
I have no idea.

106
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.461
Do you think something will happen?

107
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:40.261
Pai.

108
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.871
You haven't slept properly in days.

109
00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:48.170
What if you doze off at the wheel?

110
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.511
If you want to go, take me with you.

111
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.610
If not, you aren't going either.

112
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.711
Never ever.

113
00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:57.081
She's so stubborn.

114
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:11.501
Sun Hye, where on Geoje Island is Ji A?

115
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:16.400
The call cannot be connected.

116
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.610
(Doctor Oh)

117
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.641
Do you think Ji A put on a strong defense?

118
00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:31.081
The probability of her being successful is below 10 percent,

119
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:34.050
but Min Kyu's cluelessness could be a strong variable.

120
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.050
I calculate that will raise the success rate to 30 percent.

121
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.561
Another variable, Ji A's unpredictable actions,

122
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.230
will bring it down to 15 percent.

123
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.331
No, that variable is so strong that...

124
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:45.400
it will stay controlled up to 25 percent.

125
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:47.331
15 percent.

126
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:50.001
- 25 percent. - 15 percent.

127
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:51.100
25.

128
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.821
He's like a leech. He just won't let go.

129
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.230
- Sun Hye. - Why didn't you pick up?

130
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.501
What happened?

131
00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:21.230
I kicked him out for now.

132
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.240
I gave Fungus Guy your address. He'll be on his way.

133
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.910
Can he come here?

134
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.840
We must be there.

135
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.610
Did you say you were a character model?

136
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.581
Yes, I think he believed that.

137
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.610
Listen carefully.

138
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.980
You called me out of anger about Min Kyu,

139
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.520
and we're coming over.

140
00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:42.520
If he bothers you again, be angry.

141
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.691
I am being angry.

142
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.220
It's not working.

143
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.090
It's like he doesn't understand the words I'm saying.

144
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.331
Be as angry as you can be.

145
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:51.760
Doctor Oh said this.

146
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.071
Don't say or do anything you said or did as Aji 3.

147
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.071
Okay, I'll be careful.

148
00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:59.541
Should I just run away?

149
00:08:59.541 --> 00:09:01.470
Min Kyu's IQ is 159.

150
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.340
I guarantee that he'll suspect you as soon as you disappear.

151
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.850
It's suffocating. I can't breathe like this.

152
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.250
It's a homestay, right?

153
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.951
Lock yourself in a room until we get there.

154
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.120
Okay.

155
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.720
How could something like this happen?

156
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.860
- Hong Joo. - My goodness gracious.

157
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:29.531
(Santa Maria, Daeyang Shipbuilding)

158
00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:31.941
What was that? Deja vu?

159
00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:35.311
I misheard that, didn't I? Please say I did.

160
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.640
It actually happened, doctor.

161
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.911
Oh, no.

162
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.490
Aji 3...

163
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.990
did just that once.

164
00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:54.961
When we first met.

165
00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:59.331
No. Was it the second time?

166
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:04.041
Why... Why are you in here?

167
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:06.770
Oh, I left my bag and coat.

168
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.110
Take them, and get out.

169
00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:11.110
I haven't finished my sashimi.

170
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:14.350
- I'll pack the rest for you. - No, I'll eat it all here.

171
00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:16.510
We have to close.

172
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:19.520
I'll eat it all up before you do.

173
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:21.250
But...

174
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.640
Oh, dear.

175
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.181
He didn't leave. He came back in.

176
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.651
Listen to me carefully. You might as well just be yourself.

177
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:54.151
I told him Aji 3 has your face, personality, and habits.

178
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:56.250
But instead, remember this.

179
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.421
You do not know anything he said or did to you, okay?

180
00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:01.890
The second he notices, you become Aji 3.

181
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:03.130
Okay.

182
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:07.470
Thanks for the bread.

183
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.840
How are Ji A's defenses?

184
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.441
The first line is down.

185
00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:15.441
The second and last line are still secure.

186
00:11:15.671 --> 00:11:16.840
Thank you.

187
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:22.350
- Sun Hye. - I'm dieting.

188
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.691
Will Kim Min Kyu fall for the ruse from start to finish?

189
00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:30.561
He did when Ji A was the robot.

190
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:32.360
I think he will, he will.

191
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.990
He has to, right?

192
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.730
That was when he was weird because he'd been alone for so long.

193
00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:40.201
He's come leaps and bounds since then.

194
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:43.000
My heart is pounding so hard it's killing me.

195
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.470
Does he still have...

196
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.711
that clueless idiocy? That is the question.

197
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.850
Dear Dong Won, am I all you see?

198
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.520
Dear Dong Won...

199
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.291
Dear Dong Won...

200
00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:04.990
You froze. What are you doing?

201
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.890
Why are you zoning out? Get a grip.

202
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.630
Sun Hye, I was always looking at you.

203
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.000
I always see you.

204
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.730
I know, yes, thank you.

205
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.500
You knew that and...

206
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.480
Drink some water too.

207
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.250
Isn't it too dry?

208
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.890
Thank... Thank you.

209
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.791
Can you take the cart to the communal warehouse?

210
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:41.590
Woo Sik's family needs it tomorrow.

211
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.730
And bring the baskets we dry the fish in.

212
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.860
- I'll clean up here first. - Okay.

213
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.000
Ma'am.

214
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:49.701
Do you have a room?

215
00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:50.870
- No. - Yes, many.

216
00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:54.240
Which one do you want?

217
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.340
One with ocean view?

218
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:00.651
Yes.

219
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.691
Come on, show him to his room.

220
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.970
There's no bed?

221
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.010
No. You'll leave, right?

222
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.270
I'll stay.

223
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.110
There are many nicer hotels.

224
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.581
This place or a hotel, they're still worse than my room.

225
00:13:39.681 --> 00:13:43.520
He's just as mean and spiteful as always.

226
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:45.661
- Goodnight. - Wait.

227
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:47.961
So...

228
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.831
How about a coffee?

229
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:54.931
There's a vending machine outside the restaurant.

230
00:13:54.931 --> 00:13:56.630
It costs just 20 cents.

231
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.701
Wait.

232
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.370
I don't have any coins.

Hi.

236
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.350
Are you on Geoje Island?

237
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:50.051
How do you know I'm here?

238
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:52.691
I got a call from the character model.

239
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.431
She said a weirdo's calling her Aji 3.

240
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:56.990
She's scared and wants you gone.

241
00:14:57.031 --> 00:14:59.000
Is that why you called me today?

242
00:15:00.571 --> 00:15:02.730
I met her by chance on the train.

243
00:15:03.431 --> 00:15:06.140
She looks incredibly like your robot.

244
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.081
When I came to,

245
00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:13.510
I was here.

246
00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:16.281
You can't do that.

247
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.380
How shocked must she be?

248
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:22.720
Was she very shocked?

249
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.120
Of course, she was. Wouldn't you be?

250
00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:28.590
Yes, I guess you're right.

251
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:32.130
I told her the truth about...

252
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.600
why I'm here.

253
00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:35.171
This really won't do.

254
00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:37.541
I'm on my way. I'll see you there.

255
00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:39.370
What? You'll come here?

256
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.010
Do you think I can stay in Seoul when this is happening?

257
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.911
You wait right there. And leave the girl alone.

Doctor Oh, you called?

Is everything okay?

263
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:03.901
Of course.

264
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.031
Do you have your syringe and medication?

265
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.500
You must for a while, just in case.

266
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.801
No, I didn't bring anything.

267
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.541
Mr. Kim.

268
00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:17.340
Don't worry, I have everything I need.

269
00:16:39.301 --> 00:16:40.360
Mr. Jo?

270
00:16:40.931 --> 00:16:41.931
Yes, director.

271
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.970
You didn't answer your phone, so I couldn't report back.

272
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.441
You can do that later.

273
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.171
When you looked into Santa Maria,

274
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:54.211
did you find anything on Aji 3's character model?

275
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880
Is there...

276
00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.281
a human being that looks...

277
00:16:58.921 --> 00:17:00.151
just like Aji 3?

278
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.490
What?

279
00:17:02.951 --> 00:17:05.461
Her name is Hong Joo. I don't know her surname.

280
00:17:06.161 --> 00:17:07.161
Hong Joo?

281
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Me?

282
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.861
Do you remember?

283
00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:13.361
Yes.

284
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.671
Aji 3 was created based on a real person.

285
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:21.941
That much, I know for a fact.

286
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.080
I see.

If you say so,

288
00:17:28.211 --> 00:17:30.211
then it must be true.

Now.

You don't have to get angry.

305
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.441

306
00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:08.050
Okay, I will.

307

- Tell the truth. - No, really.

It's dark. I'll come along.

338
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.431
It's fine. I'll go on my own.

339
00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.431
- You, young man. - Yes?

340
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:13.300
I don't want my granddaughter to go off on her own at night.

341
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.171
Could you go with her?

342
00:21:15.171 --> 00:21:16.641
Grandma.

343
00:21:17.641 --> 00:21:20.411
That's not a problem. I have loads of time.

344
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:21.881
Let's go, Hong Joo.

345
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.181
- Grandma. - Go on.

346
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.580
Go.

347
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:48.841
From now on, I will pick you up every morning.

348
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.510
So you can save your battery.

349
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.611
Is it because...

350
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:55.851
- I'm your treasure? - No.

351
00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:58.220
Get ready to be scolded.

352
00:21:58.381 --> 00:22:00.951
It's wrong to scold without a reason, master.

353
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.060
Why did you laugh?

354
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.830
You laughed too.

355
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.060
I had a good enough reason to laugh.

356
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.000
Can you not talk to me?

357
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.631
I'm trying to drive.

358
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.601
I'm here to look after you, Hong Joo.

359
00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:20.240
Did I ask you to?

360
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.010
Technically speaking, shouldn't you be grateful?

361
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.740
Do you force people to thank you?

362
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.711
- Are you usually like this? - What's wrong with me?

363
00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:32.020
Aji 3 was rude, but she was cute.

364
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.351
Being with you...

365
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.191
is helping me realize there are differences.

366
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.990
If I stay longer,

367
00:22:39.891 --> 00:22:41.131
will I see more?

368
00:22:41.391 --> 00:22:44.330
Darn it. Should I be happy or sad?

369
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.601
Aji 3 was...

370
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.810
Are you getting your revenge by driving roughly?

371
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.411
I'm a terrible driver, that's all.

372
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.141
I left my phone in my apron.

373
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.711
Can you turn on your phone?

374
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.050
On flashlight mode.

375
00:23:36.411 --> 00:23:37.881
My battery's almost dead.

376
00:23:37.881 --> 00:23:40.520
I'll buy you a new one that's fully charged.

377
00:23:40.851 --> 00:23:42.421
Turn it on.

378
00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:49.260
Where's the basket?

379
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.601
It stinks.

380
00:24:01.871 --> 00:24:03.470
My gosh. Unbelievable.

381
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.580
They should shut the door if they're done using the storage room.

382
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.790
Wait.

383
00:24:23.131 --> 00:24:25.431
No! Wait!

384
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:27.901
I'm still inside! Excuse me!

385
00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:30.000
There's someone inside!

386
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:33.101
Excuse me!

387
00:24:33.101 --> 00:24:35.711
There's someone inside!

388
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.310
Excuse me!

389
00:24:45.381 --> 00:24:49.320
My gosh, did I seriously get locked up in this storage room with him?

390
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.891
This can't be.

391
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.931
I'll either suffocate to death...

392
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:55.661
or freeze to death before morning comes.

393
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.070
(I'm Not a Robot)

394
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.441
Do you want to be friends?

395
00:25:40.441 --> 00:25:41.770
I don't have a girlfriend.

396
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.310
I started becoming greedy.

397
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.280
Who do you miss the most right now?

398
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.780
Kim Min Kyu.

399
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.951
If I tell him everything honestly,

400
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:54.621
do you think he'll forgive me and trust me again?

401
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:56.490
Do you miss me that much?

402
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.161
But I shouldn't do that, should I?

403
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.260
Gosh, there she is.

404
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.131
I'll explain everything.

405
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:07.000
Have you been lying to me until now?
