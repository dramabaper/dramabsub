When the bell rang, he was there.

Soulmate?

Is he really my destined husband?

Can I trust this bell?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.480
Is him being my soulmate true?

26
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820
How could you pause all of a sudden?

27
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.070
I almost lost the evil spirit!

28
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.480
Ma Wang, stop playing the piano. It's all over.

29
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.720
Ma Wang, I told you to stop.

30
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.240
Ma Wang!

31
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.960
Ma Wang! Have you lost it?

32
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.500
You don't even play the piano! I told you to just play a CD.

33
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.920
It's been such a while since I played the piano! So I lost myself in playing.

34
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.430
You said it was your first time though?

35
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.640
Was it that obvious?

36
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.770
The time is up for the rental dress. Please take it off quickly.

37
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.240
Yes.

38
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.530
Why is it so poufy? It must be so uncomfortable.

39
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.010
Hey, Secretary Ma. How come you gave her a dress like that? No one wears that kind of style these days.

40
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.530
Sam Jang chose this dress.

41
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.790
I thought this was the prettiest.

42
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.410
If you put in air in your sleeve, you would fly away.

43
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.720
This style is from 30 years ago.

44
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.260
If you have a real wedding, I should choose your wedding dress.

45
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.260
It's so old-fashioned. It's hard to look at.

46
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.760
The trend these days is for the dress to be see-through and flowy.

47
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.950
Nobody wears this nowadays, this garbage.

48
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.510
Why are you guys like this?! She looks pretty, even in this garbage.

49
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.450
You're pretty, pretty. No matter what you wear, you're pretty.

50
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.030
This isn't even a real wedding. Whether I wear a who cares?

51
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.520
Since the wedding ceremony is over, we should go eat.

52
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.820
In a wedding ceremony, we should eat beef rib soup. Ma Wang, let's eat beef rib soup.

53
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.360
- I'm a bull. How dare you suggest to eat beef rib soup?
- Ah, what about beef stew?

54
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.800
- Forget it.
- Beef meat soup.

55
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800
- That's also beef!
- Alright, alright!

56
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.090
- Then beef head soup! Decided!
- Eat it by yourself!

57
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.200
Let's go!

58
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.230
I reserved a local restaurant!

59
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.290
-Ah, what a rude nutjob! Seriously.

60
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.460
- But, beef head soup is good.
- Ah! Seriously!

61
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.660
What if it were a real wedding?

62
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.580
What are you doing?

63
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.430
Do you like that dress that much?

64
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.350
You want to get married?

65
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.460
No! What wedding? Whom would I even marry?

66
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.660
We already married twice!

67
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.050
Once today, and last time.

68
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.920
Last time?

69
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.560
How was that a wedding?

70
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.330
We could do it again. I like it.

71
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.820
Come quickly.

72
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.630
No. I'm not going to marry you.

73
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.230
I'm telling you to come quickly so we can go eat at the restaurant.

74
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.740
You can marry me again. No matter how many times you come to be my bride, I'll accept you.

75
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.260
Hurry up.

76
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.590
I must have gone crazy.

77
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.760
I feel like I can hear bells ringing.

78
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.150
Ma Wang, then is Sam Jang's suffering over?

79
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.200
Ah, she says that she's come to her senses.

80
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.580
<i>Since I no longer have to worry about what will happen after the Geumganggo is taken off,</i>

81
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.050
<i>I don't have any expectations, and I feel at peace.</i>

82
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.240
Since she has no expectations from that rascal, and she feels at peace,

83
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.560
that's why she picked that kind of dress to wear.

84
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.210
If she had dressed prettily, I would have been suspicious.

85
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.000
Even though she was dressed that way, the Great Sage said she was pretty.

86
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.990
That's because the Geumganggo created an unconditional love for that rascal.

87
00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.010
"Love miniaturizes the world into that one person and love magnifies that person

88
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:06.220
to make the God. That's called love," Victor Hugo said.

89
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.140
For the Great Sage with the Geumganggo, Sam Jang was his whole universe and God.

90
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.770
Exactly. Did Victor Hugo wear the Geumganggo as well?

91
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.950
How did he know that so exactly?

92
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.210
He must have been in love.

93
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.780
Isn't that why you understand the love as well, Ma Wang?

94
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.230
Because you had a person who was your whole universe and God?

95
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:39.520
That woman who was my universe and God is probably living somewhere in this world.

96
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:47.070
This time around, what kind of painful fate must she be enduring?

97
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.050
<i>Police</i>

98
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.860
Pig, is this our first date?

99
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:18.910
Since our relationship has been exposed, you want to flirt with me in public, huh?

100
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:24.040
Octopus, we are breaking up here.

101
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.590
Pick any man you like here and you change to date with him.

102
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.350
If you need more energy to do so, I will help you with it.

103
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.490
Just come out of this body.

104
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.880
Why? You don't like this body?

105
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.240
I like it. I also have an interest in Alice's body.

106
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.560
Well, I could have dated her casually.

107
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.030
However, I have never had a scandal.

108
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.940
Are you scared your popularity with other women will drop?

109
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:03.080
No. I'm angry because you ruined a very precious opportunity.

110
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.150
An opportunity?

111
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:10.690
There's a girl whom I cherish as a little sister. There's a reason she needs to become very famous.

112
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.140
But you ruined her opportunity.

113
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.580
A girl you cherish?

114
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.590
The Zombie? Were you going to make a scandal with the Zombie?

115
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.600
Anyhow, I need to take care of your matter first.

116
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.540
Pick out a man.

117
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.060
I will find a much better man than that pig and obsess that man's body.

118
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.340
They'll be out soon.

119
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.220
I don't want to do this.

120
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.990
I think it would be good for our Oh Gong to stay out of it this time.

121
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.260
You have to be by my side.

122
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.160
Oh, they're coming out.

123
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.400
I'm here to pick them up in place of Han Byeol's father.

124
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.080
Yes, I was notified.

125
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.370
Hello, kids.

126
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.250
I heard Uncle Jonathan would come.

127
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.940
I'm going.

128
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.630
Oh, Ahjusshi Jonathan was supposed to come,

129
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.830
- but something came up, so Auntie Real Estate came instead.
- Yes.

130
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.410
This is uncle Oh Gong.

131
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.720
Who said I'm an uncle? I don't want to be called an uncle.

132
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.760
Don't call me uncle.

133
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.890
- Yes.
- Yes.

134
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.980
Noona, then what should I call him?

135
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.200
Secretary Son.

136
00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:06.110
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by
The Monkey Minions @ Viki</i>

137
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:12.150
Take care of the kids for an hour. I have to go to the bank.

138
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.500
Then can I temporarily seal the kids' lips for an hour?

139
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.370
- I dare you to.
- You will regret this.

140
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:23.390
It's possible that your company's only employee might resent you and quit.

141
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.980
Then I will be really sad.

142
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.610
Just one hour.

143
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.540
I'll be back soon.

144
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.350
I'll watch over you kids.

145
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.060
Don't ask me for anything.

146
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.660
I know that it's a bothersome task to watch someone else's kids.

147
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.600
We won't ask you for anything, Secretary Son.

148
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.730
Hey, what are you drawing?

149
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.510
Is that a cucumber?

150
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.950
It's a dinosaur.

151
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.790
How is that a dinosaur? It looks like a cucumber.

152
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.390
It's a herbivore dinosaur.

153
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.740
A brontosaurus.

154
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.810
It must be a cucumber that the herbivore brontosaurus is eating.

155
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.110
Let's redraw it.

156
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.430
What are you doing to draw again?

157
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.900
Please don't concern yourself about it, Secretary Son.

158
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.670
Is it a dinosaur again? Geez.

159
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.950
What kind of dinosaur is that?

160
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.560
A brontosaurus.

161
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.980
Again? Hey, the brontosaurus is the only dinosaur you know, right?

162
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.300
You don't know any others.

163
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.280
If you know any others, then tell me. Tell me, tell me!

164
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.520
Hey, little kid next to her.

165
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.970
The only dinosaur your Noona knows is this long cucumber like brontosaurus.

166
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.030
Right? Did they only teach you this one thing at your preschool?

167
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.320
You didn't study properly, huh?

168
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.660
Why are you crying?

169
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.490
Stop it. Don't cry.

170
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.520
I got it. I got it. I will show you a dinosaur. A dinosaur.

171
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.830
If I show you a dinosaur, you can't cry.

172
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.080
- Okay, look here.
- Wow!

173
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.960
Is that good?

174
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.350
They must be kids from the same preschool.

175
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.050
Let's go.

176
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.220
Where did they go?

177
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.140
Oh? What brings you to my house?

178
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:55.390
Hyungnim asked me to come and make some snacks for the kids.

179
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.370
Is that so?

180
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.140
Since I'm here, would it be alright to clean the refrigerator also?

181
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.820
I don't think I'll be able to sleep at night if I just left it.

182
00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.610
- Okay.
- Thank you.

183
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.880
The Chairman of a company that manufactures refrigerators

184
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.520
Is cleaning my refrigerator?

185
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.080
Oh, Jeo Pal Gye.

186
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.700
I'm here as PK today.

187
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.140
Hyungnim Oh Gong asked me to sign autographs and sing a song for the kids.

188
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.870
I have to get to my Singapore concert, but I'm late.

189
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.670
I'm going then.

190
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.150
PK came to my house to sing a song?

191
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.280
- Bu Ja, you came as well.
- Yes.

192
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.740
Son Oh Gong asked me to come and draw with the kids.

193
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.480
Thank you.

194
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.420
But where is that punk?

195
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.370
I can't handle kids.

196
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.350
Why did they suddenly cry? They startled this Monkey.

197
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.170
We don't get along.

198
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.750
I am going to do somersault at home.

199
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.750
Han Byeol, we should go home.

200
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.490
I don't want to go. I'm not going home.

201
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.490
I don't want to go either.

202
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.500
We saw a brontosaurus,

203
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.260
and we saw the Chairman and PK also!

204
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.810
You were only watching TV all day long, huh?

205
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:54.630
I didn't see them on TV, they were real. We also saw an Unnie whose eyes pop out.

206
00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:01.970
Kids, you should hurry home. Your mom must be waiting.

207
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.740
We're not going.

208
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.560
We're not going.

209
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.340
Uh oh, our Han Byeol needs to stop being stubborn and go home.

210
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.380
This real estate Auntie is really scary.

211
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.270
You're going to get in trouble. That's enough.

212
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:18.020
I want to marry Secretary Son and live here.

213
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:23.350
Han Byeol, you're supposed to marry your soulmate.

214
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.470
I want to do that.

215
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.180
No, you definitely can't do that.

216
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.170
Someone else is your soulmate.

217
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:35.560
You can't marry him. Never.

218
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.620
But why are you so scarily opposing marriage to a child?

219
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.610
I'm also against this marriage as her father.

220
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:48.610
Let's go, Han Byeol. Come here.

221
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.470
Let's go.

222
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.950
<i>You can marry me again. No matter how many times you become my bride, I'll always accept you.</i>

223
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:15.130
Soulmate. Could it be for real?

224
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.090
One of the death bells has disappeared.

225
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.560
I heard that the grandson of the peddler lost it.

226
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.110
By death bell, are you talking about the unlucky black bell?

227
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:31.980
Right. It lets you tell who is the worst fate for you in your life.

228
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.500
It would be dangerous if it fell into the hands of a human.

229
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:42.990
If we found it, we may get some points for it.

230
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.350
So you're going to ask Sam Jang to find those kinds of missing items as well?

231
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:58.320
Me? For something so trivial, I'll ask Secretary Ma to find it.

232
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.180
Don't make Sam Jang touch that unlucky thing.

233
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.270
I got it. Gosh.

234
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.610
Oppa, I'm hungry.

235
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.430
<i>911 emergency rescue team. An emergency!</i>

236
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.470
Be quiet!

237
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.920
<i>An urgent patient.</i>

238
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.680
I told you not to be noisy!

239
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.120
Run away to the room.

240
00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.860
I told you not to be noisy!

241
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.800
Father, I was wrong.

242
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.440
You won't listen to me?

243
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.490
- <i>I told you to be quiet.
- Oppa. Oppa.</i>

244
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.110
Oppa.

245
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.210
Oppa. Oppa.

246
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.770
Oppa.

247
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:36.340
<i>A fierce tiger chased after a girl and her brother.</i>

248
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.830
<i>Both kids prayed for help.</i>

249
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.450
<i>At that moment,</i>

250
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.370
<i>a golden rope came down from the heavens.</i>

251
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.980
It's a rope.

252
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:10.710
<i>Two kids hold the rope and went up to the heaven.</i>

253
00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:21.245
Soo Jeong!

254
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.690
Lee Soo Jeong!

255
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.880
Soo Jeong!

256
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.950
Lee Soo Jeong!

257
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.780
Lee Soo Jeong!

258
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.130
<i>[The Sun and Moon]</i>

259
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.230
Grin reapers say that the souls of kids are often disappearing recently.

260
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:14.540
I guess there must be an evil spirit that steals children's souls.

261
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:21.940
I thought so, too, and so I wanted to ask you to take care of it but... will you be all right with that?

262
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.620
Why wouldn't I be?

263
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.900
By any chance that you're worried that evil spirit might be Na Chal Nyeo, would you?

264
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:40.340
Na Chal Nyeo was also an evil spirit that ate up the souls of children, wasn't she?

265
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.780
She was already caught and is being punished for it, is she not?

266
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.660
I know that, of course. Fortunately, it's not Na Chal Nyeo.

267
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:55.550
But I'm simply concerned that this might unnecessarily remind you of that accident.

268
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:04.880
If you're that concerned about it, then when I catch the evil spirit,

269
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.800
be sure to give me a lot of points for it.

270
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.570
Bringing up Na Chal Nyeo really fires him up. Give me some more tea.

271
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.860
There is none left. I don't wish to give you any. Please leave.

272
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.890
What a faithful dog.

273
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:37.410
Even that infamous dog Patrasche (from Dog of Flanders) probably wasn't as loyal as her.

274
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:57.030
Jung Se Ra is still alive, lost her memory of the accident, and is currently living as a trainee for Lucifer Entertainment?

275
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.480
I'm sorry we didn't tell you earlier that she disappeared.

276
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.650
That's okay.

277
00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:07.030
I'm sure you both must have been surprised when her body went missing.

278
00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:12.030
In any case, what happened on that day was just mistaken then, wasn't it?

279
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:17.080
You've both worked hard. There won't be any reason for us to see each other in the future.

280
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.980
It's a relief.

281
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:32.450
He didn't ask us to give him back our payment. He is different because he's highly educated.

282
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:38.660
Something doesn't feel right. Let's hide first.

283
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.630
Make it so that I won't be able to see those two anymore.

284
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.870
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

285
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.870
She's totally safe and sound.

286
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.950
But she was dead for sure.

287
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.700
- Did I mistake her as dead because I had been drinking?
- What are you going to do about that girl?

288
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.190
I'm going to need to get another proper look at her.

289
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.650
Do you think that is your bed?

290
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:33.470
Why are you always coming in here and lying there?

291
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.960
This is much more comfortable than the veranda.

292
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.170
This bathtub wasn't made for you to relax here. Get out of there already.

293
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.390
I don't want to.

294
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:47.380
You don't want to?

295
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:53.650
Sure, stay right there. I'll just pour some hot water in for you.

296
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:59.350
Because you are mean like this, Sam Jang doesn't like you.

297
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.900
Who said she doesn't like me?

298
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.940
- I just know it.
- What would a zombie know?

299
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:13.750
I woke up with her blood. Elder Soo Boo Ri said I am connected to her.

300
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.020
Really?

301
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.480
So you just know how she feels?

302
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.450
Probably. Since we are connected.

303
00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:29.550
Come here. Look at me straight.

304
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.710
When you look at me, what comes to your mind?

305
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:45.060
Son Oh Gong. You look handsome.

306
00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:50.460
I know, but I don't want to know your opinion, but what Sam Jang thinks.

307
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.500
You... have no clue, do you?

308
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.500
- I'm sorry.
- That's fine. It can happen.

309
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.650
Sit there. Just stay there.

310
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:17.020
Which side was the hot water? I'm going to cook you up real good.

311
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.330
She likes you.

312
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.540
She likes you, Son Oh Gong.

313
00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.020
I can tell just by looking at her.

314
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.330
Are you tricking me just because you don't want to be cooked?

315
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.300
If I turned into a steamed zombie, Unnie will be sad.

316
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.050
If Unnie's sad, then doesn't that make you sad as well?

317
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:48.450
You two are connected as well.

318
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.610
Even a zombie can learn how to brown-nose as it ages.

319
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.680
You're saved from being a steamed zombie.

320
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.910
Kindly turn off the lights when you leave.

321

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

322
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.120
Take a shower on the second floor. The zombie is sleeping in the bathtub in lower bathroom.

323
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.550
I poured so much into that Energy Bathtub but it's turning into a coffin for a zombie.

324
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.880
Why on earth did you bring such a zombie when you can't handler her properly?

325
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.950
I clearly told you that you could burn her.

326
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.130
But you're the one that keeps raising her in that refrigerator!

327
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.790
How am I supposed to be able to burn a kid after I've started taking care of her?

328
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.600
You have neither a sense of responsibility nor compassion. Such a thug.

329
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.140
Why are you insulting me while acting like you're such a nice guy? If she's that much of a bother then you can just abandon her.

330
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.510
Unlike you, I don't abandon things just because they're a bother.

331
00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:03.450
Oh, is that so? Then tell me again how a guy with such a strong sense of responsibility left Na Chal Nyeo to end up like that?

332
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:26.060
Ma Wang, I'll take the zombie out to play on the veranda. Take a bath.

333
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.960
Forget it.

334
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.850
I shouldn't have brought up Na Chal Nyeo.

335
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:40.360
Ma Wang, the most valuable liquor in my entire Sureumdong collection

336
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.170
...isn't this one, but it's still pretty valuable.

337
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:53.620
Because we were needlessly fighting over that zombie, Na Chal Nyeo came up.

338
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:59.170
Since it's come to this, should I just throw the zombie out?

339
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.050
Don't bother. Don't blame Bu Ja for this.

340
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.490
If you're that sorry, then work hard to get me points

341
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:12.660
so that I can quickly become a deity.

342
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.950
Right. You need to quickly become a deity so you can save Na Chal Nyeo.

343
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.290
She wasn't just Na Chal Nyeo, she used to be a deity.

344
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.200
I was the one that turned her into the monster Na Chal Nyeo.

345
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.450
Because she met me, her fate changed.

346
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.650
Yeah. Why would a deity date you anyway? Such bad luck.

347
00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:44.010
There should be another woman with just as much bad luck as her though.

348
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:52.410
There's Sam Jang, whose fate changed after meeting you, isn't there? The reason human Jin Seon Mi became Sam Jang is your fault, no?

349
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.990
And so because of that I've got Geumganggo on me and am protecting her by her side, am I not?

350
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:04.260
Sam Jang said her wish was to become a normal person. She had to put a Geumgganggo on you and catch evil spirits with you.

351
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.680
Instead of becoming Sam Jang who can summon Son Oh Gong,

352
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.760
she wants to become a normal human who can get married and have kids.

353
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:17.450
But you made it impossible for her to ever be able to live like that by turning her into Sam Jang.

354
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.870
So, you don't need to laugh at me.

355
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.620
You, too, are a very bad guy. Reflect on it.

356
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:33.210
Geez, you can't even soothe yourself with alcohol since you are not allowed to drink.

357
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.520
Right?

358
00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.200
A normal Jin Seon Mi?

359
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.790
Thank you for looking after my kids.

360
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.670
This is a meal certificate for a snack-bar.

361
00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:01.690
I didn't buy it. I won it as a prize. I heard the foods are yummy there. Please help yourself.

362
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.390
No, thank you. Please take it to treat yourself and your family.

363
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:08.470
It's more hard work if we eat out.

364
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.970
On top of that, my kids only eat what I cook for tteokbokki (spicy rice cake).

365
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.960
I feel jealous.

366
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.430
Of my tteokbokki?

367
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:22.310
I envy people who enjoy normal family lives like you the most.

368
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.210
That's nothing.

369
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:29.270
You can also date someone and marry a guy after that. Why can you do that?

370
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:33.470
Living like that is very difficult for me.

371
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:39.790
Why can it be so hard? Why don't you ask a guy out to eat tteokbokki with you?

372
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:41.470
Should I try it? I am nervous about it.

373
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.520
I will call him and ask him. Where is my phone?

374
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.800
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

375
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.480
Ah,

376
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.910
you don't need a phone to call him.

377
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.590
When did you come?

378
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.380
You cook tteokbokki for your kids?

379
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.940
Where were you calling before?

380
00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.420
Nothing.

381
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.350
By any chance, you were calling someone else? It must be me, right?

382
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.710
You came?

383
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:25.530
Yeah. Just as he was about to call me to have tteokbokki with you, I came on time.

384
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.260
Then, will you go with me to eat tteokbokki?

385
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.470
Sure.

386
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.750
Okay. I'll get my coat and be right back.

387
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.050
Right. Right. I was about to call Jonathan.

388
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.740
I was. I was. What are you going to do?

389
00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.260
Just because of that, you can't eyeball me like that?

390
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.960
What is there to be envious about?

391
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.990
- What?
- She just said she was envious that you could live an ordinary life.

392
00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.950
Are you envious of my ordinary life as well?

393
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.590
No way. Not at all. Never.

394
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.580
Then you should let her go.

395
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:12.220
You can't make her happy, ever.

396
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.350
My tummy.

397
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.900
tteokbokki looks spicy. I should have ordered a mild one.

398
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.130
They said this one is the yummiest.

399
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.480
Let's try it first.

400
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:48.130
It feels weird that we're talking about tteokbokki instead of an evil spirit.

401
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:53.100
Isn't this what you wished to do? This is an ordinary thing to do.

402
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.510
You're right. I like it.

403
00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:02.320
- You like this kind of things?
- Yes.

404
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.370
Then let's keep going like this.

405
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.790
It looks too spicy for me. Go and order me a mild one.

406
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:13.160
You brought this, saying this looked the yummiest.

407
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.440
I can exchange this for that mild one over there. But I won't do it because we're acting in an ordinary way.

408
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.910
You eat this up and bring me a new one.

409
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.960
Okay.

410
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.600
- Is it tasty?
- It is spicy.

411
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.030
Where are we going?

412
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.810
We don't have any destination. We are just taking a walk like others.

413
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:50.090
- So we just keep going like this?
- Exactly.

414
00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:54.160
No, wait this is not normal.

415
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.820
Everyone walks like this. You should also not look in front, but on your phone.

416
00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:03.210
♪ <i>I couldn't feel right just because of your few words</i> ♪

417
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:10.770
♪ <i>I can't stop laughing even with your few words</i> ♪

418
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:14.260
Everyone walks like this.

419
00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.990
What are you looking at me for? You should look at your phone like a normal person.

420
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:23.170
♪ <i>You became the world to me</i> ♪

421
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:30.300
♪ <i>Now you make my hand rest</i> ♪

422
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.390
♪ <i>I will always be next to you</i> ♪

423
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:41.240
So, we ate together, took a stroll and I took you home.

424
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.170
Thank you.

425
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:48.070
In this situation, you need to make a decision. What situation are we in among the normal ones?

426
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:55.340
A friend would come in, play and leave. A family member would come in, eat and leave. A boyfriend would come in, sleep and leave.

427
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.920
Don't dare flirt with me.

428
00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:03.250
Yes, I am flirting with you. But I got to be curious as I do it.

429
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.290
About what?

430
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:10.060
If we forget about our owner and slave thing with Geumganggo situation, what are we?

431
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:15.060
If you're not Sam Jang, you have no reason to call me, the Great Sage.

432
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:22.790
If your special ability disappears, I will be gone from your side. Will that be really okay with you?

433
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.930
Even if so, do you really want (to be a normal person)?

434
00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.970
I'm leaving.

435
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:05.520
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by

437
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.700
<i>Will that be really okay with you?</i>

438
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.000
<i>Will she be really okay with me?</i>

439
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.990
Can I ask you something?

440
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:46.890
It must be impossible for a human to have a demon as her soulmate, right?

441
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.690
- It makes no sense, right?
- Yes, it makes no sense.

442
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.930
- Couldn't there be at least one case?
- No.

443
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:59.050
I've never seen a human marry a demon and live happily ever after.

444
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:03.230
I heard that a human found a demon as her soulmate, though.

445
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:12.770
They are fated by Grandma Sam Sin (Godness who control birth and family).
Thats what I heard.

446
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.820
Where did you hear it?

447
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:22.580
I heard it from the grandson of the peddler. What did he call it, Love Bell?

448
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.630
It rang, he said.

449
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:33.130
Is that so? I guess Grandma Sam Sin made a mistake.

450
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:39.960
Even so, it can be a fate if it was decided to be that way, right?

451
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.420
There won't be a change, right?

452
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.710
Such fates can't be changed.

453
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:50.280
A fate or deadly-fate. Nothing can't be changed.

454
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.660
That's right. What a relief.

455
00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.910
I am hungry.

456
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:31.570
<i>A starved boy was so surprised to find a food in front of him.</i>

457
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.440
It's a biscuit.

458
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:48.000
<i>Kids followed the way the biscuits led.</i>

459
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:53.870
Then, they found a house made of all sort of sweets before them.

460
00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:02.620
Kids entered the house and

461
00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.890
live happily without ever being starved again.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.420
<i>Another child?</i>

467

468
00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.120
<i>That's what I am saying.</i>

469
00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.530

470

472
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.950
<i>What did it happen?</i>

473
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:31.660
<i>I heard that he's dead. I don't know why.</i>

That child I brought last time had escaped from the book.

476
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.830
Did he miss his dad? Is that why he escape?

477
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:48.360
I'll catch the evil spirit that's stealing childrens' souls.

478
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:54.110
I don't need any points, but just tell me one thing.

479
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.700
Is it about Na Chal Nyeo?

480
00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:02.990
Just please let me know where and how she's living in this life time.

481
00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.290
Even if you knew, Ma Wang, you still wouldn't be able to meddle into her life.

482
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:12.890
I know very well that I can't get involved. Of course.

483
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:19.680
So could you please at least just tell me whether or not she's been born again?

484
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.690
If you want to know about the life or death of a human, then quickly

485
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.510
become a deity.

486
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.810
This is tasty.

487
00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.440
Please leave.

488
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.390
Such a faithful dog.

489
00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.970
After moving my store location, you're my first customer.

490
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.860
Feel free to come have some.

491
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.040
I heard there's been an evil spirit capturing children's souls these days.

492
00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:34.560
She could be in danger. I need to report it to the Great Sage.

493
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.180
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

494
00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.030
Why? It's faster if we go through here.

495
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:47.070
This path is super scary. Let's through somewhere else. I'm going first.

496
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.470
We'll be late though.

497
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:58.730
This is where the wandering souls have gathered.

498
00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:03.010
I've heard that children's souls have been disappearing from here lately too.

499
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.930
Let's go in.

500
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:19.340
Looks like all the wanderers in the neighborhood are here.

501
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.790
This is the child.

502
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.010
Child, do you perhaps know who the person that caught you is?

503
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.160
She's not speaking.

504
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.870
Hey! Do you like dinosaurs?

505
00:49:56.870 --> 00:50:00.200
Do you want to see a Brontosaurus?

506
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.420
Your friend from the preschool grabbed a rope and left?

507
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.650
Yeah, my friend said so.

508
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:19.650
Just like in the fairy tale The Sun and Moon,

509
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:23.790
a rope fell from the sky and his sister grabbed hold of it and left.

510
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:32.630
There was an incident with one of the kids in our apartment complex. They fell off the veranda.

511
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.100
But that girl's older brother said he saw the whole situation.

512
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:41.150
He's young so I guessed he believed that something actually came out of a fairy tale book or something.

513
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.620
A fairy tale book?

517
00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.190
He's trying to find it along with the Winter General. Thanks to your work, Sam Jang -

518
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:05.240
It seems Son Oh Gong is racking up points for me on his own accord.

519
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.790
I'm very sorry about that.

520
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.050
But why did you call for me?

521
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:18.170
There's a lost item that I would like it if you could find for me. It's an extremely dangerous item, you see.

522
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:19.600
You're making me do all sorts of thing.

523
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.490
After all, I do need to stack my points. Lots and lots! Quickly!

524
00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:29.790
I didn't put the Geumganggo on Son Oh Gong just to rack up points for you though, Ma Wang.

525
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:35.670
Yes, I know. You put it on him so he wouldn't prey on you, of course.

526
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:38.370
Which is why I wanted to ask you this.

527
00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:43.300
How about releasing Oh Gong from the Geumganggo?

528
00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.540
- Excuse me?
- It's because I feel like there could be another fate

529
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:52.160
between us other than Geumganggo binding us as master and servant.

530
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.270
Just as you saw in the jar of ill omens,

531
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.800
the only thing binding you two is an unfortunate fate though Geumganggo.

532
00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.180
There's also a possibility of a better fate for us.

533
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.930
That's definitely not possible. You two have an ill-fated connection.

534
00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:03.230
How can you be so sure?

535
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:08.090
Because the one who changed your fate was Son Oh Gong.

536
00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.680
You became Sam Jang as punishment for releasing him.

537
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.700
How could it be?

538

<i>You're going to be punished for letting this bad guy free. Most likely.</i>

540
00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.380
<i>- What kind of punishment?
- Don't be too scared.</i>

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.070
<i>I wish for you to survive well.</i>

542
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:31.460
<i>I must get going</i>

543
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.250
You became Sam Jang because of Son Oh Gong.

544
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:41.000
He knows this the best. So if you don't believe me

545
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.860
you can call him and make sure of it yourself.

546
00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.970
Is it true?

547
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.770
Is that the truth, Son Oh Gong?

548
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.220
Was it true?

549
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.970
Yeah.

550
00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:23.080
The reason that you're living such a 'special' life

551
00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.180
Is because of me.

I see.

553
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:35.740
I guess me meeting you, really was just a huge calamity after all.

I even gave you your name, didn't I? I have been feeding you energy beads too.

No, not a minion. Rather...

be my brother. A sibling.

573
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:25.030
Will you be alright to have a zombie sibling?

574
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:28.490
Hey, my bro. Your brother'll be right back

575
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:34.440
after my recording session so eat these and then go look around the broadcasting station.

576
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.140
If you go home after getting really lively from eating the energy beads

577
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.300
Ma Wang might get suspicious so...

578
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.690
Let's go and have fun! Do you have any place you want to go to?

619
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:05.920
I can recognize the souls of unhappy children with just one glance.

620
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:11.160
All of those children were desperately praying that I take them away.

621
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.160
All of the kids called me.

622
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.360
Don't lie. Who called you?

623
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.190
You know the answer, Seon Mi.

624
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.100
You used to call me, too.

625
01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:31.840
I could recognize your extremely unhappy younger self at a single glance.

626
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:45.080
Just how much that child was lonely and unhappy,

627
01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.580
you should know it well.

628
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:52.110
Shall I take that child away for you?

629
01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:58.060
As long as that child is gone, then you won't have to struggle anymore.

630
01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:06.780
I'll take away that child with such a special ability that made you unhappy.

631
01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:14.940
<i>Jin Seon Mi</i>

632
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.690
<i>This belongs to a ghost.</i>

633
01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:43.130
Can you really... take her away?

634
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:50.050
Of course. I came and chose a really fun fairy tale book.

635
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.740
Shall I read the book that's just for you?

636
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:31.710
Goodbye.

637
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.090
Excuse me. Excuse me, wake up! Hey!

638
01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.270
Huh?

639
01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:58.190
What's going on?

640
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:06.300
What is it?

641
01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:13.770
I can't feel the Sam Jang's blood drop which has been wondering through my body.

642
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:21.460
Sam Jang... has disappeared.

643
01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.440
<i>Son Oh Gong.</i>

644
01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:36.270
Something is off.

645
01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:40.020
What is wrong?

646
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.970
Someone called for me.

647
01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:47.190
Sam Jang.

648
01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.600
Something's extremely off.

649
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.150
You came.

650
01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:03.320
What are you? Where is Sam Jang?

651
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.410
It's Sam Jang.

652
01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:24.210
This woman is no longer Sam Jang.

653
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.090
Where is the one who called me?

654
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.400
I called you.

655
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.160
What? What are you supposed to be?

656
01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:42.360
I'm the new owner of the Geumganggo.

657
