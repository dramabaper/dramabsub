(Viewer discretion is advised.)

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.309 line:93%
I'll give you one last chance.

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:13.508 line:93%
Don't let me go.

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.198 line:93%
Then it's over.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.528 line:93%
Goodbye.

00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:52.918 line:93%
Why are you so hard to get?

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.159 line:93%
Let's go.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.538 line:93%
(Episode 38)

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.018 line:93%
You should go in first.

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:10.499 line:93%
The directors don't see the merit of investing.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:14.228 line:93%
I'm sorry. You failed the evaluation.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.508 line:93%
"I don't understand why Do Kyung left home..."

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.969 line:93%
"even though there's nothing between us."

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.739 line:93%
"So stop yelling at me,"

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.309 line:93%
"and settle it with your son."

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:30.048 line:93%
"I especially have no intention..."

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:31.348 line:93%
"of joining your family ever again."

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:39.189 line:93%
It's not that I'm afraid.

00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:41.358 line:93%
I just don't like it.

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:43.059 line:93%
This is my decision.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.399 line:93%
My decision for my own life.

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:51.899 line:93%
There's...

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:54.809 line:93%
another world that I can't see.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.209 line:93%
It is...

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.848 line:93%
different from my world.

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:05.918 line:93%
I can't...

00:03:06.888 --> 00:03:08.989 line:93%
be happy in that world.

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:26.508 line:93%
I...

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:29.839 line:93%
just started to be happy only now.

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.378 line:93%
I just started to learn what it is like...

00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:36.519 line:93%
to live at ease. Here. Now.

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:11.448 line:93%
Do Kyung.

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:13.318 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:14.719 line:93%
Are you okay?

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.759 line:93%
You look ill.

00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:19.358 line:93%
Where does it hurt?

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.988 line:93%
No. I'm fine.

00:04:21.988 --> 00:04:23.928 line:93%
Here. I'll help you get up.

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.928 line:93%
If... If you need any medicine,

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:01.769 line:93%
it's in front of your door.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.069 line:93%
Does he not need it?

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.029 line:93%
Do... Do Kyung.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.098 line:93%
Do Kyung.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.428 line:93%
Do Kyung.

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:10.238 line:93%
- Do... - Cold... It's cold.

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:30.719 line:93%
Gosh, it's cold.

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.519 line:93%
Are you okay?

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:34.188 line:93%
Take some medicine.

00:06:35.358 --> 00:06:37.928 line:93%
Take some medicine. Get up.

00:06:42.428 --> 00:06:43.598 line:93%
Drink some water.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.738 line:93%
Who are you?

00:06:45.998 --> 00:06:47.308 line:93%
I'm Ji An.

00:06:48.868 --> 00:06:50.079 line:93%
It's you, Ji An.

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:51.409 line:93%
Yes.

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:55.149 line:93%
Ji An, who never listens to me...

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.569 line:93%
Come on. Lie down now.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:29.579 line:93%
Seo Ji An.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.918 line:93%
Seo Ji An, who never listens to me...

00:07:35.748 --> 00:07:36.788 line:93%
because she is...

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:40.928 line:93%
too stubborn.

00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:45.228 line:93%
You won't be able to handle me.

00:07:47.928 --> 00:07:49.129 line:93%
I can't keep doing this.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.238 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:56.209 line:93%
I love her,

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.178 line:93%
but we can't be together...

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:10.159 line:93%
even in my dreams now.

00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:34.708 line:93%
It must've been...

00:08:38.178 --> 00:08:39.749 line:93%
quite an ordeal for you.

00:08:42.948 --> 00:08:44.218 line:93%
Do Kyung.

00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:47.688 line:93%
Goodbye.

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:54.489 line:93%
Why are you cooking porridge?

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:57.058 line:93%
I think my stomach is upset.

00:09:57.428 --> 00:09:58.798 line:93%
I cooked this a while ago too.

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:01.798 line:93%
Did you see your family? Is there nothing wrong?

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:03.869 line:93%
I did.

00:10:05.499 --> 00:10:07.239 line:93%
Did you have a fight with Mr. Choi?

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:11.808 line:93%
He will...

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.678 line:93%
go back home now.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:42.909 line:93%
Hey, Hyuk. Let's go.

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:05.259 line:93%
Do Kyung is going to come back home now.

00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:08.668 line:93%
Dad stopped all investments Do Kyung got.

00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:10.538 line:93%
He stopped the investments?

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:14.208 line:93%
It seems like he got investments for White Bio.

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:17.879 line:93%
Did he stop the investments already?

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.548 line:93%
Seo Ji An is the problem.

00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:23.119 line:93%
So far, she seems to know her place...

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:25.448 line:93%
and is behaving accordingly,

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:27.448 line:93%
but I can't trust her.

00:11:28.849 --> 00:11:31.259 line:93%
Do Kyung will give up and come back anyway.

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:39.629 line:93%
He's trying to start this entirely on his own.

00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:42.298 line:93%
Can't Father give him a chance to do so?

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:45.798 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:48.739 line:93%
For the first time in his life,

00:11:48.739 --> 00:11:50.739 line:93%
he can achieve something without Haesung.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:54.479 line:93%
And there are other ways to bring him back home.

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:12.899 line:93%
- Hi. Have some porridge. - Hello.

00:12:13.769 --> 00:12:15.129 line:93%
What? Do you know how to cook porridge?

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.599 line:93%
I didn't cook this.

00:12:17.968 --> 00:12:19.239 line:93%
Was it Carpenter Yang?

00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:23.109 line:93%
Anything on the table means it's for everyone.

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:25.308 line:93%
- Okay. - Bye.

00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:34.119 line:93%
My stomach was empty. How nice.

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:44.298 line:93%
Yes, Secretary Yoo.

00:12:44.859 --> 00:12:47.568 line:93%
Why are you using your phone again, sir?

00:12:48.198 --> 00:12:51.298 line:93%
Your secret phone was off, so I called this number.

00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:53.639 line:93%
It just happened that way.

00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:57.379 line:93%
My part-time job?

00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.639 line:93%
Yes, I have to work.

00:13:01.578 --> 00:13:03.649 line:93%
Yes, Okay. I'll see you later.

00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:06.519 line:93%
Weren't you getting investments?

00:13:06.718 --> 00:13:08.249 line:93%
Why are you working on a part-time job again?

00:13:08.489 --> 00:13:10.019 line:93%
All of my investments were cut off.

00:13:10.588 --> 00:13:12.619 line:93%
Grandfather influenced every part of my project.

00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:13.759 line:93%
Already?

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:17.828 line:93%
Do Kyung, this is serious. You must go back.

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:19.129 line:93%
He's too fast.

00:13:20.328 --> 00:13:21.369 line:93%
I'm not sure.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:25.168 line:93%
Or use the money under your name.

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:33.649 line:93%
I will never use that money.

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:35.448 line:93%
(Application for reissue)

00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:37.349 line:93%
So you tried to get your bankbook reissued.

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:40.849 line:93%
When he kicked me out penniless,

00:13:41.418 --> 00:13:43.058 line:93%
I wondered if he was testing me.

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:44.659 line:93%
But he wasn't.

00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:46.828 line:93%
He was trying make me...

00:13:47.588 --> 00:13:50.129 line:93%
be his helper and become even more loyal to him.

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:52.159 line:93%
So what?

00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:55.428 line:93%
I want to try harder after realizing his intentions.

00:13:56.798 --> 00:13:58.838 line:93%
Living a life as a piece on his chessboard?

00:13:59.808 --> 00:14:00.838 line:93%
I won't do it.

00:14:01.109 --> 00:14:03.109 line:93%
Then will you keep working part-time jobs?

00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:05.609 line:93%
I need money to get by.

00:14:07.048 --> 00:14:09.609 line:93%
I have 60 dollars left after the interpreter job.

00:14:09.918 --> 00:14:13.048 line:93%
Without investments, your project is nothing.

00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:15.019 line:93%
What do you plan to do with that?

00:14:16.688 --> 00:14:18.318 line:93%
I must figure it out again.

00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:20.129 line:93%
But I need to make a living first.

00:14:21.489 --> 00:14:23.558 line:93%
How did it go with Ji An?

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:25.229 line:93%
Seo Ji An?

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.798 line:93%
I hate her.

00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:28.129 line:93%
What?

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:29.529 line:93%
I'll try to hate her.

00:14:30.968 --> 00:14:33.109 line:93%
You left home because of love, but...

00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:36.708 line:93%
it didn't work out, and your business plan failed.

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:39.879 line:93%
I can't wait to find out what happens next.

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:43.578 line:93%
Same here. I don't know what lies ahead for me.

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:46.389 line:93%
Come up with a small business plan first.

00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:49.088 line:93%
I knew the project was too big to be your first.

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.328 line:93%
Secretary Yoo.

00:14:57.499 --> 00:14:59.659 line:93%
Why are you wearing that? Aren't you going to work?

00:15:00.068 --> 00:15:02.298 line:93%
I resigned.

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:05.668 line:93%
You resigned? Why did you do that?

00:15:06.869 --> 00:15:09.109 line:93%
I told you to stay at Haesung.

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:10.338 line:93%
Well...

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:14.078 line:93%
Actually, I was transferred...

00:15:14.078 --> 00:15:16.048 line:93%
to the Administration Team in the Busan branch.

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:17.519 line:93%
The Busan branch?

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:20.349 line:93%
- Not the main branch? - No, sir.

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.818 line:93%
I already bought an apartment in Seoul.

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:26.688 line:93%
I couldn't take my mother to Busan.

00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:29.088 line:93%
Besides, I know nothing about administration.

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:33.798 line:93%
They were trying to separate you from me.

00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:36.698 line:93%
I'm really sorry.

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:40.338 line:93%
So I resigned a long time ago.

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:44.078 line:93%
I was waiting for you while working other jobs.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.448 line:93%
They found out everything. What will you do now?

00:15:48.409 --> 00:15:50.418 line:93%
I should think about it while I work.

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:53.288 line:93%
I completely ran out of money.

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:56.918 line:93%
Well, then...

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.688 line:93%
would you want to work with me?

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:09.168 line:93%
My goodness.

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.499 line:93%
Even snowmen will freeze to death in here.

00:16:12.198 --> 00:16:14.208 line:93%
People get frostbite even in summers,

00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:16.139 line:93%
but the pay is quite generous.

00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:17.509 line:93%
When I was in college,

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:20.048 line:93%
I used to work here while living in the dorm.

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:24.619 line:93%
It's freezing in here, but look at me sweating.

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:26.649 line:93%
What an irony.

00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:29.318 line:93%
Save your energy.

00:16:29.448 --> 00:16:31.958 line:93%
We have to carry the bags of crushed ice later.

00:16:32.188 --> 00:16:34.259 line:93%
Your body might melt away.

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:43.938 line:93%
What brings you to my office, Jin Hee?

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:46.609 line:93%
I'm not here as your sister-in-law, sir.

00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:49.168 line:93%
I'm here as the president of Hotel MJ.

00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:51.178 line:93%
Then what business do you bring?

00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:52.479 line:93%
It's about Do Kyung.

00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:56.109 line:93%
Until when do we have to wait for Do Kyung?

00:16:57.578 --> 00:16:59.989 line:93%
He's been away for too long.

00:17:00.489 --> 00:17:01.688 line:93%
He's been assigned to the Europe office...

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.659 line:93%
as Chief Director.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.688 line:93%
The position shouldn't be left empty for long.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.528 line:93%
Hasn't it been only 20 days?

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:12.528 line:93%
Then cancel the appointment.

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:16.569 line:93%
That's within your prerogative, isn't it?

00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:22.909 line:93%
Do you have to ask the chairman?

00:17:23.379 --> 00:17:26.208 line:93%
Then please ask him, and let me know.

00:17:39.389 --> 00:17:41.289 line:93%
I rented an apartment,

00:17:41.329 --> 00:17:43.528 line:93%
and I already got it furnished.

00:17:44.258 --> 00:17:46.228 line:93%
Then you should hurry and get a ticket.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.998 line:93%
But we haven't gotten a bodyguard for her.

00:17:49.129 --> 00:17:51.698 line:93%
We can't let her go alone.

00:17:51.938 --> 00:17:53.208 line:93%
Why couldn't you find one?

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.708 line:93%
Then pay double.

00:17:55.768 --> 00:17:58.678 line:93%
Paying more won't make any difference.

00:17:59.238 --> 00:18:01.549 line:93%
He would have to watch her all day and every day.

00:18:02.109 --> 00:18:05.018 line:93%
Besides, it's hard to find a Korean there.

00:18:08.018 --> 00:18:10.789 line:93%
You want a raise, don't you?

00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:12.319 line:93%
Pardon me?

00:18:12.319 --> 00:18:13.728 line:93%
Why can't you find someone...

00:18:13.728 --> 00:18:15.258 line:93%
when you pay a lot?

00:18:15.758 --> 00:18:18.228 line:93%
Isn't that why you're complaining?

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:24.599 line:93%
Offer to pay triple, and quickly find someone.

00:18:27.438 --> 00:18:28.708 line:93%
Okay, ma'am.

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:32.609 line:93%
Be very sweet,

00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:34.748 line:93%
and pretend to be my boyfriend.

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:35.809 line:93%
Okay?

00:18:36.918 --> 00:18:38.018 line:93%
So...

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:41.619 line:93%
So you're not giving this to me as my sister.

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:43.718 line:93%
You're paying me to act as your boyfriend.

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:46.928 line:93%
Get up. Let's practice.

00:18:48.028 --> 00:18:49.899 line:93%
Why are we doing this?

00:18:50.498 --> 00:18:51.629 line:93%
Are you...

00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:54.228 line:93%
trying to make the guy jealous?

00:18:54.928 --> 00:18:56.028 line:93%
No.

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:59.869 line:93%
This is to protect my last bit of dignity.

00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:05.678 line:93%
I still don't get why we're doing this.

00:19:05.738 --> 00:19:06.809 line:93%
But this is a bit fun in its own way.

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:09.478 line:93%
Hey, smile. Smile like you love me.

00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:12.278 line:93%
Have you gone mad?

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:14.488 line:93%
Smile. Smile.

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:18.458 line:93%
You're so funny.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:21.188 line:93%
- You're so funny. - Really.

00:19:21.758 --> 00:19:23.599 line:93%
See? We can smile together.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:24.859 line:93%
Oh, was it that funny?

00:19:27.928 --> 00:19:30.768 line:93%
Why do you have something on your face?

00:19:30.768 --> 00:19:31.839 line:93%
You're scaring me.

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.238 line:93%
- I told you to smile. - I am smiling.

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:35.609 line:93%
Hello. Are you coming back from lunch?

00:19:36.168 --> 00:19:37.178 line:93%
Yes.

00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:39.809 line:93%
This is my boyfriend.

00:19:44.278 --> 00:19:46.748 line:93%
Hello, I am Sunwoo Hyuk.

00:19:48.018 --> 00:19:49.549 line:93%
Hello, I am Seo Ji Ho.

00:19:50.258 --> 00:19:51.889 line:93%
It hurts, sis!

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.159 line:93%
Is she your sister?

00:19:54.589 --> 00:19:56.458 line:93%
Why did you call me by my nickname?

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:58.859 line:93%
Let's go.

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:00.468 line:93%
That's her nickname.

00:20:01.668 --> 00:20:02.899 line:93%
Let's talk.

00:20:03.668 --> 00:20:04.668 line:93%
Hey,

00:20:05.468 --> 00:20:07.438 line:93%
you know where your sister works, right?

00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:08.539 line:93%
Yes. Well...

00:20:10.278 --> 00:20:11.478 line:93%
Go there, and wait.

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:13.549 line:93%
Are... Are you talking to me?

00:20:47.178 --> 00:20:48.349 line:93%
Ji Soo.

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:54.089 line:93%
What are you doing right now?

00:20:55.188 --> 00:20:56.188 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:20:56.518 --> 00:20:57.889 line:93%
You said you don't like me.

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:00.028 line:93%
Then why did you make your brother pretend...

00:21:00.028 --> 00:21:01.258 line:93%
to be your boyfriend in front of me?

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:05.829 line:93%
It's for my self-respect.

00:21:07.428 --> 00:21:09.369 line:93%
I wanted to stop liking...

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.069 line:93%
a man who likes another woman.

00:21:12.139 --> 00:21:13.309 line:93%
I "like another woman"?

00:21:15.168 --> 00:21:17.539 line:93%
Your sister and Mr. Baker know about it too.

00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:19.109 line:93%
And you said it yourself.

00:21:19.109 --> 00:21:20.508 line:93%
You said that there's a woman you like.

00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:24.649 line:93%
I knew it. I knew about everything.

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.918 line:93%
But you kept treating me nicely,

00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:32.889 line:93%
so I thought you might've started liking me.

00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:34.329 line:93%
But I do like you.

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:38.799 line:93%
What?

00:21:41.168 --> 00:21:43.468 line:93%
The woman my sister and my brother-in-law...

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:46.299 line:93%
talked about before...

00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:48.409 line:93%
was my first love.

00:21:50.879 --> 00:21:52.008 line:93%
I was so happy to see her.

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:54.008 line:93%
I reunited with her after 10 years.

00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:57.918 line:93%
10 years ago,

00:21:58.379 --> 00:22:00.549 line:93%
she suddenly disappeared,

00:22:00.688 --> 00:22:02.549 line:93%
so she always had a place in my heart.

00:22:04.218 --> 00:22:06.289 line:93%
I accidentally ran into her after 10 years,

00:22:06.928 --> 00:22:09.129 line:93%
but she was going through a lot of things.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.428 line:93%
She helped me a lot in the past,

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:16.028 line:93%
so I cared about her, and I ended up helping her.

00:22:19.768 --> 00:22:22.369 line:93%
And that made me mix up friendship with love.

00:22:24.139 --> 00:22:25.238 line:93%
"Mix up"?

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:27.978 line:93%
She was going through many terrible things.

00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:31.218 line:93%
I thought I was worried about her...

00:22:31.218 --> 00:22:32.319 line:93%
because I still like her.

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:34.149 line:93%
But it wasn't that.

00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:38.319 line:93%
I came to realize that while caring for you.

00:22:39.089 --> 00:22:41.289 line:93%
I realized that she never made my heart flutter.

00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:46.599 line:93%
At a certain point,

00:22:48.028 --> 00:22:50.139 line:93%
I started smiling when I thought about you.

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:52.899 line:93%
And I couldn't stop thinking about you.

00:22:55.938 --> 00:22:57.139 line:93%
My heart fluttered.

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:32.708 line:93%
Is there no bread you like?

00:23:32.879 --> 00:23:33.909 line:93%
Well...

00:23:34.478 --> 00:23:37.549 line:93%
I'm here for Ji Soo. I'm waiting for her here.

00:23:38.018 --> 00:23:39.418 line:93%
Ji Soo?

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:40.418 line:93%
Yes.

00:23:41.448 --> 00:23:44.589 line:93%
How are you related to Ji Soo?

00:23:45.889 --> 00:23:46.889 line:93%
Well...

00:23:47.488 --> 00:23:49.129 line:93%
What should I say?

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:50.799 line:93%
We are...

00:23:51.498 --> 00:23:53.069 line:93%
very close.

00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:59.938 line:93%
Very close? That can't be possible.

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:03.738 line:93%
You are not a student.

00:24:04.379 --> 00:24:06.708 line:93%
You are not an office worker either.

00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:12.018 line:93%
I sense something dark.

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:15.149 line:93%
You work at night, don't you?

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:19.319 line:93%
Are you a psychic?

00:24:19.319 --> 00:24:20.688 line:93%
You're a womanizer, aren't you?

00:24:21.488 --> 00:24:23.099 line:93%
You jerk.

00:24:23.198 --> 00:24:26.329 line:93%
You must be the one who made Ji Soo sad.

00:24:26.329 --> 00:24:27.498 line:93%
"Womanizer"?

00:24:27.498 --> 00:24:29.629 line:93%
Watch your mouth.

00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:34.468 line:93%
- What did you say? - What are you doing?

00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:36.909 line:93%
What's your profession? What's your address?

00:24:37.938 --> 00:24:39.438 line:93%
Tell me your military serial number.

00:24:39.438 --> 00:24:40.448 line:93%
Wait.

00:24:41.109 --> 00:24:43.178 line:93%
I am Ji Soo's little brother.

00:24:43.178 --> 00:24:45.448 line:93%
- "Little brother"? - Yes.

00:24:45.448 --> 00:24:47.319 line:93%
She doesn't have a little brother this big.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.018 line:93%
Come on. Seriously.

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:52.018 line:93%
Ask my sister then.

00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:54.928 line:93%
Today is seriously not going well.

00:24:57.059 --> 00:25:00.528 line:93%
Are you really her little brother?

00:25:00.528 --> 00:25:01.629 line:93%
Yes.

00:25:02.899 --> 00:25:05.369 line:93%
You should've told me. Wait, you did.

00:25:05.998 --> 00:25:09.008 line:93%
You look so different.

00:25:10.478 --> 00:25:11.508 line:93%
I am sorry.

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:14.678 line:93%
Hey, you should have this. Here.

00:25:15.849 --> 00:25:19.218 line:93%
My gosh, your family has good genes.

00:25:19.218 --> 00:25:20.988 line:93%
You're all very tall.

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:22.748 line:93%
We don't share genes.

00:25:22.748 --> 00:25:23.758 line:93%
What?

00:25:23.988 --> 00:25:26.089 line:93%
- Oh, it was nothing. - Okay.

00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:28.228 line:93%
- Thank you. - Okay then.

00:25:30.928 --> 00:25:31.958 line:93%
What?

00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:34.299 line:93%
Why did you come together?

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:35.468 line:93%
Let me talk to him.

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:37.569 line:93%
Seo Ji Ho.

00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:39.569 line:93%
Yes?

00:25:39.569 --> 00:25:42.208 line:93%
Why did you pretend to be her boyfriend?

00:25:42.768 --> 00:25:44.178 line:93%
Thank you.

00:25:45.678 --> 00:25:46.748 line:93%
What?

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:48.349 line:93%
Thanks to you,

00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:50.349 line:93%
our misunderstanding has been cleared up.

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:53.718 line:93%
My name is Sunwoo Hyuk. Just call me Hyuk.

00:25:55.018 --> 00:25:56.149 line:93%
Wait.

00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:57.988 line:93%
Why would I...

00:25:59.188 --> 00:26:01.829 line:93%
address you by your name?

00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:04.299 line:93%
I'm your sister's boyfriend. You should.

00:26:04.859 --> 00:26:05.899 line:93%
What?

00:26:06.968 --> 00:26:07.998 line:93%
Ji Soo,

00:26:08.399 --> 00:26:11.839 line:93%
what happened? Explain this to me.

00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:15.909 line:93%
Yes, you should. I need to hear it too.

00:26:25.718 --> 00:26:28.218 line:93%
Excuse me. Who is Ms. Lee Soo A?

00:26:29.448 --> 00:26:30.758 line:93%
It's me.

00:26:30.758 --> 00:26:31.918 line:93%
Right.

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.859 line:93%
This is from Mr. Seo Tae Soo.

00:26:36.498 --> 00:26:38.159 line:93%
- "Seo Tae Soo"? - Yes.

00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:39.869 line:93%
Have a good day.

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.039 line:93%
Who is Mr. Seo Tae Soo?

00:26:46.168 --> 00:26:47.309 line:93%
He's my father-in-law.

00:26:48.168 --> 00:26:49.208 line:93%
What could this be?

00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:52.579 line:93%
Maybe he found out that you lied about...

00:26:52.579 --> 00:26:53.809 line:93%
going to the seminar?

00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:56.178 line:93%
Did he send a surprise gift...

00:26:56.178 --> 00:26:57.418 line:93%
to make you feel better?

00:26:57.718 --> 00:26:58.918 line:93%
I don't think so.

00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:02.619 line:93%
You're lucky to have a sweet father-in-law.

00:27:02.889 --> 00:27:04.458 line:93%
Open it. I want to know what it is.

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:18.599 line:93%
Mr. Seo,

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:20.708 line:93%
this is from your wife.

00:27:21.008 --> 00:27:22.268 line:93%
Okay.

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:35.049 line:93%
It's from your father,

00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:37.458 line:93%
but I am not in the position to take this.

00:28:03.778 --> 00:28:05.778 line:93%
My training schedule has been moved forward,

00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:07.718 line:93%
so I am going to Busan right now.

00:28:08.089 --> 00:28:09.718 line:93%
Let's talk later.

00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:26.909 line:93%
You made me realize that I'm a useless dad,

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.409 line:93%
and I've realized it.

00:28:29.008 --> 00:28:30.178 line:93%
So...

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.809 line:93%
just leave me alone now.

00:28:34.278 --> 00:28:37.178 line:93%
I hate everything now. All of you.

00:28:51.758 --> 00:28:52.799 line:93%
(Ji An)

00:28:54.468 --> 00:28:55.698 line:93%
Yes, Ji An.

00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:58.668 line:93%
Dad's phone is off again.

00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:01.139 line:93%
Is Dad okay?

00:29:02.668 --> 00:29:05.579 line:93%
I don't know. I think he got sick of me.

00:29:05.579 --> 00:29:06.708 line:93%
He wouldn't even look at me.

00:29:08.008 --> 00:29:10.918 line:93%
I need to make up with him before he leaves.

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.418 line:93%
But what about him?

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:19.758 line:93%
I am a little busy right now.

00:29:19.928 --> 00:29:21.188 line:93%
I will hang up now.

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.528 line:93%
Is it Ji An?

00:29:28.829 --> 00:29:29.869 line:93%
Yes.

00:29:31.539 --> 00:29:33.039 line:93%
I see that the restaurant is doing well.

00:29:35.069 --> 00:29:36.738 line:93%
I... I am working hard.

00:29:37.778 --> 00:29:40.109 line:93%
I gave this to you to support your daughter.

00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:41.909 line:93%
Why does your daughter stay outside?

00:29:44.278 --> 00:29:45.478 line:93%
I want to be the only one...

00:29:46.649 --> 00:29:47.988 line:93%
to take the humiliation.

00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:51.619 line:93%
Then stop being humiliated.

00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:54.589 line:93%
Pardon me?

00:29:54.928 --> 00:29:56.559 line:93%
Stop working here.

00:29:57.998 --> 00:29:59.528 line:93%
Right. Okay.

00:30:01.069 --> 00:30:03.498 line:93%
You must've found a new person to run it.

00:30:04.198 --> 00:30:07.008 line:93%
Then when should I stop?

00:30:07.738 --> 00:30:09.008 line:93%
Right now.

00:30:09.678 --> 00:30:10.778 line:93%
Right now?

00:30:10.778 --> 00:30:11.938 line:93%
You begged my husband...

00:30:11.938 --> 00:30:14.079 line:93%
not to make you run this restaurant.

00:30:14.649 --> 00:30:15.678 line:93%
Do you feel bad to let it go?

00:30:16.579 --> 00:30:18.018 line:93%
That's not it.

00:30:22.718 --> 00:30:24.688 line:93%
This is the salary for this month.

00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:26.488 line:93%
You worked hard anyway.

00:30:29.089 --> 00:30:30.458 line:93%
Okay.

00:30:33.468 --> 00:30:34.899 line:93%
Make sure...

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:36.498 line:93%
to tell Ji An about this.

00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:35.988 line:93%
(Dad)

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:38.428 line:93%
Dad.

00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:40.899 line:93%
Oh, are you Mr. Seo's daughter?

00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:44.168 line:93%
Yes. Who are you?

00:31:44.268 --> 00:31:45.998 line:93%
I am a paramedic.

00:31:46.168 --> 00:31:49.468 line:93%
I called the first person in his call history.

00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:51.039 line:93%
He collapsed,

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.778 line:93%
so he's going to the emergency room now.

00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:54.609 line:93%
My dad collapsed?

00:31:59.149 --> 00:32:02.119 line:93%
I told you that I don't need tests.

00:32:02.218 --> 00:32:04.688 line:93%
So let's talk when your family comes,

00:32:04.688 --> 00:32:06.159 line:93%
- I don't need it. - and you can leave then.

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.389 line:93%
- I have to go now. - Gosh. Please.

00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:09.458 line:93%
Dad.

00:32:10.359 --> 00:32:11.498 line:93%
Are you his family?

00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:13.899 line:93%
What happened to my dad?

00:32:14.168 --> 00:32:17.539 line:93%
I just felt a little dizzy. I'm okay.

00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:18.938 line:93%
I can go now.

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:22.069 line:93%
Sir, stop being stubborn. You should lie down.

00:32:22.069 --> 00:32:23.609 line:93%
You can't leave like this.

00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:26.309 line:93%
But I told you that I'm really fine, Doctor.

00:32:26.748 --> 00:32:28.409 line:93%
I want to get him a few tests,

00:32:28.409 --> 00:32:29.748 line:93%
but he insists that he'll go.

00:32:29.918 --> 00:32:31.978 line:93%
He even threw up blood in the ambulance.

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:34.589 line:93%
He... He threw up blood?

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.958 line:93%
He says that he had been fine until now.

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:38.319 line:93%
He says it's because...

00:32:38.319 --> 00:32:40.359 line:93%
he hasn't eaten since last night.

00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:41.359 line:93%
That's not true.

00:32:41.428 --> 00:32:44.659 line:93%
He often vomited and had stomach pains.

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:47.428 line:93%
He can neither eat nor sleep well.

00:32:47.528 --> 00:32:48.968 line:93%
"He often vomited and had stomach pains"?

00:32:49.228 --> 00:32:51.339 line:93%
I told you that it's not true.

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:54.069 line:93%
You have to check his stomach, doctor.

00:32:54.069 --> 00:32:56.478 line:93%
I said I'm okay. What's wrong with you?

00:32:57.109 --> 00:32:58.738 line:93%
Since you haven't eaten since last night,

00:32:58.738 --> 00:33:00.309 line:93%
you can be tested right now.

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.049 line:93%
Prepare a scan of his stomach,

00:33:02.049 --> 00:33:03.918 line:93%
and a gastroscopy.

00:33:03.918 --> 00:33:04.948 line:93%
Okay, Doctor.

00:33:09.248 --> 00:33:10.359 line:93%
Honey.

00:33:43.089 --> 00:33:45.119 line:93%
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:47.889 line:93%
He decided to become a sailor...

00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:49.998 line:93%
because of me even in that condition.

00:33:54.668 --> 00:33:56.869 line:93%
How's Dad? Where is he?

00:33:57.839 --> 00:34:00.569 line:93%
He's getting tested. It's almost done.

00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:03.778 line:93%
How sick must he be to collapse on the streets?

00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:07.379 line:93%
He collapsed in front of our house.

00:34:07.749 --> 00:34:09.849 line:93%
Our neighbor called 911.

00:34:11.318 --> 00:34:12.519 line:93%
But...

00:34:13.088 --> 00:34:16.189 line:93%
he had his luggage. Even his guitar.

00:34:16.318 --> 00:34:17.588 line:93%
"Luggage"?

00:34:18.988 --> 00:34:21.189 line:93%
Was he going to join the crew already?

00:34:22.028 --> 00:34:24.229 line:93%
He even threw up blood in the ambulance.

00:34:25.528 --> 00:34:27.869 line:93%
I don't understand. Didn't he say...

00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:29.628 line:93%
that he only had a stomach ulcer?

00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:31.269 line:93%
Yes.

00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:33.669 line:93%
But why are his symptoms just like...

00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:35.508 line:93%
what Grandmother and Seok Doo have shown?

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:39.678 line:93%
Is it possible...

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:42.648 line:93%
that he was hiding something from us?

00:34:43.278 --> 00:34:45.778 line:93%
He can't do that. I hope not.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:51.019 line:93%
He must've been so desperate to leave home.

00:34:52.858 --> 00:34:55.659 line:93%
Anyway, he doesn't have an insurance, does he?

00:34:56.898 --> 00:34:58.229 line:93%
He doesn't.

00:34:59.428 --> 00:35:01.669 line:93%
We cancelled everything when we went bankrupt.

00:35:03.499 --> 00:35:05.169 line:93%
He only left one for me.

00:35:06.068 --> 00:35:07.209 line:93%
Perhaps...

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:10.178 line:93%
he hid it from us because of the medical fee?

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:12.108 line:93%
He told me the other day...

00:35:12.108 --> 00:35:13.678 line:93%
that he won't burden us with his medical fees.

00:35:17.579 --> 00:35:18.619 line:93%
What if...

00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:22.189 line:93%
What if...

00:35:22.448 --> 00:35:24.119 line:93%
he really has cancer?

00:35:24.488 --> 00:35:26.159 line:93%
Don't say that.

00:35:28.389 --> 00:35:30.829 line:93%
It can't be true. It's impossible.

00:35:31.758 --> 00:35:33.298 line:93%
Is Mr. Seo's family here?

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.428 line:93%
His tests are finished.

00:35:42.952 --> 00:35:47.952 line:93%
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E38 My Golden Life "I'm Ready To Go"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:35:55.889 --> 00:35:57.519 line:93%
Wait. What?

00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:01.329 line:93%
What are you doing, Dad?

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:03.059 line:93%
I am going home.

00:36:05.028 --> 00:36:06.669 line:93%
The doctor said you have to stay here...

00:36:06.669 --> 00:36:08.568 line:93%
until the results come out.

00:36:08.628 --> 00:36:11.398 line:93%
You've become weak, so you need to stay here.

00:36:11.398 --> 00:36:13.108 line:93%
I said I'm okay.

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:15.169 line:93%
Dad, what's wrong with you?

00:36:16.479 --> 00:36:17.878 line:93%
Let's talk at home.

00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:19.639 line:93%
Please, Honey.

00:36:26.278 --> 00:36:27.718 line:93%
I will fix the bed for you.

00:36:28.648 --> 00:36:30.289 line:93%
I will take some rest.

00:36:30.818 --> 00:36:32.459 line:93%
You should all go now.

00:36:35.189 --> 00:36:37.698 line:93%
How can we go when you're unwell?

00:36:38.128 --> 00:36:41.568 line:93%
Where were you going with your luggage?

00:36:42.229 --> 00:36:44.238 line:93%
The training has been moved forward,

00:36:44.238 --> 00:36:46.269 line:93%
so I was leaving early.

00:36:46.568 --> 00:36:48.269 line:93%
I wrote it here.

00:36:49.068 --> 00:36:50.979 line:93%
You're undernourished.

00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:52.608 line:93%
You can't go deep-sea fishing like that.

00:36:52.608 --> 00:36:54.349 line:93%
You even collapsed in the street.

00:36:54.448 --> 00:36:56.519 line:93%
I heard you even threw up blood.

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:58.448 line:93%
You're not going deep-sea fishing.

00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:00.948 line:93%
I called them.

00:37:02.318 --> 00:37:04.419 line:93%
Who? Who did you call?

00:37:04.419 --> 00:37:05.488 line:93%
How did you know who to call?

00:37:05.488 --> 00:37:08.059 line:93%
I checked all the deep-sea fishing vessels in Busan.

00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:10.329 line:93%
You weren't on the list.

00:37:11.298 --> 00:37:13.169 line:93%
You cancelled on the agency....

00:37:13.169 --> 00:37:14.468 line:93%
and said you won't go.

00:37:16.128 --> 00:37:18.439 line:93%
If it's not that you're going deep-sea fishing,

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.838 line:93%
where were you planning to go?

00:37:23.738 --> 00:37:27.309 line:93%
I just wanted to stay alone for a while.

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:31.479 line:93%
Stay alone? Where?

00:37:31.479 --> 00:37:34.648 line:93%
It doesn't matter. I was going to travel around.

00:37:35.389 --> 00:37:37.789 line:93%
Why did you tell us you'd go deep-sea fishing then?

00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:41.959 line:93%
I didn't want you to ask me where I'm going.

00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:44.428 line:93%
Then what about the medical check-up?

00:37:44.499 --> 00:37:45.858 line:93%
You didn't even have one, did you?

00:37:46.468 --> 00:37:48.528 line:93%
Why did you tell us you had one?

00:37:51.468 --> 00:37:53.409 line:93%
Dad.

00:37:54.568 --> 00:37:56.608 line:93%
Is it because you knew...

00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:58.278 line:93%
about your health condition?

00:38:00.508 --> 00:38:01.548 line:93%
Tae Soo.

00:38:02.178 --> 00:38:03.349 line:93%
Answer us.

00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:05.648 line:93%
Why did you lie to us?

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:10.289 line:93%
Because I don't want to get treatment.

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:12.419 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:38:12.818 --> 00:38:14.959 line:93%
Whatever the result is,

00:38:15.588 --> 00:38:17.128 line:93%
I won't get treatment.

00:38:18.959 --> 00:38:20.198 line:93%
Dad.

00:38:20.528 --> 00:38:23.499 line:93%
I don't care if it's stage 1, 2, or 3.

00:38:27.669 --> 00:38:29.539 line:93%
Then you knew about this?

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:32.238 line:93%
Dad, what does that mean?

00:38:32.238 --> 00:38:33.508 line:93%
Why would you not get treatment?

00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:36.209 line:93%
Do you want to just die like this?

00:38:37.479 --> 00:38:38.579 line:93%
What's wrong with that?

00:38:38.718 --> 00:38:40.048 line:93%
- Dad. - Dad.

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:46.358 line:93%
This was my first time.

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.588 line:93%
This was my first time to get things my way.

00:38:50.258 --> 00:38:52.428 line:93%
For the past 63 years,

00:38:52.428 --> 00:38:53.798 line:93%
I've never lived as I pleased.

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:55.428 line:93%
Not even for a single day.

00:38:56.499 --> 00:38:58.939 line:93%
So I'll die the way I want.

00:38:59.738 --> 00:39:01.309 line:93%
That's ridiculous.

00:39:01.738 --> 00:39:04.079 line:93%
How could you say such a thing?

00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:05.709 line:93%
What about us?

00:39:05.709 --> 00:39:07.079 line:93%
What should we do when you say that?

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:08.778 line:93%
Don't you even care about us?

00:39:09.108 --> 00:39:10.548 line:93%
Yes, I won't care about you.

00:39:11.178 --> 00:39:12.749 line:93%
I'm glad I'm dying.

00:39:12.749 --> 00:39:14.488 line:93%
Why would I get treatment to barely stay alive?

00:39:14.849 --> 00:39:16.619 line:93%
I couldn't choose how to live my life,

00:39:17.358 --> 00:39:18.718 line:93%
but I'll choose how to die.

00:39:19.389 --> 00:39:21.959 line:93%
Were you going to die alone?

00:39:22.428 --> 00:39:25.159 line:93%
Is that why you were leaving alone like that?

00:39:25.159 --> 00:39:26.499 line:93%
I told you.

00:39:26.499 --> 00:39:28.468 line:93%
I'll live my own life from now on.

00:39:28.968 --> 00:39:31.099 line:93%
Dad, how could you say that?

00:39:31.099 --> 00:39:32.769 line:93%
Why would you only care about you?

00:39:32.769 --> 00:39:35.409 line:93%
He's right. Don't you even care about your children?

00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:38.878 line:93%
What's so wrong not to care about them?

00:39:39.639 --> 00:39:41.608 line:93%
Why can't I care only about me?

00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:49.318 line:93%
I've lived my entire life for my family.

00:39:49.548 --> 00:39:52.659 line:93%
Whether I was good or not, I lived for my family.

00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:54.729 line:93%
Now, I want to live...

00:39:55.428 --> 00:39:56.528 line:93%
my life...

00:39:56.528 --> 00:39:58.229 line:93%
the way I want to.

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.999 line:93%
Why would you blame me for that?

00:40:00.769 --> 00:40:02.198 line:93%
Did I do you any harm?

00:40:02.898 --> 00:40:04.369 line:93%
Did I cause you any trouble?

00:40:07.139 --> 00:40:08.269 line:93%
Do you want us...

00:40:09.878 --> 00:40:11.108 line:93%
to just watch you...

00:40:11.678 --> 00:40:13.148 line:93%
die like that?

00:40:13.749 --> 00:40:17.318 line:93%
It will only break your children's hearts.

00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:20.619 line:93%
Dad, you're being too selfish.

00:40:20.988 --> 00:40:22.189 line:93%
I don't care.

00:40:23.289 --> 00:40:24.988 line:93%
Even if you regret it...

00:40:24.988 --> 00:40:27.358 line:93%
and become remorseful after I die,

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.229 line:93%
I don't care about it. It's none of my business.

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:32.128 line:93%
Tae Soo.

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.698 line:93%
It's because I want to stop everything now.

00:40:36.539 --> 00:40:38.198 line:93%
I want to stop.

00:40:39.269 --> 00:40:40.568 line:93%
It's okay not to live...

00:40:40.568 --> 00:40:42.439 line:93%
if I have no reason to live.

00:40:43.979 --> 00:40:46.178 line:93%
It's not that I'm committing suicide.

00:40:46.178 --> 00:40:48.249 line:93%
They are just calling me from up above.

00:40:49.209 --> 00:40:50.749 line:93%
It's that simple to me.

00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:02.988 line:93%
I want to rest.

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:05.798 line:93%
I want to rest now.

00:41:06.628 --> 00:41:07.669 line:93%
You guys...

00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:10.698 line:93%
will live your own life.

00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:13.409 line:93%
That's what children do.

00:41:35.588 --> 00:41:36.959 line:93%
Now, I want...

00:41:38.928 --> 00:41:40.499 line:93%
to quit everything.

00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:12.059 line:93%
Your dad...

00:42:14.028 --> 00:42:15.468 line:93%
knew about it.

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:18.468 line:93%
He knew it.

00:42:20.968 --> 00:42:23.139 line:93%
What did the doctor say?

00:42:26.209 --> 00:42:28.249 line:93%
He has some symptoms,

00:42:28.278 --> 00:42:29.778 line:93%
and his family has...

00:42:29.778 --> 00:42:31.378 line:93%
a history of stomach cancer.

00:42:31.718 --> 00:42:33.818 line:93%
So there's a possibility of stomach cancer.

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:38.119 line:93%
But we should wait for the biopsy results.

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:41.258 line:93%
He wasn't like that before.

00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:46.128 line:93%
He only cared about his family.

00:42:48.068 --> 00:42:49.838 line:93%
But now, he wants to die alone?

00:42:52.669 --> 00:42:53.709 line:93%
Ji An.

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:56.738 line:93%
Is that really...

00:42:58.139 --> 00:42:59.508 line:93%
what Dad meant?

00:43:00.979 --> 00:43:03.519 line:93%
Did he mean that he wants to die alone?

00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:06.278 line:93%
Dad knew, but he lied to all of us,

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:08.849 line:93%
didn't he?

00:43:11.218 --> 00:43:13.729 line:93%
He even left a will to me the other day.

00:43:14.488 --> 00:43:15.889 line:93%
It was his will.

00:43:17.258 --> 00:43:18.499 line:93%
What should we do?

00:43:20.568 --> 00:43:22.298 line:93%
We've seen him so far.

00:43:23.269 --> 00:43:25.999 line:93%
He must've been in so much pain alone.

00:43:30.409 --> 00:43:33.178 line:93%
I didn't know he'd be like that.

00:43:35.048 --> 00:43:36.479 line:93%
Just because I know...

00:43:36.479 --> 00:43:38.148 line:93%
and understand you all...

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:39.919 line:93%
doesn't mean I didn't feel miserable.

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.218 line:93%
So I cowed around you.

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:45.919 line:93%
I pretended not to care and smiled along, but...

00:43:45.919 --> 00:43:48.588 line:93%
now, I'm sick of tiptoeing around you all the time.

00:43:49.959 --> 00:43:51.959 line:93%
If he's that bad...

00:43:55.229 --> 00:43:57.398 line:93%
Grandma had a surgery in stage three, right?

00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:01.169 line:93%
Why would you all think he has stomach cancer?

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:02.939 line:93%
We don't know yet.

00:44:07.508 --> 00:44:08.648 line:93%
For now, we should...

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:11.579 line:93%
wait until the results are out tomorrow.

00:44:12.218 --> 00:44:14.119 line:93%
And we should persuade him to get treatment then.

00:44:14.548 --> 00:44:16.218 line:93%
Is he doing this because of money?

00:44:17.019 --> 00:44:18.289 line:93%
Because of the hospital bills?

00:44:22.789 --> 00:44:24.099 line:93%
Gosh, this is irritating.

00:44:25.798 --> 00:44:26.869 line:93%
No.

00:44:27.869 --> 00:44:29.999 line:93%
He can't die already.

00:44:31.269 --> 00:44:32.269 line:93%
I should get going.

00:44:38.979 --> 00:44:40.878 line:93%
Soo A doesn't know about this yet, right?

00:44:43.479 --> 00:44:45.419 line:93%
Does the training end this week?

00:44:45.479 --> 00:44:47.919 line:93%
Don't tell her before she comes back.

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:49.218 line:93%
She'd only be depressed.

00:44:50.059 --> 00:44:54.088 line:93%
Well, what should we do with Ji Soo?

00:44:57.159 --> 00:44:58.798 line:93%
Don't tell her...

00:44:58.798 --> 00:44:59.898 line:93%
until the results are out.

00:45:07.468 --> 00:45:08.869 line:93%
You two are dating now?

00:45:08.968 --> 00:45:11.479 line:93%
Yes. Today is their first day.

00:45:12.778 --> 00:45:15.178 line:93%
Hyuk, what happened?

00:45:15.178 --> 00:45:17.718 line:93%
I knew Ji Soo liked him though.

00:45:17.948 --> 00:45:19.318 line:93%
I asked her out first.

00:45:19.318 --> 00:45:21.749 line:93%
What? I asked you out first.

00:45:21.889 --> 00:45:23.559 line:93%
You were going to do it,

00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:25.588 line:93%
but I stopped you.

00:45:25.588 --> 00:45:28.389 line:93%
That means I asked you out first.

00:45:29.528 --> 00:45:31.459 line:93%
Gosh, Hyuk.

00:45:33.369 --> 00:45:36.499 line:93%
You didn't know he'd be so romantic and tough, right?

00:45:37.338 --> 00:45:39.439 line:93%
I hope we will get along well.

00:45:39.639 --> 00:45:41.709 line:93%
I was going to say the same thing.

00:45:42.738 --> 00:45:44.809 line:93%
I've made sustained efforts...

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:47.849 line:93%
to make them a couple. Yes.

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:49.878 line:93%
I sent you two to Incheon together, right?

00:45:49.878 --> 00:45:51.579 line:93%
I even made him buy her lunch.

00:45:51.579 --> 00:45:53.148 line:93%
Most importantly,

00:45:53.148 --> 00:45:55.849 line:93%
I told her everything about women in his life.

00:45:56.189 --> 00:45:58.559 line:93%
My goodness. I'm sorry.

00:45:59.928 --> 00:46:02.459 line:93%
Hee, he's quite talkative.

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:04.928 line:93%
He spreads groundless, speculative rumors.

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:07.099 line:93%
Hey, that's not true.

00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:09.468 line:93%
He wouldn't say anything groundless.

00:46:10.039 --> 00:46:11.398 line:93%
That's my Nam Goo.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.068 line:93%
Gosh, that's my wife.

00:46:14.068 --> 00:46:15.269 line:93%
You're so good.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:17.139 line:93%
You should watch your mouth.

00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:19.709 line:93%
Hyuk wouldn't say anything...

00:46:19.709 --> 00:46:21.448 line:93%
that's not true.

00:46:21.608 --> 00:46:23.419 line:93%
She's right about that.

00:46:23.749 --> 00:46:26.588 line:93%
Gosh, that's my girlfriend.

00:46:27.488 --> 00:46:30.318 line:93%
- My goodness. - Gosh, look at them.

00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:32.258 line:93%
What?

00:47:07.729 --> 00:47:09.798 line:93%
I need something with a fast beat.

00:47:12.258 --> 00:47:13.568 line:93%
Is he very busy?

00:47:13.769 --> 00:47:14.829 line:93%
(0.1 million)

00:47:16.468 --> 00:47:17.599 line:93%
Hello?

00:47:17.669 --> 00:47:19.398 line:93%
Hey, Cinderella.

00:47:22.508 --> 00:47:23.539 line:93%
Come on out.

00:47:23.979 --> 00:47:24.979 line:93%
Right now?

00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:27.778 line:93%
Hey, are you at a club?

00:47:40.229 --> 00:47:41.689 line:93%
Hey, what are you doing?

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:45.099 line:93%
Are you here to drink and not to work?

00:47:49.398 --> 00:47:50.439 line:93%
Hey!

00:47:57.738 --> 00:47:59.809 line:93%
Hi, Cinderella.

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.749 line:93%
Why are you here?

00:48:03.079 --> 00:48:04.249 line:93%
He's crazy.

00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:06.079 line:93%
You called me.

00:48:06.278 --> 00:48:07.318 line:93%
Did I?

00:48:08.789 --> 00:48:11.919 line:93%
Cinderella has to go home...

00:48:12.258 --> 00:48:13.659 line:93%
at midnight.

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:16.289 line:93%
I couldn't have called you.

00:48:18.398 --> 00:48:20.829 line:93%
How much did you drink? Are you okay?

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:22.068 line:93%
Look at me.

00:48:22.468 --> 00:48:24.369 line:93%
Look. See?

00:48:26.439 --> 00:48:28.209 line:93%
No problem.

00:48:33.608 --> 00:48:36.648 line:93%
Hey, not here. Swallow it.

00:48:36.778 --> 00:48:38.378 line:93%
Let's go to the toilet, okay?

00:48:49.428 --> 00:48:50.459 line:93%
Hey.

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:56.269 line:93%
Cinderella gave me a potion.

00:48:57.869 --> 00:48:59.838 line:93%
Stop talking nonsense, and drink it already.

00:49:00.738 --> 00:49:03.678 line:93%
You're a mess. I wanted to have fun.

00:49:08.608 --> 00:49:11.778 line:93%
Why are you spending money where you work?

00:49:13.919 --> 00:49:15.988 line:93%
Because the world is messed up.

00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:20.729 line:93%
Because I'm scared!

00:49:21.689 --> 00:49:22.858 line:93%
You startled me.

00:49:25.858 --> 00:49:27.099 line:93%
Did something happen to you?

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:29.298 line:93%
To me?

00:49:31.298 --> 00:49:34.968 line:93%
All sorts of things happen to me every day.

00:49:37.238 --> 00:49:38.439 line:93%
What happened?

00:49:38.979 --> 00:49:40.678 line:93%
You listened to my problems.

00:49:40.678 --> 00:49:42.079 line:93%
I'll listen to yours too.

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.119 line:93%
Talk to me.

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:47.488 line:93%
Is it about the franchise?

00:49:48.249 --> 00:49:50.189 line:93%
Yes, the franchise.

00:49:50.959 --> 00:49:52.459 line:93%
I need to get that done soon.

00:49:53.289 --> 00:49:54.928 line:93%
I need to own a business...

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.858 line:93%
and make a lot of money.

00:50:01.928 --> 00:50:04.099 line:93%
I'm going to make money now.

00:50:09.508 --> 00:50:12.079 line:93%
But what if my dad dies before that?

00:50:14.448 --> 00:50:15.909 line:93%
Is he sick?

00:50:23.159 --> 00:50:24.289 line:93%
Hey.

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:29.389 line:93%
Just wait, and see.

00:50:30.198 --> 00:50:31.729 line:93%
I'll become very rich.

00:50:32.528 --> 00:50:35.128 line:93%
My parents won't ever worry about medical bills.

00:50:40.738 --> 00:50:42.039 line:93%
Just wait!

00:50:42.769 --> 00:50:45.178 line:93%
CEO Seo Ji Ho's coming!

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.409 line:93%
Let's go.

00:50:52.948 --> 00:50:53.948 line:93%
Hey!

00:50:57.358 --> 00:51:02.189 line:93%
Show me the money, money. Money...

00:51:02.628 --> 00:51:05.358 line:93%
I wish I had lots of money

00:51:06.468 --> 00:51:08.229 line:93%
Money, money

00:51:08.229 --> 00:51:09.738 line:93%
Be quiet.

00:51:09.738 --> 00:51:10.898 line:93%
My gosh. Seriously.

00:51:11.698 --> 00:51:13.108 line:93%
This is really driving me insane.

00:51:16.939 --> 00:51:19.178 line:93%
People live in places like this too?

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:21.008 line:93%
How fascinating.

00:51:23.178 --> 00:51:25.349 line:93%
Hey, you're not alone here!

00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:26.849 line:93%
My goodness. Oh, no.

00:51:35.128 --> 00:51:36.599 line:93%
Why is he so late?

00:51:47.608 --> 00:51:49.369 line:93%
Mr. Park, what happened?

00:51:49.568 --> 00:51:51.838 line:93%
My apologies. He had a lot of drinks.

00:51:52.039 --> 00:51:53.409 line:93%
Thank you, Mr. Park.

00:51:53.709 --> 00:51:54.709 line:93%
Wait.

00:51:57.278 --> 00:51:58.448 line:93%
Here.

00:51:58.778 --> 00:51:59.919 line:93%
Take this.

00:52:24.909 --> 00:52:25.979 line:93%
Take a shower.

00:52:26.778 --> 00:52:28.148 line:93%
I don't want to.

00:52:28.508 --> 00:52:31.178 line:93%
You can't do this around the hired help.

00:52:33.448 --> 00:52:34.789 line:93%
Hey, No Myung Hee.

00:52:36.858 --> 00:52:38.689 line:93%
Why did we get married?

00:52:41.189 --> 00:52:42.528 line:93%
Just take a shower.

00:52:49.169 --> 00:52:51.539 line:93%
Why did you marry me?

00:52:53.568 --> 00:52:55.809 line:93%
Did I get married to become a vice chairman?

00:52:58.409 --> 00:52:59.439 line:93%
That's not it.

00:52:59.979 --> 00:53:02.108 line:93%
I got married to become a chairman.

00:53:04.878 --> 00:53:05.878 line:93%
Didn't I?

00:53:09.148 --> 00:53:11.619 line:93%
But he's testing me for too long.

00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:13.258 line:93%
Chairman No Yang Ho.

00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:15.159 line:93%
Your father.

00:53:15.988 --> 00:53:17.298 line:93%
Choi Jae Sung.

00:53:18.059 --> 00:53:20.428 line:93%
He's tested me for years and years.

00:53:21.468 --> 00:53:22.499 line:93%
For all my life.

00:53:23.238 --> 00:53:24.539 line:93%
I'm sick of it.

00:53:47.159 --> 00:53:50.659 line:93%
Hyuk, I'll spend the night with my family today.

00:53:51.028 --> 00:53:52.729 line:93%
I'll tell you about my dad tomorrow.

00:53:56.468 --> 00:53:58.398 line:93%
Ji An's staying at home tonight.

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:00.809 line:93%
I didn't ask.

00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:03.378 line:93%
Right.

00:54:06.948 --> 00:54:09.309 line:93%
You're pretty two-faced.

00:54:10.678 --> 00:54:13.519 line:93%
You and Ji An go into each other's rooms at night.

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:16.959 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:54:16.959 --> 00:54:19.689 line:93%
You're feigning ignorance in front of a witness?

00:54:20.988 --> 00:54:22.858 line:93%
You can't do that here.

00:54:23.198 --> 00:54:24.499 line:93%
It's a yellow card. Once more and it's a red.

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:26.968 line:93%
If you do it again, it'll be a red card.

00:54:27.329 --> 00:54:28.669 line:93%
You'll get out right away.

00:54:31.738 --> 00:54:33.338 line:93%
Who did what at night?

00:54:45.878 --> 00:54:47.088 line:93%
It wasn't a dream?

00:54:49.389 --> 00:54:51.318 line:93%
Did she nurse me all night?

00:55:01.999 --> 00:55:03.169 line:93%
Should family members...

00:55:04.039 --> 00:55:05.769 line:93%
always do everything together?

00:55:06.539 --> 00:55:10.709 line:93%
But you should at least give us a chance.

00:55:11.278 --> 00:55:13.508 line:93%
You should at least give us a chance.

00:55:14.048 --> 00:55:16.619 line:93%
I want to be alone without my family now.

00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:19.689 line:93%
Don't think about your family now.

00:55:20.419 --> 00:55:22.249 line:93%
Do whatever makes you happy.

00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:26.159 line:93%
Dad...

00:55:40.639 --> 00:55:42.539 line:93%
How can he say he wants to die...

00:55:43.008 --> 00:55:44.508 line:93%
so nonchalantly?

00:55:49.778 --> 00:55:51.178 line:93%
I'll deal with it.

00:55:51.178 --> 00:55:53.588 line:93%
I'm no longer a child.

00:55:53.818 --> 00:55:54.889 line:93%
Stop it.

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:57.419 line:93%
You don't know why I'm like this.

00:55:58.019 --> 00:55:59.588 line:93%
It's not like your times.

00:55:59.588 --> 00:56:00.588 line:93%
I won't do...

00:56:01.229 --> 00:56:02.789 line:93%
anything I'll regret.

00:56:03.028 --> 00:56:04.959 line:93%
How could you do that?

00:56:05.758 --> 00:56:07.128 line:93%
Are you both crazy?

00:56:07.398 --> 00:56:08.628 line:93%
How could you...

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.898 line:93%
How could you do something like that?

00:56:12.139 --> 00:56:15.769 line:93%
Did it never occur to you...

00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:19.678 line:93%
to ask why we did that and what we were thinking?

00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:21.278 line:93%
What's there to hear?

00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:24.749 line:93%
Can anything you say be enough of an excuse?

00:56:56.648 --> 00:56:57.678 line:93%
A baby's bracelet?

00:57:00.588 --> 00:57:01.718 line:93%
How did he know?

00:57:11.858 --> 00:57:12.858 line:93%
Soo A.

00:57:13.729 --> 00:57:16.568 line:93%
It bothered me that I didn't buy you...

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:18.439 line:93%
any jewelry when you got married.

00:57:19.968 --> 00:57:22.909 line:93%
I'm sorry to give you this as I leave.

00:57:23.979 --> 00:57:26.878 line:93%
And there are times in life...

00:57:26.878 --> 00:57:28.979 line:93%
when you will fall.

00:57:29.749 --> 00:57:32.778 line:93%
The thing to stop you from falling completely...

00:57:33.019 --> 00:57:34.718 line:93%
can be your children.

00:57:36.459 --> 00:57:38.818 line:93%
If you are blessed with such a child,

00:57:39.459 --> 00:57:40.628 line:93%
give them this.

00:57:46.028 --> 00:57:47.068 line:93%
Dad...

00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:11.858 line:93%
Are you asleep?

00:58:20.068 --> 00:58:21.169 line:93%
Are you asleep?

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:23.968 line:93%
Yes, I am.

00:58:26.409 --> 00:58:27.769 line:93%
We need to talk.

00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:30.579 line:93%
Just go to sleep.

00:58:35.479 --> 00:58:37.318 line:93%
How can I sleep?

00:58:37.818 --> 00:58:39.378 line:93%
Do you think I can?

00:58:44.289 --> 00:58:45.419 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:58:48.159 --> 00:58:49.798 line:93%
I did everything wrong.

00:58:51.059 --> 00:58:52.428 line:93%
What did you do?

00:58:55.369 --> 00:58:58.738 line:93%
I cornered you and forced Ji An away.

00:59:01.139 --> 00:59:04.209 line:93%
I also got a restaurant in return.

00:59:07.278 --> 00:59:09.309 line:93%
And I didn't even know you were sick.

00:59:11.378 --> 00:59:12.579 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:59:15.988 --> 00:59:17.818 line:93%
I know how you feel now,

00:59:18.358 --> 00:59:20.289 line:93%
so will you do me a favor?

00:59:21.488 --> 00:59:22.488 line:93%
What?

00:59:24.099 --> 00:59:27.298 line:93%
Don't be a burden to the kids.

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:32.439 line:93%
Will you stop saying that? You're scaring me.

00:59:33.968 --> 00:59:36.068 line:93%
I can't live without you.

00:59:36.338 --> 00:59:37.909 line:93%
I can't live alone.

00:59:39.579 --> 00:59:40.948 line:93%
These days,

00:59:41.948 --> 00:59:43.718 line:93%
young people can barely...

00:59:44.419 --> 00:59:47.749 line:93%
raise kids without their parents' help.

00:59:49.218 --> 00:59:51.119 line:93%
You're perfectly capable of working,

00:59:51.619 --> 00:59:53.358 line:93%
so leeching off your kids...

00:59:54.488 --> 00:59:56.028 line:93%
is just wrong.

00:59:57.198 --> 00:59:58.229 line:93%
Honey.

01:00:06.539 --> 01:00:07.838 line:93%
Everyone...

01:00:08.369 --> 01:00:10.878 line:93%
dies at some point.

01:00:12.378 --> 01:00:15.249 line:93%
I'm sorry I didn't keep the promise that...

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.448 line:93%
I'd take good care of you,

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:21.619 line:93%
but a married couple thrives on trust.

01:00:22.148 --> 01:00:24.619 line:93%
It's not just about living together.

01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:30.499 line:93%
I've...

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:32.928 line:93%
settled everything.

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:36.229 line:93%
I'm ready to go.

01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:45.599 line:93%
I'm off to live alone.

01:01:46.298 --> 01:01:48.439 line:93%
You'll get a call in time.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.278 line:93%
Don't worry about me.

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.079 line:93%
Ji An. Ji Tae.

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:02.919 line:93%
What?

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:04.289 line:93%
Your dad's gone.

01:02:04.318 --> 01:02:05.758 line:93%
He left.

01:02:05.758 --> 01:02:06.758 line:93%
When?

01:02:07.028 --> 01:02:09.059 line:93%
Didn't you notice him leaving?

01:02:09.229 --> 01:02:11.999 line:93%
I stayed up until very late and dozed off.

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:13.298 line:93%
That's when he left.

01:02:13.298 --> 01:02:15.229 line:93%
Did he take all his things?

01:02:15.229 --> 01:02:16.999 line:93%
He took his guitar too.

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:19.198 line:93%
What should we do now?

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:21.108 line:93%
I should've slept by him.

01:02:21.568 --> 01:02:22.639 line:93%
I should've watched him.

01:02:24.409 --> 01:02:26.548 line:93%
The phone is turned off.

01:02:26.548 --> 01:02:29.749 line:93%
Please leave a message after the tone.

01:03:19.628 --> 01:03:20.628 line:93%
Seo Ji An.

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:25.068 line:93%
Were you in my room two nights ago?

01:03:28.008 --> 01:03:29.269 line:93%
Did you nurse me?

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.338 line:93%
I brought you some medicine...

01:03:32.338 --> 01:03:33.778 line:93%
since I thought you'd need them.

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:35.008 line:93%
Did you just leave that?

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.148 line:93%
You wiped me with a wet cloth.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.689 line:93%
You had a bad fever.

01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:42.088 line:93%
Why do you care? You shouldn't care...

01:03:42.088 --> 01:03:44.159 line:93%
if I have a fever or even die by that fever.

01:03:44.159 --> 01:03:45.358 line:93%
You shouldn't care.

01:03:45.358 --> 01:03:47.428 line:93%
I did it as a housemate.

01:03:47.428 --> 01:03:49.289 line:93%
If anyone else were to be sick like that,

01:03:49.289 --> 01:03:50.829 line:93%
I'd have done the same.

01:03:51.358 --> 01:03:52.559 line:93%
You forgot.

01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:55.499 line:93%
I hate it when others invade my personal space.

01:03:55.968 --> 01:03:57.838 line:93%
Why are you still here?

01:03:58.669 --> 01:03:59.709 line:93%
Are you asking...

01:04:00.669 --> 01:04:02.409 line:93%
why I haven't gone home yet?

01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:04.079 line:93%
Yes.

01:04:05.278 --> 01:04:07.409 line:93%
Who said I'll go home if I end it with you?

01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:11.878 line:93%
I told you.

01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:14.648 line:93%
My independence isn't just about you.

01:04:17.459 --> 01:04:19.758 line:93%
I won't go home until I can stand on my own.

01:04:21.159 --> 01:04:24.028 line:93%
Seo Ji An, it's not about you now.

01:04:42.608 --> 01:04:45.079 line:93%
Why is she a mess if she slept at home?

01:04:48.988 --> 01:04:50.718 line:93%
It looked like she cried.

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:56.128 line:93%
Mom, did you find Dad yet?

01:04:56.128 --> 01:04:57.698 line:93%
Not yet.

01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:00.798 line:93%
It's like he vanished into thin air or underground.

01:05:00.798 --> 01:05:02.669 line:93%
Then meet me at the hospital first.

01:06:09.968 --> 01:06:12.198 line:93%
Well, how are the results?

01:06:12.798 --> 01:06:15.369 line:93%
Seo Tae Soo doesn't have stomach cancer.

01:06:21.209 --> 01:06:24.079 line:93%
It's not cancer?

01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:27.818 line:93%
No. The biopsy results were negative.

01:06:27.988 --> 01:06:31.059 line:93%
Then how do you explain the vomiting,

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:32.619 line:93%
stomach aches, and blood?

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.088 line:93%
Well, there's something...

01:06:35.229 --> 01:06:38.358 line:93%
we call hypochondriasis.

01:06:38.358 --> 01:06:40.028 line:93%
People who worry too much...

01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:42.099 line:93%
that they might have cancer...

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:45.269 line:93%
sometimes show the exact same symptoms.

01:06:45.698 --> 01:06:47.639 line:93%
Hypochondriasis?

01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:50.678 line:93%
But in his case,

01:06:51.278 --> 01:06:52.479 line:93%
it's different.

01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:56.619 line:93%
It's an imaginary cancer.

01:06:58.019 --> 01:07:00.419 line:93%
Imaginary cancer?
