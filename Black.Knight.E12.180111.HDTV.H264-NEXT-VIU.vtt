4
00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.143
What's with her today?

5
00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:46.944
No idea.

6
00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:49.713
She found out I've been collecting newspapers.

7
00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:51.683
Then she asked me to bring all the newspapers...

8
00:00:51.683 --> 00:00:54.054
that date back 20 years ago.

9
00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:57.353
There is...

10
00:00:57.783 --> 00:00:59.624
a short article here.

14
00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.803
It's from October 21.

15
00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:15.033
Find me the newspaper from that day.

16
00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:17.943
And keep searching for any interviews he had.

17
00:01:18.404 --> 00:01:20.643
Why are you suddenly looking for a chemist?

18
00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:23.243
I need to come up with a story.

19
00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:25.743
What story?

20
00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:41.964
A story that can help me...

21
00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:45.064
permeate into his happy days.

25
00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:12.593
Where did you find these?

26
00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.363
I heard about the fire from Hae Ra's aunt,

27
00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:18.204
and I was quickly reminded of this.

28
00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:20.574
I know the lab very well too.

29
00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:21.873
That old building.

30
00:02:24.174 --> 00:02:25.273
What about these articles?

31
00:02:26.743 --> 00:02:30.544
A tailor at my shop is a huge collector.

32
00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.514
He collects newspapers, magazines, and stamps,

33
00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:36.014
so I asked him to find them.

34
00:02:38.884 --> 00:02:41.153
This feels so weird.

35
00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:45.623
You can read these on a computer in a library,

36
00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:47.963
but I thought you'd feel different...

37
00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:50.063
when you see it in real life.

38
00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:56.234
It's an article from a few months before the fire.

39
00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.243
Your dad is a very handsome man.

40
00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:05.813
You aren't that good looking...

41
00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:07.954
compared to him.

42
00:03:18.023 --> 00:03:19.264
Hi, Hae Ra.

43
00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:22.194
Hae Ra, take a look at this.

44
00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:25.903
What's so interesting here?

45
00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:28.034
It's my dad's old interview.

46
00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:34.014
Goodness, this is very old.

47
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.313
Do you remember him?

48
00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:39.213
I saw him a few times at home when I was a kid.

49
00:03:39.743 --> 00:03:40.754
Hae Ra.

50
00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.354
Go wash your hands.

51
00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:43.484
Let's eat dinner.

52
00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.824
Yes.

53
00:03:57.063 --> 00:03:58.734
Yes, it used to be a dorm.

54
00:03:59.463 --> 00:04:02.433
I heard it was built in 1880.

55
00:04:03.204 --> 00:04:05.803
It was completed in the spring of 1882.

56
00:04:06.303 --> 00:04:07.813
The construction took a while...

57
00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:09.174
because the winter was long and harsh.

58
00:04:09.174 --> 00:04:11.183
It sounds like you built it yourself.

59
00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:13.613
How do you remember that in such detail?

60
00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:15.854
My grandma's house was nearby,

61
00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:17.284
so I hung out there often.

62
00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:19.183
That's when I heard about these.

63
00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:21.854
Did you go over to the lab often?

64
00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:24.024
We let kids come over during the weekends,

65
00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:26.294
and we had a lot of programs for them too.

66
00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:28.734
In autumn, we washed blankets as an experiment.

67
00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:30.703
How do you remember that?

68
00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:34.573
My grandma was on the blue team.

69
00:04:35.404 --> 00:04:36.503
What's that?

70
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:39.274
The entire town gathered together...

71
00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:41.113
to see which side gets whiter blankets.

72
00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:42.474
We were separated to blue team and white team.

73
00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:45.243
That was like a festival for the town.

74
00:04:45.683 --> 00:04:47.714
Your dad was such a wonderful man.

75
00:04:50.284 --> 00:04:52.484
Have you ever been to my dad's lab?

76
00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.323
No, I've only heard about it from Dad.

77
00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:56.594
I've never been there.

78
00:04:57.724 --> 00:04:58.993
I'm so sorry.

79
00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:02.863
You don't have any memory of Mr. Moon's happy days.

80
00:05:06.563 --> 00:05:07.573
You're right.

81
00:05:09.674 --> 00:05:11.344
You look very happy today.

82
00:05:12.474 --> 00:05:14.174
I've been happy ever since I met you.

83
00:05:16.443 --> 00:05:18.414
My gosh.

84
00:05:18.414 --> 00:05:20.013
Hae Ra, you must be happy.

85
00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:22.883
Aunt Sook Hee, how's the food?

86
00:05:22.883 --> 00:05:24.424
You are a good cook,

87
00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:26.084
unlike how you look.

88
00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:28.524
You haven't even seen what I can do.

89
00:05:30.024 --> 00:05:32.263
I want another egg omelet.

90
00:05:32.263 --> 00:05:33.263
Okay.

91
00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:34.964
Have some.

92
00:05:45.873 --> 00:05:47.013
My gosh.

93
00:05:49.544 --> 00:05:52.844
Why on earth did she make me get these books?

94
00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:54.484
(Storytelling Methods)

95
00:05:58.683 --> 00:06:00.354
It's not like she's writing a movie script.

96
00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:03.363
(Writing a Movie Script)

97
00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:09.363
The lab caught on fire...

98
00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:10.763
when you two were very young, right?

99
00:06:12.363 --> 00:06:13.474
I got my coat tailored back then,

100
00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.174
so I wasn't too young.

101
00:06:15.404 --> 00:06:16.433
I was about 14.

102
00:06:16.974 --> 00:06:19.904
That means she was probably in her 20s.

103
00:06:19.904 --> 00:06:21.573
Why does she talk as if she was a kid...

104
00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:23.073
who went to visit her grandma?

105
00:06:26.714 --> 00:06:27.854
That's very odd.

106
00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:46.003
I lost my parents and grew up with my grandma,

107
00:06:46.563 --> 00:06:48.474
so I understand your sorrow.

108
00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:53.914
The lab caught on fire because of short circuit,

109
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:54.974
because the building was too old, right?

110
00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:56.513
That was the conclusion.

111
00:06:57.943 --> 00:06:59.613
You must've been very sad.

112
00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:06.084
Do you remember anything in particular...

113
00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.894
around the time of that fire?

114
00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:11.224
Like what?

115
00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:12.894
Something...

116
00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:17.133
that seemed out of the ordinary.

117
00:07:19.203 --> 00:07:20.774
I do remember something.

118
00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.404
I need to keep making up my story...

119
00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:27.544
to keep him interested in me.

120
00:07:30.243 --> 00:07:33.584
I think I've seen a couple of strange guys.

121
00:07:36.453 --> 00:07:37.724
Strange guys.

122
00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:39.553
That's pretty vague.

123
00:07:39.823 --> 00:07:41.193
They didn't seem like...

124
00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:43.394
anyone from the lab or from the neighborhood.

125
00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:45.724
I remembered them as we talked.

126
00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:47.063
Give me one second.

127
00:07:53.503 --> 00:07:56.034
Have you ever seen this person?

128
00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:01.914
I'm not sure.

129
00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:04.214
He doesn't seem very friendly.

130
00:08:05.344 --> 00:08:06.414
Who is it?

131
00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:08.683
Is he someone who's involved with the fire?

132
00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:11.924
I think so.

133
00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:13.253
But we'll never know.

134
00:08:25.904 --> 00:08:27.904
I said I'll do the dishes after I send an email.

135
00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:29.503
The machine did everything.

136
00:08:29.503 --> 00:08:30.844
Don't worry.

137
00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.274
I'll get washed up.

138
00:08:32.274 --> 00:08:33.374
Goodnight.

139
00:08:41.014 --> 00:08:43.323
I'm sorry we only talked about the old times.

140
00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:44.953
No, I liked it.

141
00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:48.353
And we decided to try hard for a month.

142
00:08:48.553 --> 00:08:50.364
Let's eat dinner with her often,

143
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:51.764
and talk a lot with her.

144
00:08:57.034 --> 00:08:59.303
When will the personal trainer be here again?

145
00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.233
I'd like to work out too.

146
00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.404
We won't work out at home anymore.

147
00:09:04.404 --> 00:09:05.473
Why not?

148
00:09:05.904 --> 00:09:07.973
He seemed like a good trainer.

149
00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.544
He wasn't that good actually.

150
00:09:13.713 --> 00:09:15.014
Too bad.

151
00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:17.223
I was looking forward to working out at home.

152
00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:20.953
Your bed will arrive the day after tomorrow.

153
00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:22.693
That's okay.

154
00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:25.264
Can I bring my bedding tomorrow?

155
00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.264
Of course.

156
00:09:59.864 --> 00:10:01.634
Why isn't he coming out for water?

157
00:10:14.343 --> 00:10:16.514
- Gosh! - Goodness!

158
00:10:20.114 --> 00:10:21.483
You scared me.

159
00:10:21.614 --> 00:10:23.483
What are you doing here?

160
00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:26.894
I'm thinking about what to make for breakfast.

161
00:10:28.254 --> 00:10:30.264
Why are you thinking about that out here?

162
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.664
Since this is the kitchen where I'll be cooking it.

163
00:10:33.864 --> 00:10:35.693
I'll cook breakfast for you tomorrow.

164
00:10:35.693 --> 00:10:36.963
So you can go bed.

165
00:10:37.933 --> 00:10:39.463
Why did you glare at me...

166
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:41.933
when I mentioned the home training?

167
00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.813
There's nothing between him and me.

168
00:10:48.073 --> 00:10:49.414
Then why are you avoiding him?

169
00:10:49.674 --> 00:10:51.483
I'm not avoiding him.

170
00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:54.583
I just want to focus on the man I like.

171
00:10:56.553 --> 00:10:57.784
And who could that be?

172
00:10:58.453 --> 00:11:00.593
My first love, Moon Soo Ho.

173
00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.723
I really, really like...

174
00:11:02.723 --> 00:11:03.963
Are you here to get water?

175
00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:10.463
No, a facial mask.

176
00:11:10.463 --> 00:11:11.803
My office is too dry.

177
00:11:11.803 --> 00:11:13.164
I need to put one on my face at night.

178
00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:15.034
Give me one too.

179
00:11:16.103 --> 00:11:17.443
This is the last one.

180
00:11:20.544 --> 00:11:22.213
You're young, so you don't need it.

181
00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:30.154
That crazy...

182
00:11:38.424 --> 00:11:40.093
Good Morning Korea.

183
00:11:40.093 --> 00:11:43.333
Today, we have a charming businessman in the studio.

184
00:11:43.404 --> 00:11:45.504
A med school graduate from the US...

185
00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.603
turned himself into a businessman.

186
00:11:47.603 --> 00:11:50.144
He's trying to stop reckless development,

187
00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:52.703
and he is leading a movement...

188
00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:54.874
that preserves old neighborhoods.

189
00:11:54.874 --> 00:11:56.414
It's the CEO of Blacksmith's...

190
00:11:56.414 --> 00:11:57.614
Moon Soo Ho.

191
00:11:57.614 --> 00:11:58.683
Welcome.

192
00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:00.053
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

193
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.284
It's nice to meet you too.

194
00:12:01.284 --> 00:12:03.384
I'm meeting you for the first time,

195
00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:05.784
and two things surprised me about you.

196
00:12:05.784 --> 00:12:07.853
I didn't think someone who'd want to preserve...

197
00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:09.223
neighborhoods to be so young...

198
00:12:09.223 --> 00:12:11.193
and so handsome.

199
00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:12.894
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

200
00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.794
I'm going to ask you...

201
00:12:14.794 --> 00:12:17.664
what the viewers want to know.

202
00:12:17.933 --> 00:12:20.134
What made you start...

203
00:12:20.134 --> 00:12:21.374
the city revival project?

204
00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:24.004
I wanted to protect the neighborhood...

205
00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:25.803
I grew up in.

206
00:12:25.803 --> 00:12:27.544
Also the ordeal I experienced as a child...

207
00:12:27.544 --> 00:12:29.343
was the reason to start the project.

208
00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:35.014
People even wrote petitions...

209
00:12:35.014 --> 00:12:37.223
to preserve the lab building,

210
00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.953
but the lab was burned down...

211
00:12:38.953 --> 00:12:42.024
and my father died in the fire.

212
00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:47.164
Since the lab dealt with chemicals,

213
00:12:47.164 --> 00:12:49.494
they had thorough monthly checkups.

214
00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:52.664
I think the fire wasn't caused by a short circuit.

215
00:12:52.963 --> 00:12:54.433
I believe those who'd benefit from...

216
00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:56.174
demolishing the lab did it.

217
00:12:57.073 --> 00:12:58.404
Was he...

218
00:12:59.303 --> 00:13:00.713
the son of deceased Dr. Moon?

219
00:13:02.744 --> 00:13:05.514
As I proceed with the city revival project,

220
00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:06.853
I'm going to request...

221
00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:09.053
the police to reinvestigate this case.

222
00:13:10.453 --> 00:13:13.424
Reinvestigation will be possible only if...

223
00:13:13.424 --> 00:13:15.294
there's new evidence or witness.

224
00:13:15.553 --> 00:13:16.963
Of course there is.

225
00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:18.563
You seem to have conviction.

226
00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:21.463
Since you mentioned it publicly on air,

227
00:13:21.463 --> 00:13:23.904
I'm sure the viewers will show...

228
00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.664
more interest.

229
00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:26.874
I hope so.

230
00:13:27.303 --> 00:13:29.404
I want the places with our memories...

231
00:13:29.404 --> 00:13:30.943
and histories to be preserved.

232
00:13:32.703 --> 00:13:34.473
The police is very busy.

233
00:13:34.473 --> 00:13:36.544
They won't reinvestigate that case.

234
00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:38.343
Evidence. Witness.

235
00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:41.583
What could that be?

236
00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:44.583
There's nothing to worry about.

237
00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:47.193
Let's look at Geumseong-dong...

238
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.924
which has been called the village of...

239
00:13:49.924 --> 00:13:51.563
persimmon trees since Joseon Dynasty.

240
00:13:52.424 --> 00:13:55.034
Thank you so much for being here.

241
00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.833
You were great on the show.

242
00:13:56.833 --> 00:13:58.233
- Thank you. - Thank you.

243
00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:00.634
Mr. Moon.

244
00:14:00.634 --> 00:14:03.004
You spoke so eloquently when it went live.

245
00:14:03.404 --> 00:14:06.103
Shall we have breakfast before going to work?

246
00:14:06.573 --> 00:14:08.114
You should go ahead without me.

247
00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.144
I have things to take care of.

248
00:14:11.144 --> 00:14:12.183
Okay.

249
00:14:12.183 --> 00:14:13.583
- Let's go. - All right.

250
00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:26.394
I was going to do that for you.

251
00:14:26.593 --> 00:14:28.764
Do you want coffee? Black?

252
00:14:29.864 --> 00:14:32.034
You remembered. Black coffee.

253
00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:39.103
Were you out this morning?

254
00:14:39.103 --> 00:14:41.374
Yes, I had something to do.

255
00:14:41.674 --> 00:14:43.343
Why didn't you go straight to work?

256
00:14:44.614 --> 00:14:46.213
I came back to make Hae Ra's breakfast.

257
00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.453
She should be out here now.

258
00:14:52.323 --> 00:14:54.494
Stop talking about that girl.

259
00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:57.823
It's only the two of us here.

260
00:14:59.994 --> 00:15:02.563
I want to live with you like this.

261
00:15:06.164 --> 00:15:08.674
Thanks for making Hae Ra's clothes beautifully.

262
00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:10.103
Please make some more...

263
00:15:10.103 --> 00:15:11.874
with nice fabric.

264
00:15:12.943 --> 00:15:15.244
Thanks for supporting Sharon Tailor.

265
00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:19.514
Come watch the news.

266
00:15:27.223 --> 00:15:29.754
Neighborhoods for the city revival...

267
00:15:29.754 --> 00:15:32.494
pilot project will be determined this month.

268
00:15:32.693 --> 00:15:34.264
Hyunmi-dong in Mapo-gu,

269
00:15:34.264 --> 00:15:36.134
and Geumseong-dong in Jongno-gu...

270
00:15:36.134 --> 00:15:37.933
are strong contenders.

271
00:15:37.933 --> 00:15:39.063
That's good news, right?

272
00:15:39.364 --> 00:15:41.134
The final result has to come out.

273
00:15:41.134 --> 00:15:43.473
It could turn into a speculation zone.

274
00:15:43.473 --> 00:15:44.644
Exactly.

275
00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.443
People will want to...

276
00:15:46.443 --> 00:15:48.514
buy property in that neighborhood.

277
00:15:49.213 --> 00:15:50.914
Still, it makes me happy.

278
00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:53.953
Thank you.

279
00:15:55.453 --> 00:15:57.953
You were great in the show this morning.

280
00:15:57.953 --> 00:16:00.494
How did you watch it? You always sleep in.

281
00:16:00.654 --> 00:16:03.723
My boss told me to watch it, so I did.

282
00:16:03.723 --> 00:16:04.823
You looked great on camera.

283
00:16:04.823 --> 00:16:06.164
You could be an actor.

284
00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:08.164
- Really? - I'm kidding.

285
00:16:08.994 --> 00:16:10.404
I have to go to work.

286
00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:11.933
- Already? - Yes.

287
00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:13.973
I have to be a porter all day.

288
00:16:14.134 --> 00:16:15.904
I'll see you in the evening.

289
00:16:16.473 --> 00:16:17.544
Bye.

290
00:16:20.343 --> 00:16:21.573
You'll trip.

291
00:16:21.573 --> 00:16:22.813
No, I won't.

292
00:16:22.813 --> 00:16:24.914
Why didn't you tell me?

293
00:16:24.914 --> 00:16:26.144
I feel a bit left out.

294
00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:30.083
I was on for just a minute or two.

295
00:16:31.524 --> 00:16:33.223
Are you free for dinner tonight?

296
00:16:33.524 --> 00:16:34.924
Would you like to...

297
00:16:34.924 --> 00:16:36.494
talk about business over dinner?

298
00:16:36.994 --> 00:16:38.424
Couldn't we talk at home?

299
00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.693
I like talking business outside...

300
00:16:40.693 --> 00:16:42.794
dressed up and in my heels.

301
00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:45.233
Okay, then.

302
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.274
I'll reserve a restaurant and let you know.

303
00:16:58.313 --> 00:17:00.014
What if...

304
00:17:00.014 --> 00:17:01.284
Geumseong-dong gets chosen?

305
00:17:02.614 --> 00:17:04.783
I'll do some talking, and it'll become...

306
00:17:04.783 --> 00:17:06.223
a speculation-ridden area.

307
00:17:06.223 --> 00:17:07.693
Then it'll be canceled...

308
00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.924
because it won't be suited for the project.

309
00:17:09.924 --> 00:17:11.564
The project is run by the city.

310
00:17:12.124 --> 00:17:14.193
Don't do anything weird. You'll be in trouble.

311
00:17:14.193 --> 00:17:16.493
You're so timid.

312
00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:18.733
Hand over Yoon Dal Hong's...

313
00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:20.134
surface rights to someone else.

314
00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:23.344
No. I got that on my own.

315
00:17:23.344 --> 00:17:25.844
- What? - Father, don't worry.

316
00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:28.144
I'm sure there's a good reason...

317
00:17:28.144 --> 00:17:29.344
for Gon being stubborn.

318
00:17:29.344 --> 00:17:31.314
You shouldn't trust the people...

319
00:17:31.314 --> 00:17:32.943
you bribed too much.

320
00:17:33.144 --> 00:17:35.154
A lot of their children...

321
00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:36.854
studied abroad.

322
00:17:37.384 --> 00:17:39.523
And Moon Soo Ho gave them the opportunity.

323
00:17:39.523 --> 00:17:40.523
What?

324
00:17:40.523 --> 00:17:42.293
He's really meticulous.

325
00:17:42.293 --> 00:17:43.324
Some became...

326
00:17:43.324 --> 00:17:45.394
his company employees.

327
00:17:46.124 --> 00:17:48.334
Don't think you know everything.

328
00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:50.463
I don't trust you.

329
00:17:50.763 --> 00:17:51.834
From now on,

330
00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:54.634
make decisions after getting my permission.

331
00:17:54.634 --> 00:17:55.634
I don't want to.

332
00:17:58.144 --> 00:18:00.174
And don't force Young Mi...

333
00:18:00.174 --> 00:18:02.144
to come here for breakfast.

334
00:18:02.743 --> 00:18:04.213
She didn't do anything wrong.

335
00:18:05.483 --> 00:18:08.213
No, I love having breakfast here.

336
00:18:10.983 --> 00:18:13.394
That insolent boy.

337
00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.894
You're too naive...

338
00:18:19.894 --> 00:18:21.634
because you grew up wealthy.

339
00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:22.634
Is it so hard...

340
00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:24.334
to just go with...

341
00:18:24.334 --> 00:18:25.763
your dad's opinion?

342
00:18:25.763 --> 00:18:27.433
He never listens.

343
00:18:28.134 --> 00:18:29.604
Leave your dad up to me.

344
00:18:29.604 --> 00:18:31.074
I'll try to convince him.

345
00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:32.844
You're trying so hard.

346
00:18:35.074 --> 00:18:36.983
I'm the best girlfriend you can have.

347
00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:38.584
Consider yourself lucky.

348
00:18:39.144 --> 00:18:40.914
Okay. I get it. You can go now.

349
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.283
Aren't you going to work?

350
00:18:46.324 --> 00:18:47.493
Do you want to break up?

351
00:18:50.523 --> 00:18:52.293
What are you talking about in the morning?

352
00:18:52.723 --> 00:18:54.164
You don't adore me.

353
00:18:54.164 --> 00:18:55.564
You don't like me either.

354
00:18:55.993 --> 00:18:57.634
Do you remember when our last kiss was?

355
00:19:05.674 --> 00:19:07.074
Don't do it like it's homework.

356
00:19:08.243 --> 00:19:10.344
Please don't add another trouble.

357
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.084
You shouldn't do this to me.

358
00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:14.554
You don't know what I have.

359
00:19:15.683 --> 00:19:17.084
For you, I...

360
00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:18.523
What?

361
00:19:22.523 --> 00:19:24.564
I'm so good to you.

362
00:19:24.924 --> 00:19:26.193
Consider yourself lucky.

363
00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:14.344
The ring went back to its owner.

364
00:20:15.374 --> 00:20:18.483
So why won't these letters disappear?

365
00:20:21.213 --> 00:20:22.414
Jeom Bok...

366
00:20:23.683 --> 00:20:25.723
might have the answer.

367
00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:32.324
(Blacksmith's)

368
00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:39.634
Hello.

369
00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:42.273
What a nice office.

370
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.513
I didn't know we had an appointment.

371
00:20:48.844 --> 00:20:50.884
I wanted to say I enjoyed the show,

372
00:20:51.614 --> 00:20:53.043
and I wanted to talk about the past too.

373
00:20:56.414 --> 00:20:57.854
I'm here to confess.

374
00:21:00.193 --> 00:21:01.193
Have a seat.

375
00:21:10.933 --> 00:21:12.003
I know...

376
00:21:13.164 --> 00:21:14.703
you're suspecting my father.

377
00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:17.104
I don't know what you're about to say,

378
00:21:17.243 --> 00:21:19.174
but whether I believe it or not is up to me.

379
00:21:21.414 --> 00:21:23.584
I think he was at the lab when it caught on fire.

380
00:21:25.443 --> 00:21:27.713
He was drunk and told me about it once.

381
00:21:28.753 --> 00:21:30.023
He said he was there,

382
00:21:32.654 --> 00:21:33.824
crying.

383
00:21:37.594 --> 00:21:39.693
As he went in and out of the lab,

384
00:21:39.693 --> 00:21:42.433
he often sneaked out some drugs to sell.

385
00:21:42.894 --> 00:21:46.003
He sneaked out alcohol, glycerine, and stuff...

386
00:21:46.433 --> 00:21:48.473
to sell them to small hospitals and pharmacies.

387
00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.574
He was there to steal drugs as well that day?

388
00:21:52.174 --> 00:21:53.473
He was in the storage...

389
00:21:53.914 --> 00:21:55.874
and ran out when he heard the explosion.

390
00:21:58.144 --> 00:22:00.054
He ran into Doctor Moon's son.

391
00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:03.453
He ran away because he was ashamed.

392
00:22:09.223 --> 00:22:11.424
Why are you telling me this here?

393
00:22:11.624 --> 00:22:13.693
Because he won't be able to say this.

394
00:22:14.693 --> 00:22:16.094
Misunderstandings will get bigger.

395
00:22:18.404 --> 00:22:19.973
I'm starting to like you.

396
00:22:21.003 --> 00:22:22.273
You're a good son.

397
00:22:22.533 --> 00:22:23.904
He's a poor man.

398
00:22:25.604 --> 00:22:26.773
Please forgive him.

399
00:22:27.773 --> 00:22:30.043
I'm already aware of his stealing.

400
00:22:30.043 --> 00:22:31.943
Well, I didn't slack off until now.

401
00:22:33.513 --> 00:22:34.914
I guess...

402
00:22:35.384 --> 00:22:37.384
I know what you don't know.

403
00:22:37.384 --> 00:22:38.554
What is that?

404
00:22:39.283 --> 00:22:41.154
I'll let you hear it in public.

405
00:22:41.154 --> 00:22:42.753
I have to go meet someone now.

406
00:22:48.164 --> 00:22:49.364
Thank you for your time.

407
00:23:01.144 --> 00:23:02.344
(Sammi Trading)

408
00:23:02.543 --> 00:23:04.743
Excuse me. Let me through.

409
00:23:04.914 --> 00:23:06.114
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:06.114 --> 00:23:08.753
I'm sorry. Goodness, sorry.

411
00:23:10.523 --> 00:23:13.084
Oh, no. Please hold for me.

412
00:23:14.054 --> 00:23:15.493
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:17.193 --> 00:23:18.424
Thank you.

414
00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.664
Thank you.

415
00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:23.094
Gosh, I'm sorry.

416
00:23:24.364 --> 00:23:25.634
How could they tell us...

417
00:23:25.634 --> 00:23:27.804
to change items at dawn all of a sudden?

418
00:23:27.933 --> 00:23:30.074
Give me the wet tissues. I'll divide them.

419
00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:32.674
Will you? All right, here.

420
00:23:32.904 --> 00:23:33.973
Oh, Hae Ra.

421
00:23:34.243 --> 00:23:35.574
Did you know that Mr. Moon...

422
00:23:35.574 --> 00:23:38.183
asked for reinvestigation to the police?

423
00:23:38.713 --> 00:23:41.013
No, I found it out today.

424
00:23:42.283 --> 00:23:44.783
He seemed to be born rich, but he had his suffering.

425
00:23:45.453 --> 00:23:48.693
Is he usually dark and depressed?

426
00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:50.664
Not at all.

427
00:23:51.164 --> 00:23:52.693
He's fun to be with. He likes making jokes too.

428
00:23:52.693 --> 00:23:55.533
Mr. Moon is cool.

429
00:23:55.533 --> 00:23:56.604
He is.

430
00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:00.374
- Hey. - Hello.

431
00:24:00.374 --> 00:24:01.574
- Hello. - Hi.

432
00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:02.574
They want us to take out digestive pills...

433
00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.773
and put in multi-vitamins each.

434
00:24:05.674 --> 00:24:08.543
We're almost done here, so how can you say that now?

435
00:24:10.043 --> 00:24:11.543
Stop complaining and do it already.

436
00:24:12.614 --> 00:24:14.283
You know we go on tour around the town, right?

437
00:24:15.384 --> 00:24:16.483
We have an hour left.

438
00:24:16.654 --> 00:24:18.624
We can't finish this before then.

439
00:24:18.953 --> 00:24:21.124
Right, you don't have time.

440
00:24:21.124 --> 00:24:23.523
So work hard.

441
00:24:24.594 --> 00:24:25.594
Thanks, guys.

442
00:24:29.564 --> 00:24:30.703
Goodness.

443
00:24:30.963 --> 00:24:31.963
"Thanks, guys."

444
00:24:33.604 --> 00:24:34.604
Take them out.

445
00:24:34.604 --> 00:24:36.033
- Take them out. - We were almost done.

446
00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:37.374
Darn it.

447
00:24:38.404 --> 00:24:40.043
We're meeting in an hour.

448
00:24:40.174 --> 00:24:42.144
Can I act like I'm close to you later?

449
00:24:43.713 --> 00:24:45.584
(Can I act like I'm close to you later?)

450
00:24:46.243 --> 00:24:48.084
No, you can't.

451
00:24:52.354 --> 00:24:54.293
(Then just remember this.)

452
00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.894
Then just remember this.

453
00:24:58.523 --> 00:25:00.433
Red bean bread means "I love you."

454
00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:02.033
Cream bread means "Kiss me."

455
00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:04.104
Baguette means "Come to emergency stairs."

456
00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:06.463
What is he saying?

457
00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:11.874
Don't get them mixed up.

458
00:25:11.874 --> 00:25:13.203
- Okay. - Okay.

459
00:25:13.414 --> 00:25:16.273
- Try our bread. - Hello.

460
00:25:16.273 --> 00:25:19.043
- Try some of our bread. - Try some.

461
00:25:19.043 --> 00:25:22.013
- Come try some. - It might make you faint.

462
00:25:22.013 --> 00:25:23.183
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

463
00:25:23.183 --> 00:25:25.424
- It's organic flour. - Thank you.

464
00:25:26.054 --> 00:25:27.154
You get 10 percent discount...

465
00:25:27.154 --> 00:25:29.693
if you buy our bread before 3pm.

466
00:25:32.993 --> 00:25:35.864
Your cream bread is the best in Korea.

467
00:25:35.864 --> 00:25:37.763
We'll do our best to protect your bakery.

468
00:25:37.763 --> 00:25:39.233
Thank you.

469
00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:40.533
Please bake delicious breads.

470
00:25:40.533 --> 00:25:41.604
Don't you worry.

471
00:25:45.904 --> 00:25:46.914
Thank you.

472
00:25:46.914 --> 00:25:48.243
It's going so well.

473
00:25:48.243 --> 00:25:49.814
Please prepare one more tray of these.

474
00:25:50.443 --> 00:25:52.084
Here's red bean bread.

475
00:25:52.443 --> 00:25:53.453
Red bean bread.

476
00:25:54.983 --> 00:25:56.624
Red bean bread means "I love you."

477
00:25:57.154 --> 00:25:58.283
You know what red bean bread is, right?

478
00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:01.324
Yes, red bean bread to you too.

479
00:26:02.354 --> 00:26:04.824
I'll go get a new tray of bread.

480
00:26:06.834 --> 00:26:08.263
Now is cream bread.

481
00:26:08.263 --> 00:26:10.033
Cream bread means "Kiss me."

482
00:26:11.233 --> 00:26:12.304
Don't you know what it is?

483
00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:16.334
Here's cream bread.

484
00:26:16.973 --> 00:26:18.074
I got more cream bread.

485
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:22.914
Goodness.

486
00:26:24.243 --> 00:26:26.213
Bring us some more cream bread.

487
00:26:26.783 --> 00:26:28.084
It's sweet, right?

488
00:26:28.084 --> 00:26:30.683
All right, give us some more cream bread.

489
00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:32.253
Cream bread.

490
00:26:34.023 --> 00:26:35.023
Goodness.

491
00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:40.433
One more cream bread.

492
00:26:43.533 --> 00:26:45.804
Well, red bean bread for me.

493
00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:46.874
Red bean bread.

494
00:26:48.104 --> 00:26:51.374
Using social media is the best marketing method.

495
00:26:51.374 --> 00:26:53.814
Please stop saying obvious stuff.

496
00:26:53.814 --> 00:26:57.013
All right, gather in.

497
00:26:57.183 --> 00:26:59.713
Gather tight.

498
00:26:59.713 --> 00:27:01.884
- I'll take it now. - Oh, well...

499
00:27:01.884 --> 00:27:03.554
Let's say "red bean bread" after the count of three.

500
00:27:03.554 --> 00:27:04.683
Good idea.

501
00:27:04.683 --> 00:27:06.523
I'll count to three then.

502
00:27:06.523 --> 00:27:08.523
In 1, 2, 3.

503
00:27:08.523 --> 00:27:10.824
- Red bean bread. - Red bean bread.

504
00:27:17.604 --> 00:27:19.304
What do you mean?

505
00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:20.473
I don't understand.

506
00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:22.203
I'm really sorry,

507
00:27:22.203 --> 00:27:25.344
but let me cancel this contract.

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:27.674
Did Moon Soo Ho threaten you?

509
00:27:27.674 --> 00:27:30.543
No, I didn't even call him.

510
00:27:31.243 --> 00:27:32.783
Do you need more money?

511
00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:36.554
I feel like...

512
00:27:37.253 --> 00:27:39.884
my son was injured because of me.

513
00:27:39.884 --> 00:27:42.753
He regained consciousness and is recovering.

514
00:27:42.753 --> 00:27:45.963
He still can't feel his left arm.

515
00:27:47.134 --> 00:27:49.433
Only if I hadn't betrayed Mr. Moon...

516
00:27:50.933 --> 00:27:52.963
I think I'm getting punished.

517
00:27:56.604 --> 00:27:58.003
All right then.

518
00:27:58.543 --> 00:28:00.273
The cancellation penalty is three times the amount.

519
00:28:01.644 --> 00:28:02.743
Will you be okay with that?

Sharon?

531
00:29:34.304 --> 00:29:35.804
Where have you been?

532
00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.804
I went to deliver some blankets.

533
00:29:37.844 --> 00:29:39.344
- Blankets? - Yes.

534
00:29:39.804 --> 00:29:41.473
Sharon is staying...

535
00:29:41.473 --> 00:29:43.683
somewhere else for a month.

536
00:29:45.084 --> 00:29:46.384
Where is that?

537
00:29:49.953 --> 00:29:50.953
Sharon.

538
00:29:52.054 --> 00:29:53.054
Sharon.

Goodness, what brings you here?

00:29:55.594 --> 00:29:56.963
Where's her room?

541
00:29:57.564 --> 00:29:59.424

What's with you?

00:30:44.604 --> 00:30:46.943
What are you doing here?

554
00:30:48.443 --> 00:30:50.144
I wanted to live under the same roof...

555
00:30:50.144 --> 00:30:51.314
with my husband.

556
00:30:51.314 --> 00:30:52.584
Get out of there right now.

557
00:31:02.824 --> 00:31:03.924
I'm living there for a month...

558
00:31:03.924 --> 00:31:05.624
while we get construction work done.

Seung Goo.

560
00:31:09.164 --> 00:31:10.763
Are you doing construction work here?

561
00:31:11.834 --> 00:31:12.864
No.

562
00:31:17.574 --> 00:31:19.074
I've been longing for him for over 200 years.

563
00:31:19.074 --> 00:31:20.344
Can't I just have a month?

564
00:31:20.344 --> 00:31:22.414
I just want to stay around him.

565
00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:24.914
The story is about to get unfolded.

566
00:31:25.614 --> 00:31:27.013
You can't do this.

567
00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:28.713
What do you mean?

568
00:31:29.614 --> 00:31:30.983
I saw Jeom Bok.

569
00:31:32.154 --> 00:31:33.253
Jeom Bok?

570
00:31:34.453 --> 00:31:36.453
The same Jeom Bok who used to draw well?

571
00:31:36.624 --> 00:31:37.993
It was definitely him.

572
00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:40.594
He rushed by me...

573
00:31:40.864 --> 00:31:42.533
on a bicycle.

574
00:31:43.834 --> 00:31:45.334
The gray-haired old man did that?

575
00:31:46.773 --> 00:31:48.104
He got younger.

576
00:31:48.304 --> 00:31:49.634
And his mole was gone.

577
00:31:51.003 --> 00:31:52.443
How can that be?

578
00:31:53.874 --> 00:31:55.043
Last time I saw him,

579
00:31:55.043 --> 00:31:56.884
he was definitely an old man.

580
00:31:57.144 --> 00:31:58.543
It was him.

581
00:31:58.844 --> 00:32:01.614
His jacket also had the letters "JB".

582
00:32:03.183 --> 00:32:04.824
What JB?

583
00:32:04.824 --> 00:32:06.183
I'm sure there's a way...

584
00:32:06.183 --> 00:32:07.753
to erase the ghost letters.

585
00:32:07.753 --> 00:32:09.293
I know he was good at drawing,

586
00:32:09.293 --> 00:32:10.594
but how can he erase that?

587
00:32:12.023 --> 00:32:13.463
Anyway, that's that.

588
00:32:13.894 --> 00:32:15.094
I doubt we are...

589
00:32:15.094 --> 00:32:17.064
the only two who's like this on earth.

590
00:32:19.503 --> 00:32:20.604
Get out of that house.

591
00:32:20.604 --> 00:32:21.703
I'll be out in a month.

592
00:32:21.703 --> 00:32:23.033
Get out right now.

593
00:32:23.033 --> 00:32:25.304
I want to resolve this deep sorrow.

594
00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:28.574
You're also responsible for making me like this.

595
00:32:30.144 --> 00:32:32.283
Will you let me have just this one?

596
00:32:34.783 --> 00:32:36.384
I won't do anything.

597
00:32:37.154 --> 00:32:39.283
I'll just be with him and then move out.

598
00:32:40.253 --> 00:32:41.523
I mean it.

599
00:32:47.733 --> 00:32:49.933
Then let's start looking for Jeom Bok together.

600

Seung Goo.

601
00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:58.904
Let's have a cup of strong and sweet coffee.

602
00:32:59.374 --> 00:33:00.543
I'll boil some water.

603
00:33:10.953 --> 00:33:12.654
Here they are.

604
00:33:13.223 --> 00:33:14.253
Okay.

605
00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:15.894
And this one.

Are these everything?

608
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:21.594
There are 120 more in the small conference room.

609
00:33:22.164 --> 00:33:24.233
Oh, we're almost done.

610
00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:26.973
Mr. Moon, you are such a smart guy.

611
00:33:26.973 --> 00:33:28.473
You're always right down to the point...

612
00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:29.973
just like me.

613
00:33:30.374 --> 00:33:33.144
It felt like our ideas suddenly became a reality.

614
00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.943
You were as clear as noonday.

615
00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:36.614
You know that you're having some tea...

616
00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:37.614
with our chairman, right?

617
00:33:37.614 --> 00:33:38.614
Right.

618
00:33:39.144 --> 00:33:40.213
Okay.

619
00:33:40.483 --> 00:33:41.614
I know that.

620
00:33:41.614 --> 00:33:42.983
Then let's get moving.

621
00:33:42.983 --> 00:33:44.253
Yes, this way.

622
00:33:45.084 --> 00:33:47.554
Let's see. This one goes here.

623
00:33:49.554 --> 00:33:51.293
It looks like he's seeing the chairman.

624
00:33:53.334 --> 00:33:54.634
Let's move the boxes in the small conference room.

625
00:33:54.634 --> 00:33:55.693
Okay.

626
00:33:57.064 --> 00:33:58.233
Ms. Jung.

627
00:33:59.503 --> 00:34:01.304
Can you get those baguettes earlier?

628
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:06.644
Did we have baguettes?

629
00:34:07.273 --> 00:34:09.213
Baguette means "Come to emergency stairs."

630
00:34:14.913 --> 00:34:16.654
Those looked heavy. Are you okay?

631
00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:18.983
Of course. That's nothing.

632
00:34:22.793 --> 00:34:24.764
I told you to stop doing cream bread in public.

633
00:34:24.764 --> 00:34:25.864
It's too dangerous.

634
00:34:28.293 --> 00:34:29.793
I have a dinner appointment tonight.

635
00:34:29.793 --> 00:34:31.663
Sharon wants to go out and discuss business.

636
00:34:32.264 --> 00:34:34.134
Why are you going out? She lives there now.

637
00:34:34.134 --> 00:34:36.034
No idea. She wants to go out and do it.

638
00:34:36.873 --> 00:34:38.503
Leave some time for me on the weekends.

639
00:34:38.503 --> 00:34:40.344
If they tell you to work, tell them to shut it.

640
00:34:40.543 --> 00:34:42.614
Why? What are we going to do?

641
00:34:43.043 --> 00:34:44.184
A lot of stuff.

642
00:34:44.884 --> 00:34:46.583
Hae Ra, 100 red bean breads for you.

643
00:34:50.724 --> 00:34:51.884
200 for you.

644
00:34:56.193 --> 00:34:58.764
I got this from an apple pie shop...

645
00:34:58.764 --> 00:35:00.733
that people line up for hours to get one.

646
00:35:00.733 --> 00:35:02.534
Have some with black tea while it's hot.

647
00:35:02.534 --> 00:35:05.503
What's wrong with kids these days?

648
00:35:05.864 --> 00:35:08.034
Why do they line up for an hour...

649
00:35:08.034 --> 00:35:09.333
to get some bread?

650
00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:11.304
That's the fun in life.

651
00:35:11.304 --> 00:35:13.773
I lined up to get you some too.

652
00:35:14.514 --> 00:35:16.943
This is what love and affection is, you know.

653
00:35:17.744 --> 00:35:19.543
Gon must be happy...

654
00:35:19.543 --> 00:35:22.114
to have a great girl like you that he can marry.

655
00:35:22.114 --> 00:35:23.824
If you're feeling depressed,

656
00:35:23.824 --> 00:35:26.654
should I ask Hae Ra's aunt to come over for you?

657
00:35:27.824 --> 00:35:29.924
You don't need to waste money like that.

658
00:35:32.293 --> 00:35:34.463
Right, I have some mangoes.

659
00:35:34.463 --> 00:35:36.233
I'll make you some mango yogurt.

660
00:35:36.233 --> 00:35:38.364
Give me a second. It's amazing.

661
00:35:41.134 --> 00:35:42.904
What a great kid.

662
00:36:05.094 --> 00:36:07.793
Father, have some strawberries first.

663
00:36:09.163 --> 00:36:10.204
This picture.

664
00:36:11.134 --> 00:36:12.134
What is this?

665
00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:13.804
You gave it to me.

666
00:36:14.273 --> 00:36:16.474
Doesn't it look great now that it's enlarged?

667
00:36:17.043 --> 00:36:18.943
That person right there.

668
00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:20.043
Isn't that a woman?

669
00:36:20.043 --> 00:36:22.443
Guys like that are called pretty boys.

670
00:36:22.974 --> 00:36:25.014
She looks a lot like someone I know.

671
00:36:25.784 --> 00:36:26.813
Who?

672
00:36:27.413 --> 00:36:28.684
This person.

673
00:36:30.023 --> 00:36:32.384
There's a nasty woman I know that also looks...

674
00:36:32.384 --> 00:36:34.193
exactly like that person.

675
00:36:35.623 --> 00:36:37.623
How similar are they?

676
00:37:19.304 --> 00:37:21.904
You are a human, right?

677
00:37:22.103 --> 00:37:24.103
How can I help you?

678
00:37:25.404 --> 00:37:27.744
Is this...

679
00:37:29.273 --> 00:37:30.313
a tailor's shop?

680
00:37:30.313 --> 00:37:31.684
I can't help you now...

681
00:37:32.184 --> 00:37:33.454
if you're here to get an outfit.

682
00:37:34.384 --> 00:37:35.654
Our designer is gone.

683
00:37:38.023 --> 00:37:40.623
I can't believe a place like this still exists.

684
00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:43.963
What's the name of that designer?

685
00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:45.793
Sharon.

686
00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:46.994
Pardon?

687
00:37:47.864 --> 00:37:49.463
- Sha... - Sharon.

688
00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:51.563
- Sharon? - Yes, Sharon.

689
00:37:51.563 --> 00:37:53.503
Oh, Sharon.

690
00:37:54.034 --> 00:37:55.534
When will she be back?

691
00:37:56.134 --> 00:37:57.174
No idea.

692
00:37:57.244 --> 00:37:59.204
Do you have a picture...

693
00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.413
of the owner?

694
00:38:02.014 --> 00:38:03.074
No.

695
00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:05.744
Well...

696
00:38:07.614 --> 00:38:09.313
When she gets back,

697
00:38:09.554 --> 00:38:11.454
ask her to give me a call.

698
00:38:12.654 --> 00:38:15.893
It'll be great to have this place redeveloped.

699
00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:23.364
Back then, I went over to the lab...

700
00:38:23.364 --> 00:38:25.934
to give some dumplings which my grandma made...

701
00:38:25.934 --> 00:38:27.503
That doesn't make any sense either.

702
00:38:28.174 --> 00:38:30.244
Why would you bring dumplings to a lab?

703
00:38:30.974 --> 00:38:32.273
Where's my car?

704
00:38:32.273 --> 00:38:33.844
Yes, I came out right away.

705
00:38:34.443 --> 00:38:36.844
I'll be at the entry of this street. Yes.

706
00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:44.353
Dried persimmon, then?

707
00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:53.594
Chul Min.

708
00:38:54.393 --> 00:38:55.994
I'm an aspiring writer...

709
00:38:55.994 --> 00:38:57.804
preparing for a literary contest.

710
00:39:03.034 --> 00:39:04.074
Seo Rin.

711
00:39:15.514 --> 00:39:17.523
Is he someone who's involved with the fire?

712
00:39:17.684 --> 00:39:19.224
I think so.

713
00:39:19.324 --> 00:39:20.424
But we'll never know.

714
00:39:22.353 --> 00:39:23.793
Seo Rin.

715
00:39:24.494 --> 00:39:25.494
It's you, right?

716
00:39:26.463 --> 00:39:29.534
Who are you?

717
00:39:30.204 --> 00:39:32.103
It's me, Chul Min.

718
00:39:32.663 --> 00:39:35.103
I'm the newspaper delivery boy.

719
00:39:44.284 --> 00:39:47.454
How could you not have...

720
00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:49.583
changed at all?

721
00:39:52.824 --> 00:39:53.824
Seo Rin.

722
00:40:02.963 --> 00:40:04.034
Sir.

723
00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:06.503
Are you okay?

724
00:40:08.304 --> 00:40:10.873
Seo Rin. It's you, right?

725
00:40:14.744 --> 00:40:15.844
Where did she go?

726
00:40:16.684 --> 00:40:17.684
No.

727
00:40:21.284 --> 00:40:23.924
I became rich...

728
00:40:24.284 --> 00:40:25.824
because of you.

729
00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.994
I earned money...

730
00:40:28.994 --> 00:40:33.123
by any means possible.

731
00:40:34.563 --> 00:40:38.833
I became rich, Seo Rin.

732
00:40:39.534 --> 00:40:42.233
I asked you to pretend not to know me.

733
00:40:43.773 --> 00:40:45.244
Please get up, sir.

734
00:40:45.244 --> 00:40:46.244
Come on.

735
00:40:56.623 --> 00:40:57.724
Chul Min.

736
00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:02.023
What did you do to Soo Ho's family?

737
00:41:19.674 --> 00:41:21.614
I suddenly came down with a cold.

738
00:41:22.273 --> 00:41:24.114
I feel chilly and sick.

739
00:41:32.284 --> 00:41:34.724
I don't think I can make it to dinner.

740
00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:37.393
I'm sorry for cancelling.

741
00:41:37.523 --> 00:41:38.824
I'll see you at home.

742
00:41:40.863 --> 00:41:42.733
(Hae Ra)

743
00:41:45.233 --> 00:41:47.273
(Hae Ra)

744
00:41:47.273 --> 00:41:48.574
Yes, sir.

745
00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:51.543
With the fuel surcharges,

746
00:41:52.143 --> 00:41:54.943
it comes to 1,238 dollars. That's too expensive.

747
00:41:54.943 --> 00:41:56.614
I'll check the other airlines,

748
00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:58.844
and call you right back. Thank you.

749
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.884
(Jung Hae Ra)

750
00:42:04.424 --> 00:42:06.224
Dinner's been cancelled.

751
00:42:07.023 --> 00:42:08.523
Can I ask you out on a date?

752
00:42:24.373 --> 00:42:25.373
Here I go.

753
00:42:26.474 --> 00:42:28.014
This much?

754
00:42:28.014 --> 00:42:30.213
- More. - This much?

755
00:42:30.213 --> 00:42:32.514
- Nice. - No.

756
00:42:35.284 --> 00:42:37.724
- Which one do you want? - The black one.

757
00:42:37.724 --> 00:42:38.824
- That one? - Yes.

758
00:42:40.193 --> 00:42:41.793
That's stuck. What about something else?

759
00:42:41.793 --> 00:42:43.253
No, I want that one.

760
00:42:45.193 --> 00:42:46.764
All right.

761
00:42:49.864 --> 00:42:51.563
Please.

762
00:43:24.963 --> 00:43:26.503
Today's my payday.

763
00:43:27.873 --> 00:43:29.204
I'll buy you dinner.

764
00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:30.543
Let's go.

765
00:43:34.574 --> 00:43:36.074
If you're pregnant,

766
00:43:36.074 --> 00:43:37.713
act like a mother-to-be.

767
00:43:37.713 --> 00:43:40.083
Why is she hiding it?

768
00:43:40.083 --> 00:43:42.213
How dare you talk about my baby?

769
00:43:42.554 --> 00:43:43.654
What are you doing?

770
00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.054
I'm watching a drama.

771
00:43:45.284 --> 00:43:46.994
It's so entertaining.

772
00:43:47.054 --> 00:43:49.054
You're too diligent.

773
00:43:50.424 --> 00:43:51.963
They're working late.

774
00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.534
They went on a date.

775
00:43:54.063 --> 00:43:56.634
They said they were going to a drive-in theater.

776
00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:57.864
They'll be home late.

777
00:43:58.463 --> 00:44:01.074
She's going to find out.

778
00:44:01.974 --> 00:44:03.744
I said I had a cold.

779
00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.773
A cold, my foot.

780
00:44:06.003 --> 00:44:08.844
That woman lied about being pregnant.

781
00:44:12.043 --> 00:44:14.114
Rock–paper–scissors.

782
00:44:15.713 --> 00:44:17.054
Rock–paper–scissors.

783
00:44:18.123 --> 00:44:20.594
Rock–paper–scissors.

784
00:44:28.634 --> 00:44:30.463
Whoever wins makes a wrap.

785
00:44:30.463 --> 00:44:32.204
- Don't you know? - I do.

786
00:44:32.204 --> 00:44:33.634
That's why I lost on purpose.

787
00:44:33.634 --> 00:44:35.634
Okay, I'll make a wrap for you.

788
00:45:02.034 --> 00:45:03.563
How can I eat this?

789
00:45:15.674 --> 00:45:16.744
Is it good?

790
00:45:23.483 --> 00:45:24.983
- No sugar, right? - No.

791
00:45:31.824 --> 00:45:33.634
You look prettier now.

792
00:45:34.063 --> 00:45:35.663
- Do you want it? - Want what?

793
00:46:00.594 --> 00:46:01.594
Hey.

794
00:46:06.123 --> 00:46:07.333
This is bad.

795
00:46:07.693 --> 00:46:09.634
- I think I'm sick. - What?

796
00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:11.163
You look pretty whatever you do.

797
00:46:13.404 --> 00:46:14.574
Do you want it again?

798
00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:17.003
Come here.

799
00:46:23.043 --> 00:46:24.043
Are you having fun?

800
00:46:26.753 --> 00:46:28.483
I said I was sick.

801
00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.284
I told you I had a cold.

802
00:46:33.293 --> 00:46:35.724
What are you doing?

803
00:46:39.594 --> 00:46:41.333
These onions are making me cry.

804
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:45.304
Of course, they make you cry.

805
00:46:56.074 --> 00:46:58.043
I wish you were gone.

806
00:46:58.384 --> 00:46:59.744
I wish...

807
00:46:59.744 --> 00:47:02.483
you were gone!

808
00:47:21.503 --> 00:47:23.744
On the night the lab was on fire,

809
00:47:25.643 --> 00:47:27.574
I saw a man with glasses...

810
00:47:28.213 --> 00:47:30.614
sneak in to the lab.

811
00:47:34.983 --> 00:47:37.724
The one in Hae Ra's family picture.

812
00:47:43.693 --> 00:47:45.563
I'll become...

813
00:47:45.824 --> 00:47:48.733
richer.

814
00:47:49.034 --> 00:47:51.163
I'll erect flashy buildings...

815
00:47:51.534 --> 00:47:54.373
in Geumseong-dong too.

816
00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:01.543
Watch me.

817
00:48:04.413 --> 00:48:06.043
(Do you have something to say?)

818
00:48:11.983 --> 00:48:13.424
This is boring.

819
00:48:21.793 --> 00:48:23.264
"I think I loved you...

820
00:48:24.764 --> 00:48:26.804
since before I was born."

821
00:48:31.304 --> 00:48:33.143
That's what he just said.

822
00:48:39.614 --> 00:48:40.813
You can't go a day...

823
00:48:40.813 --> 00:48:42.483
without making a joke, can you?

824
00:48:48.094 --> 00:48:49.123
Hae Ra.

825
00:48:49.594 --> 00:48:50.623
Yes?

826
00:48:55.963 --> 00:48:57.833
I think there really is a destiny.

827
00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:03.474
We first met when we were young,

828
00:49:04.244 --> 00:49:06.003
we were apart from each other for a long time,

829
00:49:06.003 --> 00:49:07.543
and we met again.

830
00:49:15.483 --> 00:49:16.724
Soo Ho.

831
00:49:20.594 --> 00:49:21.623
How about...

832
00:49:24.224 --> 00:49:25.824
we never part ways ever again?

833
00:49:40.014 --> 00:49:41.313
We will never do that again.

834
00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:25.324
I'm all alone all the time.

835
00:50:25.324 --> 00:50:29.094
I'm always alone.

836
00:50:35.233 --> 00:50:36.733
Goodness.

837
00:50:38.864 --> 00:50:41.174
Gosh, are you feeling okay?

838
00:50:41.503 --> 00:50:44.204
Hae Ra made pollack soup before she left for work.

839
00:50:44.344 --> 00:50:46.643
If you have it with a lot of green onions,

840
00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.213
you'll get all better.

841
00:50:49.873 --> 00:50:51.384
It's Saturday, but she left for work?

842
00:50:51.913 --> 00:50:54.353
The two went outside early in the morning.

843
00:50:54.483 --> 00:50:55.853
They're having a date today as well?

844
00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:59.353
She isn't considerate of her single aunt.

845
00:50:59.353 --> 00:51:01.154
This isn't right.

846
00:51:01.893 --> 00:51:04.123
I'll take out unmatured kimchi.

847
00:51:07.634 --> 00:51:09.063
Jung Hae Ra,

848
00:51:11.634 --> 00:51:13.103
that witch.

849
00:51:32.824 --> 00:51:33.954
It's pretty old, right?

850
00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.264
If it gets repaired for about two months,

851
00:51:38.264 --> 00:51:39.994
it'll look just as good as before.

852
00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:42.634
I don't need it.

853
00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:44.634
I want to buy it for you.

854
00:51:47.733 --> 00:51:49.804
What will I do alone in this huge house?

855
00:51:50.804 --> 00:51:52.974
You won't be alone. You have me.

856
00:51:53.514 --> 00:51:54.643
You have your aunt too.

857
00:51:57.043 --> 00:51:58.614
Let's go say hello to your father.

858
00:52:23.543 --> 00:52:25.744
His ashes were scattered as a natural burial.

859
00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.014
It's suspicious in many ways.

860
00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.913
I'll send Chairman Park to prison.

861
00:52:35.614 --> 00:52:37.824
I'll stop him from destroying our town too.

862
00:52:39.424 --> 00:52:41.454
Gon's father is a scary man.

863
00:52:44.264 --> 00:52:45.924
That's why I'll face him.

864
00:52:48.994 --> 00:52:50.264
I've prepared a lot.

865
00:52:50.264 --> 00:52:51.404
Don't worry.

866
00:52:57.643 --> 00:52:59.643
Because Soo Ho is always right.

867
00:53:05.143 --> 00:53:06.884
It's cold. Let's go down.

868
00:53:07.014 --> 00:53:08.583
We have one more place to visit.

869
00:53:22.563 --> 00:53:23.603
What's this?

870
00:53:24.264 --> 00:53:25.704
It looks like a granny's ring,

871
00:53:25.704 --> 00:53:26.904
but it feels so good.

872
00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:28.934
It looks good on you.

873
00:53:28.934 --> 00:53:30.744
Ms. Jang gave it to you?

874
00:53:31.043 --> 00:53:32.074
Yes.

875
00:53:37.884 --> 00:53:39.583
I'm sorry for making you wait.

876
00:53:47.054 --> 00:53:49.424
You'll melt this to make couple rings?

877
00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.963
Can you do it with gold or platinum?

878
00:53:53.224 --> 00:53:56.264
It might be better for you to keep it as it is.

879
00:53:58.304 --> 00:54:00.704
It's more than 200 years old.

880
00:54:00.934 --> 00:54:02.974
It's a treasure.

881
00:54:04.143 --> 00:54:06.404
Isn't it an ordinary silver ring?

882
00:54:06.404 --> 00:54:07.474
No.

883
00:54:07.913 --> 00:54:09.514
There's no such thing as this ring.

884
00:54:09.773 --> 00:54:13.043
Make couple rings with something else.

885
00:54:13.043 --> 00:54:15.614
You shouldn't melt this.

886
00:54:22.123 --> 00:54:23.724
Wear it on your 20th-year wedding anniversary.

887
00:54:30.963 --> 00:54:35.304
(Chul Min Development)

888
00:54:35.373 --> 00:54:37.103
Some middle-aged man left it here.

889
00:54:37.704 --> 00:54:39.474
He didn't seem like he was here for suits.

890
00:54:40.514 --> 00:54:42.813
He didn't look so friendly.

891
00:54:43.174 --> 00:54:44.913
Maybe we have some things...

892
00:54:45.284 --> 00:54:47.454
to do as a team.

893
00:54:48.054 --> 00:54:49.213
With him?

894
00:54:51.684 --> 00:54:53.324
Bring me a whetstone.

895
00:54:53.793 --> 00:54:55.724
Did something bad come up?

896
00:54:56.663 --> 00:54:58.764
Don't stay in someone else's house and move out.

897
00:54:59.264 --> 00:55:00.434
Bring it now.

898
00:55:35.963 --> 00:55:38.134
I ground the knife like this...

899
00:55:39.434 --> 00:55:41.204
when it was too hard to stand it.

900
00:55:42.373 --> 00:55:44.904
I waited for him because I had hope.

901
00:55:56.413 --> 00:55:58.284
The blade is really worn out.

902
00:56:04.364 --> 00:56:06.193
No, not at all.

903
00:56:06.324 --> 00:56:07.994
I've never heard of the name, Yoon Dal Hong,

904
00:56:07.994 --> 00:56:10.233
in Mr. Moon's office.

905
00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:13.003
They didn't talk about taking away the contract?

906
00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:16.333
No, I've never heard of it.

907
00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:21.543
Mr. Moon is so busy...

908
00:56:21.543 --> 00:56:24.083
that he hasn't worked out for about two weeks.

909
00:56:24.643 --> 00:56:27.014
I'll tell you when I hear something new.

910
00:56:29.514 --> 00:56:30.554
Okay.

911
00:56:31.853 --> 00:56:33.083
The executive of a construction company,

912
00:56:33.083 --> 00:56:34.324
Han Myung Soo, and Park Chul Min...

913
00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:36.154
had a suspicious money transaction.

914
00:56:38.123 --> 00:56:40.293
Park Chul Min bought this three story building...

915
00:56:40.293 --> 00:56:41.833
as his first property.

916
00:56:42.293 --> 00:56:44.163
(Property Certificate)

917
00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:45.704
After a year,

918
00:56:45.704 --> 00:56:47.603
he gained a huge profit as he bought and sold...

919
00:56:47.603 --> 00:56:49.733
the land of Jung Hae Ra's father.

920
00:56:50.704 --> 00:56:54.344
Han Myung Soo and his men are related to all these.

921
00:56:55.674 --> 00:56:57.784
Was it a coincidence that Mr. Yoon owned the land?

922
00:56:57.943 --> 00:57:00.454
If not, there must be something behind it too.

923
00:57:01.353 --> 00:57:03.983
I'm investigating the issue with our attorneys.

924
00:57:05.154 --> 00:57:07.954
Let's bring up an issue...

925
00:57:07.954 --> 00:57:09.654
and send the documents to the police next week.

926
00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:10.994
Yes, sir.

927
00:57:25.543 --> 00:57:27.373
- Are you done talking? - Yes.

928
00:57:27.373 --> 00:57:28.713
You think it'll work out well?

929
00:57:30.583 --> 00:57:31.884
Good job.

930
00:57:37.023 --> 00:57:38.884
You said it looked old, but it looks good on you.

931
00:57:41.623 --> 00:57:43.594
I feel good when I wear this.

932
00:57:43.594 --> 00:57:44.824
I gain strength too.

933
00:57:44.824 --> 00:57:46.264
- Really? - Yes.

934
00:57:46.934 --> 00:57:48.063
Here.

935
00:57:51.563 --> 00:57:52.603
All right.

936
00:57:52.963 --> 00:57:54.074
Ready.

937
00:57:55.804 --> 00:57:56.844
Go.

938
00:58:03.074 --> 00:58:04.483
You lost on purpose, didn't you?

939
00:58:04.483 --> 00:58:05.983
I did. Let's go home.

940
00:58:07.213 --> 00:58:08.253
Goodness.

941
00:58:09.054 --> 00:58:12.384
Oh, right. Sharon is sick,

942
00:58:12.384 --> 00:58:14.224
so let's buy some fruits on our way home.

943
00:58:14.523 --> 00:58:16.494
You feel depressed and lonely when you're sick.

944
00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:17.963
I'll get my things.

945
00:58:17.963 --> 00:58:18.994
Okay.

946
00:58:24.603 --> 00:58:25.603
(From Mr. Park)

947
00:58:31.043 --> 00:58:33.003
Are you not taking the store...

948
00:58:33.003 --> 00:58:35.643
because you feel guilty for Moon Soo Ho's father?

949
00:58:43.824 --> 00:58:45.784
Is it because of what your father did...

950
00:58:45.784 --> 00:58:47.523
to Doctor Moon?

951
00:58:51.864 --> 00:58:54.063
Doctor Moon wasn't killed by the fire.

952
00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:59.264
Your dad killed him.

953
00:59:01.373 --> 00:59:02.373
Yes?

954
00:59:03.204 --> 00:59:06.304
Can you find some articles about Edinburgh?

955
00:59:06.974 --> 00:59:09.744
You also know how much your dad...

956
00:59:09.744 --> 00:59:10.943
despised Soo Ho.

957
00:59:14.654 --> 00:59:16.983
Does Soo Ho also know...

958
00:59:17.384 --> 00:59:20.123
how he tried to send him to an orphanage?

959
00:59:24.424 --> 00:59:25.424
Dad.

960
00:59:25.764 --> 00:59:26.934
What's this document?

961
00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:29.764
Are you going to send him to an orphanage?

962
00:59:29.764 --> 00:59:32.404
You still have no idea how happy you are.

963
00:59:32.663 --> 00:59:34.674
That means he's useless.

964
00:59:35.304 --> 00:59:37.643
And you two fooled around with the lights off.

965
00:59:37.643 --> 00:59:39.804
We made shadow pictures just that once.

966
00:59:40.114 --> 00:59:41.713
You're horrible.

967
00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:43.543
Don't you feel bad for him?

968
00:59:44.313 --> 00:59:45.614
You're the one who made money...

969
00:59:45.614 --> 00:59:47.184
with the stolen documents written by Doctor Moon.

970
00:59:47.983 --> 00:59:49.083
What did you say?

971
00:59:49.253 --> 00:59:50.454
Shut your mouth.

972
00:59:50.884 --> 00:59:52.724
If you send him to an orphanage,

973
00:59:53.293 --> 00:59:54.793
I'm going to run away too.

974
00:59:56.724 --> 00:59:57.994
That little...

975
00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:00.333
Once Soo Ho begins to investigate his past,

976
01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:03.704
he'll find everything about your dad too.

977
01:00:06.364 --> 01:00:08.373
I will send the documents which I wrote then...

978
01:00:08.373 --> 01:00:09.974
to Soo Ho...

979
01:00:11.543 --> 01:00:13.413
and to the police very soon.

980
01:00:15.213 --> 01:00:18.014
We can discuss everything else in person.

981
01:00:22.983 --> 01:00:24.083
Is something wrong?

982
01:00:26.893 --> 01:00:27.893
No.

983
01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.324
Let's go.
