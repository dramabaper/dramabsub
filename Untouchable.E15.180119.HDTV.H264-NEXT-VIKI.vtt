<i>Timing & subtitles brought to you by the Touch Me If You Can Team @ Viki</i>

2
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.600
Why did you ask to see me?

3
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.300
Gi Seo...

4
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.900
Father...

5
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.380
It's been a long time, Gi Seo.

6
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.900
Father, why...

7
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.200
Are you asking because you really don't know?

8
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.600
You should have known.

9
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.800
You should have realized

10
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.100
why I had to do this.

11
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.000
That's right. There were a lot of things that needed you to be dead to be solved.

12
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.800
But I really don't know the reason why you had to trick me as well.

13
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.000
I believed in you.

14
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.000
What did you believe in?

15
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.200
If you tell me to move my hands, I move my hands,

16
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800
if you tell me to move my feet, I move my feet,

17
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.800
did you believe that I would become your dog that lived like that forever?

18
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.400
What should we do now?

19
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400
What kind of dog tricks are you going to ask

20
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.800
your idiotic son to do?

21
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.400
What were you so unsatisfied with that you had to jump out from the grave?

22
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.290
Your grandfather

23
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.820
raised me as harshly as I raised you.

24
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.580
That's why I became stronger and was able to protect the Bukcheon that your grandfather raised.

25
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.000
You didn't choose me then.

26
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.100
So I don't understand why you're telling me this now.

27
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.000
My father didn't choose me either.

28
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.600
My father didn't let go off Bukcheon until the day he died.

29
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.000
That's why I betrayed my father who made me stronger.

30
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I became my father's dog and took everything of his forcefully.

31
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.800
He only acknowledged me

32
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.700
after I took everything from me.

33
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.300
You have to become a beast who will rip his own father apart

34
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.400
to become Bukcheon's owner.

35
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.800
Are you telling me

36
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.200
to become just like you?

37
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.000
I wasn't the eldest son originally.

38
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.800
If he's a hindrance to your future, throw Joon Seo away.

39
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.130
Thank you for what you have given me father.

40
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.920
Now I understand what you mean.

41
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.920
Gi Seo.

42
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.990
I missed you, my son.

43
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.530
<i>Untouchable
- 15 -</i>

44
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.800
Are you saying this person will protect me?

45
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.200
This person is the previous mayor Jang Beom Ho's son.

46
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.200
He saved you.

47
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.200
Even so, they're of the same bloodline, same family. How can I trust this person?

48
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.800
Prosecutor, I don't think this place is right. Please move me to another place.

49
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.600
Excuse me, if you really can't trust us, walk out with your own two feet. We won't chase after you.

50
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.200
What?

51
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.000
If you want, I can take you to Seoul.

52
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.300
Although I don't know if Seoul will be safe or not.

53
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.300
Are you guys threatening me?

54
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.400
It's not just Bukcheon, there's no place in Korea that you will be safe.

55
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.000
We aren't safe if we're with you. We are also putting our lives on the line.

56
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.200
Trust us.

57
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.200
This is the best I can do to protect you.

58
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.900
Even so, these people...

59
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.400
Just do what I tell you to do.

60
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.200
I will determine the way you live.

61
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.900
The moment I let you go, you'll die.

62
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.000
<i>Hello.</i>

63
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.800
<i>You're the prosecutor who took me to the hospital not long ago, right?</i>

64
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.400
<i>Yes.</i>

65
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.030
<i>Ah, yes. Please sit down.</i>

66
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.600
How did uncle pass away? [His father's elder brother]

67
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.800
Why are you asking about Beom Ju Hyung suddenly?

68
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.700
Since father is gone, shouldn't I handle his estate?

69
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.900
I need to know how he died to respect his wishes in caring for his estate.

70
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.100
Tell me what you know please.

71
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.400
Team leader, he's not safe here either. If he stopped by at the prosecutor's office, that means information could have been leaked.

72
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.500
That's true. The cops are all over that place.

73
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.300
We can't say that's not a possibility.

74
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.200
I found out the area where Joo Tae Seob's phone signal was.

75
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.600
Where is he?

76
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.300
He was located in the sea near Bukcheon, but looking at the map...

77
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.800
Heugryeongdo is the most likely place.

78
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.510
Heugryeongdo...

79
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.600
He died in an accident when he went to Japan with your father.

80
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.000
Luckily, Beom Ho Hyung survived.

81
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.200
At the time, Beom Ho Hyung was in shock

82
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.100
so we were forbidden from talking about it.

83
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.800
What was the reason behind the accident?

84
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.400
Your father who was with him would have known best.

85
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.500
As you know, your father

86
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.500
was someone with a lot of greed.

87
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.170
Don't think too much about what happened with Ja Gyeong.

88
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.300
You will become mayor in the end.

89
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.800
Bukcheon will definitely fail without the Jang family.

90
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.000
People know that.

91
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.600
Hello Uncle.

92
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.400
Have you been well? It's hard to see you around.

93
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.000
Hello.

94
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.400
Aren't you Doctor Yoo from Bukcheon Hospital?

95
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.800
Why are you here?

96
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.400
i brought him here.

97
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.500
He's the doctor who treated father until the end.

98
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.530
When I think about what I would bring out from that house,

99
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.600
this is the only thing that was mine.

100
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.400
That family is going to fall apart soon,

101
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.000
even if you take it out after they fall, it's not too late.

102
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.200
Ah, there was one more thing other than this.

103
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.000
That land under my name.

104
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.300
Isn't that enough?

105
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.400
Don't I become the new owner of Bukcheon now?

106
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.200
Just because the land is in your possession,

107
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.600
it doesn't mean you're the owner.

108
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.000
You have to own the people on the land

109
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.800
to become the true owner.

110
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.400
Then do that for me.

111
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.000
You still don't know people.

112
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
That's not it. You...

113
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
still don't have any thoughts of giving me what is yours.

114
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.000
Give me everything. Then I'll cry for you...

115
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.800
when you die.

116
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.210
Starting from tomorrow, come home for dinner if you don't have any meetings,

117
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.900
I'll make dinner for you myself.

118
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.740
Thanks.

119
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.400
Did that doctor say so?

120
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.400
That father didn't pass away, but pretended to pass away?

121
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.200
If you're curious, go listen to what he has to say.

122
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.070
Forget it.

123
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.140
Did you know or did Father let you know?

124
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.620
What's the reason you brought that Doctor all the way here?

125
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:51.640
Because I didn't think Father would leave alone the person who knows his secret.

126
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.410
You feel our house is the safest place?

127
00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.490
That doctor will reveal that Father is alive.

128
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.700
I'm not interested in your election.

129
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.660
But you'll have to prepare for what will happen after the truth have been revealed.

130
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.840
I'm grateful to you for being considerate toward me.

131
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.690
But I worry about you more.

132
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.670
Did you meet with Father?

133
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.320
Don't go up against Father.

134
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.150
Father is a monster. A worse monster than you think.

135
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.720
Don't worry. I can become a monster myself.

136
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.690
Come in if you think you can kill me in this house.

137
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.100
Is this the answer to my request, Father?

138
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.250
Did Father order you?

139
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.420
You'll have to go through me from now on.

140
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.380
Let's get along.

141
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.240
Please give me a call.

142
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.220
I want to find Father.

143
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.070
You already know.

144
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.150
You even spoke of it yourself.

145
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.580
<i>Beom Ho is alive.</i>

146
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.600
You must miss your deceased father very much.

147
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.920
Father is in Heugryeongdo right now.

148
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.940
It's something the world would be shocked to hear.

149
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:44.410
A friend whom I thought was dead is living in Heugryeongdo.

150
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.170
Please let me enter Heugryeongdo.

151
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.590
Why should I?

152
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.490
You want the Jang family destroyed.

153
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.530
I want to know my father well.

154
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:07.350
I hope you'd tell me everything you know about my fahter.

155
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.690
Well, what do you think I'd know?

156
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:17.720
I'll give you back the life you had back in Bukcheon.

157
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.320
I'm grateful, but...

158
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.760
Where Father's people came from...

159
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.180
Why they're so loyal to him to the extent of putting their lives on the line...

160
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:36.100
In place of my deceased father, shouldn't I take care of those people as his eldest son?

161
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.610
I had turned my back against you, President Jang.

162
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:47.410
That's right. That's why I'm asking you to give me a reason why I shouldn't kill you.

163
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:10.690
If you find live Jang Beom Ho, it's over for Beom Ho or Gi Seo.

164
00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:16.660
But I don't think the Jang family would be destroyed by doing that.

165
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.620
One person whom I worry about the most still remains.

166
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.590
Wouldn't I be easier for you to deal with rather than my father?

167
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.620
I have a harder time dealing with guys like you.

168
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.190
It becomes tiresome to deal with a guy without any ambitions.

169
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.570
Do you think I don't have any ambitions?

170
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.080
I have inherited my father's blood.

171
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.960
After you destroy your father, who's next?

172
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.110
When my enemy becomes older and weak...

173
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.350
Strangely, I feel like I become weak, too.

174
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:05.980
If you're going to become a Jang Beom Ho anyway, become a very strong Jang Beom Ho.

175
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.990
So that I'd feel like it's worth a fight.

176
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:14.100
Okay. I'll do my best not to disappoint you.

177

It will be temporary, but I'll help you, Joon Seo.

178
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.680
What I did was to catch criminals and...

179
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.670
Rather than sending them to prison, I was to hand them over to Director Yong.

180

Kang Mo Sik and others... They're criminals I handed over as well.

Well? I never counted, but...

183

I think there's more than a hundred only the guys I handed over.

<i>Here comes candidate Jang Gi Seo!</i>

317
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.540
Hello.

318
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.330
I'm Gongwha democratic party mayoral candidate, Jang Gi Seo.

319
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:35.580
<i>Jang Gi Seo! Jang Gi Seo! Jang Gi Seo!</i>

320
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.450
Everyone. Mayor Jang Beom Ho

321
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.330
is alive.

322
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.300
He's alive

323
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.450
and is watching over us from above.

324
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.870
Mayor Jang Beom Ho

325
00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.010
will be with Bukcheon for forever.

326
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:07.790
Jang Beom Ho! Jang Beom Ho! Jang Beom Ho!

327
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.710
No, you can't. No way.

328
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.700
<i>Why? People aren't buying that doctor's testimony.</i>

329
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.000
I'm the only person who's seen your father personally. I can come forward as a witness.

330
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.790
It's not something that can be handled with you coming forward.

331
00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.470
As long as we find my father at Heugryeongdo, it will all be resolved.

332
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.210
I'm saying this because a warrant can't be issued.

333
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.710
Just wait a little longer. I'll find out more.

334
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:32.310
So, please step up recklessly. Please...

335
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.950
Then I'll find another doctor to help

336
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.600
reveal the fabrication of his death.

337
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.660
Okay, instead don't go around by yourself.

338
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.070
Be with me all the time.

339
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.490
Okay, I'll contact you.

340
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:21.140
<i>Everyone, even 50 years ago...</i>

341
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.130
<i>Bukcheon was merely a poor countryside.</i>

342
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:32.080
<i>But now, we've become one of the richest cities in Korea!</i>

343
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.470
<i>Your grandfathers, fathers...</i>

344
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:43.390
It's a result of their blood and sweat.

345
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.960
You can never forget the roots of Bukcheon!

346
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.900
A tree without roots can never fruit.

347
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.350
Even after 100 years, Bukcheon...

348
00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.610
will flower beautifully even after a thousand years.

349
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.410
It will become a tree with a thousand year history.

350
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.980
I, Jang Gi Seo

351
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.900
will definitely protect Bukcheon!

352
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:18.600
Jang Beom Ho! Jang Gi Seo! Jang Beom Ho!

353
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.920
Why? For what?

354
00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.430
No matter how you hide it, it'll be revealed one day.

355
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.280
Why are you protecting father? Why?

356
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.930
I'm the eldest son of the family.

357
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.250
I have to protect my family.

358
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:38.710
Did father say that? Did he tell you to protect your family?

359
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.760
That's his excuse.

360
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.340
He's someone who lived for his own ambition. Please don't fall for his lies.

361
00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:52.290
And you? Don't you think you only lived thinking about yourself?

362
00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.860
Hyung...

363
00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:00.020
I've been too controlled by the people around me thus far.

364
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.770
I finally saw the true ambition that was lying underneath me.

365
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.300
I'll have it.

366
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:17.980
Even if I have to put on Father's dirty shell, I'll have it.

367
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.060
I lived swallowing all that inside.

368
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.640
I'll throw it all up.

369
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.800
If I have to spit on Father, I'll do that.

370
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.570
If you get in my way, I'll get rid of you too.

371
00:31:49.594 --> 00:31:54.594

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

372
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.200
I ordered the employees to cooperate with search and seizure effort.

373
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.300
But I'm not sure if this will be effective.

374
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.110
I'm sure he probably hid anything relating to Heugryeongdo.

375
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:19.350
Don't worry. You just have to pretend.

376
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.860
The search and seizure conducted by the Prosecutors' Office is all like that.

377
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:27.500
You don't find evidence, you make evidence.

378
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:33.390
Just wait. There will be a search warrant on Heugryeongdo.

379
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.860
I understand.

380
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.750
<i>I finally saw the true ambition that was lying underneath me.</i>

381
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.070
<i>I'm going to take it all.</i>

382
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.840
Yes.

383
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.640
Okay, I'll go to the Prosecutor's office soon.

384
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.680
I feel like I've found my lost daughter. It's nice.

385
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:29.350
Is father-in-law really alive?

386
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:37.480
How could that be so? It's just a rumour.

387
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:47.860
I'm sure there's former mayor Jang Beom Ho's old medical records if I look for it.

388
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:54.520
No matter how sudden his death was, it could be a problem if there weren't any indications in his medical records previously.

389
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.960
Thank you so much.

390
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.400
No, of course I have to help you.

391
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.470
If it weren't for your help last time during the malpractice suit, I would've had to take off my gown long ago.

392
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.000
I just followed the law.

393
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.770
Okay.

394
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:15.230
Ah, but after that ended, I asked you to go for a drink...

395
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.980
why didn't you respond?

396
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.210
Ah, well...

397
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.110
I'm sorry, but as a prosecutor it's a bit...

398
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:29.170
No matter how much I would like to, I have to avoid meeting with people involved in the case.

399
00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.760
I even texted you twice after that.

400
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.420
Oh my, what do I do. I'm sorry.

401
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.460
I must have ignored your kindness.

402
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.880
What do I do? You must have been really upset.

403
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.790
That doctor is quite a good person.

404
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.380
He comes from a good family and he's skilled.

405
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.210
When I first got his text, I hesitated for a bit.

406
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.560
I thought, should I just go out with him?

407
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.690
No, no. If I meet with all of them like this, I won't be able to work.

408
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.400
So I made a decision.

409
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.870
I was going to hide my charm, it'll get in the way of work.

410
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:10.460
But the men somehow always manage to find out about my charm.

411
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:15.880
Then what can I do? I really want to end things with people I meet through work, with work.

412
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.410
Contact that doctor,

413
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.560
and ask him to go through the death certificate.

414
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.010
There is a way.

415
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:35.050
When I meet a man through work, I'll just think of <i>someone's</i> face.

416
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:41.310
Then I'll see them all as a wood chip with no emotion at all.

417
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:46.460
This is a good. As expected, you have to chew a sandwich for it taste good.

418
00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.620
A wood chip even knows how to smile.

419
00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.530
Hey, drink this and eat slowly.

420
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:16.680
<i>Timing & subtitles brought to you by the Touch Me If You Can Team @ Viki</i>

421
00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.190
It's been a while.

422
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.350
Is Beom Ho doing well?

423
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.660
What's the reason you came to find me?

424
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.230
Beom Ho and I are really old friends.

425
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.680
I also received a lot of help from him.

426
00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:11.590
I believe it's my duty to help him out when he's having a hard time.

427
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:19.440
I want to share the days and nights in Bukcheon with my friend.

428
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:25.350
Beom Ho can have the nights and I can have the days.

429
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:32.180
But I'm thinking of making sure he's tied up in the dark world of Bukcheon.

430
00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.610
So that no one can find him.

431
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.710
Tell Harimoto this.

432
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.670
Our friendship will never change.

433
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.920
Even if I don't tell him, he will already know.

434
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.030
Because you two are friends who get each other.

435
00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.890
There's no one who knows me like Beom Ho.

436
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:03.150
There also isn't anyone who knows him as well as I do.

437
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.610
Are you not going home?

438
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.630
There's a lot to prepare for Yong Hak Soo's next trial.

439
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.960
I think I have to stay up all night.

440
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.260
Thank you.

441
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.100
For what?

442
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.000
I'm just thankful.

443
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.090
I'm the one who's thankful.

444
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.560
If I hadn't met you,

445
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:43.150
I probably would have been obsessed with becoming successful, and turned out my like my mom and your father.

446
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.990
I'm also thankful that you think that.

447
00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:57.040
Do you still think about Jung Hye unnie a lot?

448
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.310
Well, sometimes.

449
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:08.120
Team Leader, you still love Jung Hye unnie, right?

450
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.890
Yes.

451
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.080
I guess asked something obvious.

452
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.400
Hey.

453
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.930
I hope you can listen without misunderstanding.

454
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:31.860
So, what I want to say is... This could be something that I'm saying out of frustration.

455
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.920
I'll probably regret it in thirty seconds.

456
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:43.890
But... I think I have to say it now.

457
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:50.800
If not, I think my heart will burst...

458
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.210
The love you had with Jung Hye unnie,

459
00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.940
you won't do it again.

460
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.950
I know that.

461
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.830
But...

462
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.210
if you were to start a love like that again...

463
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:17.930
I wish it would be with me.

464
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.660
Ah, what the. This is so embarrassing.

465
00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.440
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.490
I can only say thank you again.

467
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.990
Hey, Seo I Ra, if you're going to stay out over night, don't you have to contact me?

468
00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:08.320
You're busy. You don't have time to deal with me.

469
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.540
Talk with me.

470
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.860
I have to wash up and go out.

471
00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.550
I Ra...

472
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.990
can you try and understand me?

473
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.260
About politics...

474
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:29.130
They exaggerate what's real and they even turn things that don't exist into facts.

475
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.060
The me in politics isn't the real me.

476
00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.810
I'm not that bad of a woman.

477
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.290
I'm just a player in the game of politics.

478
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:43.260
Are you trying to go back to being the old mom because you think you're going to lose the election?

479
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:48.020
It doesn't matter what you think of me right now,

480
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.910
but I hope you know this one thing.

481
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:58.070
As the rumor says, I'm not that petty of a person to come up with a fabrication that says deceased Jang Beom Ho is alive.

482
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.660
I know that. Because Jang Beom Ho is really alive.

483
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.650
What are you saying?

484
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.940
I saw him with my own eyes.

485
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:15.630
Is that why you carry a gun around?

486
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.820
You said this. That you'll make sure you relieve the resentments of the deceased detectives who died unjustly.

487
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.800
What you need to do is to reveal that fact when Jang Beom Ho comes back...

488
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.600
and relieve their resentments.

489
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:38.140
To me, you seemed more like my mom when you were a police chief than you are now.

490
00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.680
Reporter Kim.

491
00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.660
My older brother passed away. He died!

492
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:56.470
Why do you create such a chaos after hearing such a false rumor?

493
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:59.280
Do reporters not have anything to do these days?

494
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.120
Bye!

495
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.560
My phone ringing off the hook.

496
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:12.020
We had his funeral and even cremated him. How could he be alive?

497
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.850
It could happen because we cremated him.

498
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.260
What?

499
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.030
Hey, even the zombies that come out in the movies...

500
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.280
They can come back to life only if there's a dead body.

501
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.710
Because we cremated him, there's no way to confirm his death.

502
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:31.930
If Uncle is alive, I'm sure he knows everything we've been up to.

503
00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:36.730
Then... we're dead, Father.

504
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.170
Beom Ho. How could you...

505
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:13.140
I heard baits are good these days. Did you catch lots of fish?

506
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.120
Yeah, yeah...

507
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:22.960
I heard you said you're going to hide me.

508
00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:25.360
Yeah.

509
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:33.300
The fact that you're alive... I'll never let that be revealed to the world.

510
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.040
I'll do whatever it takes to stop that.

511
00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.800
Yong Chan... Thank you!

512
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.570
Beom Ho...

513
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.180
Go with this.

514
00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:56.100
Live as Harimoto. Become Harimoto and plan a new life with me.

515
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.920
Up until the time our Jang family made you a president...

516
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:10.200
You worked with the law. So you must know law better than anyone.

517
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:22.120
Beom Ho...

518
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:43.420
I'm a dead man to this world.

519
00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:49.300
There's no need to protect a dead man in this world.

520
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.750
Jang Beom Ho is alive.

521
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.930
You don't need to deceive me also.

522
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.200
My daughter doesn't deceive me.

523
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:26.030
If Jang Beom Ho is alive, he must be in Heugryeongdo. That's the only place he'd be.

524
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:35.450
We must find Jang Beom Ho and prove that he's alive.

525
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.880
Then the election will completely turn around.

526
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.470
When I used to be the police chief...

527
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.770
The detectives who went to Heugryeongdo died mysteriously.

528
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:55.950
At the time, Jang Beom Ho personally called me and tried to appease me.

529
00:46:55.950 --> 00:47:00.050
He said, "I'll go to the courtroom and testify."

530
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.860
And he admitted himself that he killed the Japanese businessman Ito.

531
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.330
There's no hole to escape.

532
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.500
Yes.

533
00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:20.230
Where's Dad right now?

534
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:27.190
Who is it? Who did this to you, Dad?

535
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:34.050
Jang Beom Ho. Is it him?

536
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:53.130
I'll get him. Jang Beom Ho...

537
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:01.070
Unlike you, I don't have much to lose.

538
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.780
So, I'm not afraid of that man.

539
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.520
<i>If Jang Beom Ho is alive, he must be in Heugryeongdo. That's the only place he'd be.</i>

540
00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.010
<i>[ Phone call record ]</i>

541
00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:26.570
<i>[ Permit to handle explosives ]</i>

542
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.560
<i>[ Permit to transport hazardous items ]</i>

543
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.750
It's proof that Bukcheon Maritime Corporation budget is going into Heugryeongdo.

544
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:38.020
Several billion wons are being spent on maintaining Heugryeongdo every year.

545
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.610
At the time when the detectives disappeared...

546
00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:47.560
There's evidence that shows that explosives that were used to blow up the pond was transported illegally to Heugryeongdo.

547
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.550
<i>[ Cash Expense Record
Joo Tae Seop ]</i>

548
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:54.320
<i>[ Cash Expense Record
Kang Moon Sik ]</i>

549
00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.700
<i>[ Cash Expense Record
Park Tae Jin ]</i>

550
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:02.370
I'm sorry, but you'll have to explain how you obtained this document.

551
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:06.090
Because I can't exclude the possibility that it was fabricated.

552
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.620
That...

553
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:15.020
Deceased Yoon Jung Hye hid that and gave it to me.

554
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:18.300
Jung Hye Unnie?

555
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:26.270
I feel bad toward Dad, but I'll forget about it.

556
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.980
I won't blame anyone.

557
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:35.590
So, just let me and Joon Seo be together.

558
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:41.030
I beg you. That's all I want.

559
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.910
Please.

560
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.230
Did your conversation go over well?

561
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:27.790
All right. I'll deliver this to my husband.

562
00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:32.900
You're safe now.

563
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:37.400
Go. To be with Joon Seo.

564
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.380
I wish you well.

565
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.510
Yoon Jung Hye.

566
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:16.650
Then, the reason Jung Hye died is...

567
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:22.360
I met Yoon Jung Hye to save her.

568
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:28.770
That's the reason why my number was listed on her call list.

569
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:31.560
Why didn't you show me this document earlier?

570
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:37.350
Because I was still the daughter-in-law of Jang family.

571
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:43.190
<i>I have to go to Yong Hak Soo's second day in court right now.</i>

572
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.780
<i>Please organize the document, so that the inspector can turn it over to the judge to issue a warrant.</i>

573
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.740
<i>It's a file that deceased Yoon Jung Hye personally turned over to Goo Ja Gyeong.</i>

574
00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:53.210
<i>If we link Yoon Jung Hye's murder case with the detectives' incident three years ago...</i>

575
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.550
<i>We'll be able to get a warrant to search Heugryeongdo.</i>

576
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.830
<i> The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail. </i>

577
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.770
He's not answering?

578
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.040
Aren't you trusting Goo Yong Chan too much?

579
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.650
I'm going to go see him myself.

580
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:13.880
Aren't you going to go to Yong Hak Soo's second day in court?

581
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:19.170
That trial means nothing to me now. There's no way Yong ahjussi's attitude will change either.

582
00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:22.900
Prosecutor Seo went to the trial. I'm sure she'll take care of it well.

583
00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:30.090
Two years before she died, Yoon Jung Hye went to work for Bukcheon Maritime Corporation under the fake name Jo Min Joo.

584
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:33.540
While she was there, the ones who caused her father's death...

585
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.960
She found documents pertaining to secrets of Heugryeongdo and snuck it out.

586
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.060
That's the reason why she had to be murdered.

587
00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:45.700
Can I see that document?

588
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.460
Due to the fact that I obtained it right before the trial, it hasn't been organized yet.

589
00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.100
I'll submit it for the next trial day.

590
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:58.370
To summarize, you're saying Yoon Jung Hye was murdered trying to take revenge for her father's death. Right?

591
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.900
I believe that what Yoon Jung Hye wanted was not revenge.

592
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.400
Yoon Jung Hye was a young woman in her late 20s

593
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.690
who attended Korea Medical School.

594
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:14.270
She was someone who could have lived a life that others would have been jealous of.

595
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:20.750
However, she betted her own life and chose a hard path.

596
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:27.410
What Yoon Jung Hye really wanted, wasn't revenge for her father

597
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:31.970
but justice that hid behind the strength of power.

598
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.910
I heard you got caught in the waves while fishing.

599
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.640
You should have been careful.

600
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.700
Don't go to such dangerous places.

601
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:54.160
You can't be careless of Bukcheon's sea.

602
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.240
Even if it's calm as if it were dead, it could come alive suddenly

603
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.530
and come over you.

604
00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.220
Why did you come?

605
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:33.260
He's your father, of course I should come.

606
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:38.430
Remember this. I'm not weak like my father.

607
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.920
Do you think of me as an enemy now?

608
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.830
I am thankful to you.

609
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:56.770
<i>It was me, right?</i>

610
00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:00.230
<i>I, Goo Ja Gyeong, instructed you to do that, right?</i>

611
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.510
<i>Yes. That's right.</i>

612
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.890
<i>You took my orders</i>

613
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:10.550
<i>and Jang Gyu Ho, you personally met Joo Tae Seob</i>

614
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:14.730
<i>and told him to kill Ahn Jin Gyeong?</i>

615
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:21.960
I'm prepared. I'm the one who broke the deal.

616
00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.460
<i>Would you like to delete 1 file?
Delete</i>

617
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:37.830
You helped me find my hidden ambition.

618
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:42.180
<i>That ambition will erase you. Forever.</i>

619
00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.580
Our defendant would like to speak for himself.

620
00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:56.930
Yes, please go ahead.

621
00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:04.700
I ordered Yoon Jung Hye's murder.

622
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.230
What is the reason?

623
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:10.140
Yoon Jung Hye lied about her identity and...

624
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:15.050
faked her marriage to Jang Joon Seo, the son of mayor Jang Beom Ho.

625
00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:20.890
But I didn't plan and act this out alone.

626
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.540
There is someone else who instructed me to kill Yoon Jung Hye.

627
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:28.900
Are you saying you will reveal the person who instructed you to kill her?

628
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:33.270
Yes. It was Jang Joon Seo.

629
00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:38.190
Are you saying you will reveal the person who instructed you to kill her?

630
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:42.470
Yes. It was Jang Joon Seo.

631
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.440
Jang Joon Seo couldn't forgive Yoon Jung Hye

632
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.730
who betrayed him and his family.

633
00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.150
He isn't at home either.

634
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:59.510
Please tell me if you know of any incident or news about Goo Yong Chan's whereabouts.

635
00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:00.810
Yes.

636
00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:06.950
Oh, Prosecutor Seo, how did the trial go?

637
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:08.840
Where are you right now?

638
00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.640
I got it. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

639
00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.280
Things just got complicated, I'll tell you in detail when I see you.

640
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:18.740
Arrest Jang Joon Seo.

641
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.250
Yes, Team Leader Go.

642
00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:59.730
<i>Yong Hak Soo has pointed you out as the person behind all this at the trial.</i>

643
00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:01.370
<i>I think you need to go in hiding.</i>

644
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:04.360
<i>Noh Ji Hwan has ordered for you to be arrested.</i>

645
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:07.700
They want to lock me up.

646
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:11.170
That's the only intention, so there's no need to worry too much.

647
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:15.790
I was going to meet Prosecutor Seo, so I'll meet with her and hear from her in detail.

648
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.730
I instructed the police beforehand

649
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:31.370
so Joon Seo will be caught soon.

650
00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.870
Even if he gets away, in the meantime

651
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:39.500
it'll be hard for him to do whatever he wants.

652
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.210
Thanks, Yong Ahjusshi.

653
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.750
<i> The call is not going through. After the beep... </i>

654
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:51.750
She's not picking up the phone.

655
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:54.810
Jae Ho, didn't you follow her to the courthouse?

656
00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:58.790
I was waiting in the parking lot. She was supposed to contact me after the trial

657
00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:00.690
but she went to you immediately without contacting me.

658
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:02.660
I think they put you in ball and chain and...

659
00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:05.560
they messed with Prosecutor Seo. She's in danger.

660
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.820
They won't be able to kill her.

661
00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:12.140
They won't be able to do something like this to me again.

662
00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.540
Bunch of cops are rushing over here from Seopadong intersection.

663
00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:16.890
They'll be charging in here any minute.

664
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.740
-It's this guy right?
-Yea.

665
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:31.960
This way.

666
00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:34.060
Stop there!

667
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.540
Team Leader, where are you going?

668
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.930
It's been a long time.

669
00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:54.890
Didn't you come see me because you missed me?

670
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:59.330
-Let go!
-I'll buy you a drink, so let's go.
- I said to let go!

671
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:01.020
Let's go!

672
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.690
Joon Seo, where are you?

673
01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:29.290
You didn't do it right? It was father, right?

674
01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.660
Rest for the meantime.

675
01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.420
I'm giving you a chance to rest.

676
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.890
It's a choice Yong Ahjusshi made for you too.

677
01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:41.930
I don't care if you play with me.

678
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:46.300
I'm talking about Prosecutor Seo. She went missing.

679
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.740
You can contact father right?

680
01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.340
Please tell him this.

681
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:57.820
If anything happens to Prosecutor Seo, I will never forgive him.

682
01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.060
Please. Persuade him, please.

683
01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.940
Please, hyung.

684
01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.120
That's why I told you not to mess with father!

685
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.200
Hyung, father has gone crazy. We need to catch him and stop him!

686
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.090
Please don't get swept away by him.

687
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:19.450
Joon Seo, you can't win father right now.

688
01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:21.000
Wait.

689
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.780
Wait calmly until I take all his power.

690
01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.450
You're going to beat father?

691
01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.070
The only way to beat him is to become him.

692
01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.010
You can't become him.

693
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.940
You can't become him, and you shouldn't become him.

694
01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.470
I will win.

695
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:43.170
I am not as weak as you think.

696
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:49.200
You live the life that father wants you to live.

697
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.780
That's the way for you to live.

698
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.270
<i> Hyung.</i>

699
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.180
Joon Seo, I have no thoughts of becoming father.

700
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:16.910
Because I am Jang Gi Seo.

701
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.690
I am me. Jang Gi Seo.

702
