00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.630
<i>Don't mess with Father.</i>

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.220
<i>Father is a monster.</i>

6
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.290
<i>A monster beyond your imagination.</i>

7
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.160
- Get in.
- There's no time.

8
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600
Team Leader, you need to go to the Bukcheon Police Station.

9
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.320
Bukcheon Police Station?

10
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.710
Weren't you on the same side as Jang Joon Seo?

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.420
I didn't know Jang Joon Seo killed Yoon Jung Hye.

12
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.790
He tricked me.

13
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.540
So, you're going to betray Jang Joon Seo?

14
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.000
My full-time job is as a policeman.

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.170
I want to hurry and come back to work. I don't want to be involved in Jang family's issues anymore.

16
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.450
Where is Jang Joon Seo right now?

17
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.560
<i>Untouchable
- Final Episode -</i>

18
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.360
Yes Boss. We've arrested him.

19
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.780
We will move to the station immediately. Yes.

20
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.490
Yes.

21
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.800
Noh Ji Hwan will report to Joo Tae Seop, the only person who is connected with Father.

22
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.330
Then Joo Tae Seop will definitely come out and ensure that I'm arrested.

23
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.060
What are you doing, you b*stard?

24
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.000
- What are you?
- It's me, you b*stards.

25
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.980
You b*stard!

26
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.040
Why so shocked? I told you I would treat you big time!

27
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.140
Th-This...

28
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.620
this is illegal!

29
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.690
I knocked you guys out, but I didn't take the gun.

30
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.560
It wasn't Goo Do Soo.

31
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.330
Joo Tae Seop went in there.

32
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.370
I think Prosecutor Seo will be in there.

33
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.310
Follow me.

34
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.190
Move.

35
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.000
Block them.

36
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.920
Move!

37
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.930
It doesn't matter who it is.

38
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.120
Block them. Block them you b*stards!

39
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360
You b*stard!

40
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.520
Check all their resources.

41
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.980
B*stard.

42
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.270
Detective Goo.

43
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.050
He went that way. Th-That way.

44
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.820
I'll be okay. Hurry and go catch him.

45
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.280
Detective Goo. Wake up! You can't lose consciousness!

46
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.460
Hey you punk! Goo Do Soo!

47
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.440
How is Detective Goo?

48
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.580
Fortunately, he isn't in a life-threatening situation. His breathing has also come back to normal.

49
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.300
He's normally a positive person, so he'll recover quickly.

50
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.880
By the way, what are you going to do now?

51
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.900
Even though Seo I Ra is a currently employed prosecutor, considering how they've been treating her...

52
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.570
Yes.

53
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.760
Hyung, hurry and come back to the scene.

54
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.960
If we look carefully, I think we can find where Prosecutor Seo is.

55
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.730
These b*stards filmed a video of the kidnapping and sent it here.

56
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.770
Where is this?

57
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.540
I'm not sure. I can't tell by the video.

58
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.460
Play it again.

59
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.900
Do you know where it is?

60
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.170
There is more than one place that looks like this in Bukcheon.

61
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.090
Play it again.

62
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.450
Wait, stop.

63
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.990
Excuse me.

64
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.750
Do you know where this is?

65
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.040
Ah, but this is an empty building.

66
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.140
Where is it?

67
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.560
Our info was wrong.

68
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.130
If they keep chasing after us, they'll catch our tail.

69
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.590
Hurry and take care of her.

70
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.250
Yes. I understand.

71
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.350
What are you doing? Hang her up.

72
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.530
Let's do this. Stop moving.

73
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.090
Stop moving.

74
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.030
- Grab her.
- Stop moving.

75
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.830
Stop!

76
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.820
Don't come near us.

77
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.920
I'm sorry.

78
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.480
I'm sorry.

79
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.100
Prosecutor Seo I Ra. Where is she?

80
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.700
Is she alive?

81
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.000
Was it Father's order?

82
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Yes.

83
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.800
Don't kill Prosecutor Seo I Ra. Even if it's Father's orders.

84
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.200
I just follow orders.

85
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.200
I told you not to do it. So don't!

86
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.800
I'm sorry. I only follow Jang Beom Ho's orders.

87
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.600
If Father says to kill me, will you kill me?

88
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.300
That won't happen.

89
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.200
Joon Seo will end Father. I know him.

90
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.100
Once he makes up his mind, he'll do it. Even if he'll die, he'll do it.

91
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.300
Father's generation will end now. Starting now, it's my generation.

92
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.800
Sorry, I have something urgent to deal with. I need to leave.

93
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.600
What is the urgent situation?

94
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.000
I'm sorry.

95
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.800
Are you going to kill someone again?

96
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.500
Tell me, you b*stard! Who is the person you're going to kill?

97
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.600
Is it Joon Seo?

98
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.200
I'll tell you after everything is finished.

99
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.310
Don't go.

100
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.800
I said not to go, you b*stard!

101
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.300
You b*stard.

102
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.730
Who did Father tell you to kill, you b*stard?

103
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:46.430
I can't tell you.

104
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.200
Bukcheon's owner is me!

105
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.300
It isn't Father!

106
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.600
I am Bukcheon's king.

107
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.700
I am, I am Bukcheon's king!

108
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.800
I am the king!

109
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.300
I am the king!

110
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.200
Hey.

111
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.500
Hey, you punk.

112
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.800
Hey, you punk!

113
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.300
Hey!

114
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.820
Are you okay not going to the hospital?

115
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.800
Don't step foot outside of your house, no matter what happens.

116
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:20.880
<i>You can't become Father. You aren't able to, and you can't.</i>

117
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.160
Joon Seo.

118
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.180
You were wrong.

119
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.100
Hyung.

120
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.800
Joon Seo.

121
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.410
I...

122
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.930
killed someone.

123
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.500
What are you saying? Who did you kill?

124
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.200
I hated Father as much as you did.

125
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.400
After seeing Father kill someone,

126
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.800
I realized he was wrong.

127
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.140
Even after you left,

128
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.600
I saw even more sides of him that proved he wasn't human.

129
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.400
I asked, who did you kill? Who?

130
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.800
Joon Seo.

131
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.990
I'm going to turn myself in.

132
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:18.500
I can become free from Father now, right?

133
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.070
Hyung.

134
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:25.300
<i>Do you know the reason why I stayed in that sickening house?</i>

135
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.920
I waited a long time for you.

136
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.730
For you to come back.

137
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.810
<i>When we were young,</i>

138
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:52.000
if Father was drunk, he'd buy a lot of food

139
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.300
and put it under our pillows. Do you remember?

140
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.620
<i>I believed that Father</i>

141
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:08.130
would turn back into the father who was nice to us.

142
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.400
So I thought we could have lived happily

143
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.060
when you came back.

144
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Where are you? I'll go to you.

145
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.100
No, no.

146
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.870
Don't come.

147
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.910
Find Father as you wanted.

148
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.690
And end the ill fate

149
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.600
between Father, me and you.

150
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.500
Joon Seo.

151
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.400
I really like you.

152
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.400
Hyung.

153
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.500
<i>We've captured Goo Ja Gyeong. We will follow your orders immediately.</i>

154
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.000
Yes.

155
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.800
<i>Who are you?</i> Who are you?!

156
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.000
What are you going to do, you punk!

157
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.800
Why?

158
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.300
What do we do? It's not Joo Tae Seop's voice.

159
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.200
We just have to follow the orders.

160
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.800
Do you guys know who I am?!

161
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.570
What the? What are you guys doing?

162
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.650
Ja Gyeong!

163
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.300
Ja Gyeong, are you okay?

164
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.710
Can you take your hand out?

165
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.240
Yes, Mother.

166
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.140

167
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:10.580
Um... I received a call from the hospital.

168
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.970
Gi Seo... got hurt.

169
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.140
What?

170
00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:24.870
I'm too scared to go. Could you go?

171
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.380
<i>No, it won't be Gi Seo.</i>

172
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.500
It'll be someone else.

173
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.130
I got it. Where's the hospital?

174
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.260
How's Hyung?

175
00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.410
I was right. It's not Gi Seo, right?

176
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.710
They mistook him for someone else, right?

177
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.580
Mother...

178
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.650
No...

179
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.340
No, there's no way it's Gi Seo.

180
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.760
No, there's no way.

181
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:26.310
Gi Seo is de...

182
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.970
No... no...

183
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.950
No, there's no way.

184
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.100
Why would Gi Seo die?

185
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.940
Why?

186
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.230
It's because of you. It's because of you.

187
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.760
It's because of you.

188
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:04.330
If you hadn't come back, there would be no reason for Gi Seo to die.

189
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:10.770
Bring him back. Bring Gi Seo back.

190
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:15.640
You can't do that to your brother. He did so much for you.

191
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:24.130
Even after you left, he always slept in your room

192
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.310
in case you came back at night.

193
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.500
To a brother like that...

194
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.980
You...

195
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:44.190
Get out. You said you were going to help your brother. You said you would help your brother.

196
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.180
Then why did you make him like this?

197
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.090
Gi Seo!

202
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:10.600
Dad... Father-in-law tried to kill me.

203
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:14.980
What?

204
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:29.500
Give everything you have to Jang Beom Ho.

205
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:35.200
That guy isn't human. Give everything back.

206
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.600
Tell him you were wrong and beg.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.000
That's how you can live, Ja Gyeong.

208
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.320
Dad.

209
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.170
Do you love me?

210
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.100
What are you saying?

211
00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:00.000
No... You don't love me.

212
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:09.000
In my whole life, I don't remember

213
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
anyone who loved me.

214
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.200
But...

215
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:21.090
without me knowing,

216
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.830
there was someone

217
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.400
who loved me.

218
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.200
That person died.

219
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.800
Will there ever be someone who loves me that much again?

220
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.100
Dad...

221
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.730
I'm in so much pain.

222
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:19.400
It hurts so much, I can't get over it.

223
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.000
Who died?

224
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.100
Dad...

225
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:43.400
I want to live as that person's wife. I want to live as the wife

226
00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.700
of the only person who loved me.

227
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.600
Ja Gyeong... Was it...

228
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.600
Gi Seo?

229
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.100
Dad, you can give up on me too.

230
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.700
I don't want to be your daughter anymore.

231
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.300
What are you going to do?

232
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.900
I have to go to Heugryeongdo, where my father is.

233
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.720
While I was alone in my room, I thought a lot about you.

234
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:39.100
Even if someone kills a person, families will inevitably get behind that person.

235
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:46.400
But why did you chase after your father until this point?

236
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.200
There were definitely a lot of chances for you to embrace your father's crimes.

237
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.200
If you did that, no one would have cursed at you.

238
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:04.400
And why did my mom have to report my father for his crime?

239
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.900
Do people think that the one's who report their own family members

240
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:16.100
did the right thing? Do they think they're good people?

241
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.160
I'm not a good person.

242
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.990
I don't want to be a good person either.

243
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:31.300
That's how my father raised me. Only the strongest lives.

244
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:39.100
As I learned from my father, I want to beat my father and become the strongest.

245
00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.000
I told the members of the Bukcheon committee, so they're going to head there.

246
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.800
Just show them the information you got from that room.

247
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.000
Yes.

248
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.410
No. I'm going to Heugryeongdo alone.

249
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.200
I'm going to take you to Heugryeongdo.

250
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.000
Gi Seo died. Father killed him.

251
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.200
I'm sorry about that. I'm regretting the things I couldn't stop him from doing.

252
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:58.900
Now, I'm unable to and can't forgive him.

<i>A special report by the Seoul Prosecutors Office has revealed that former president Goo Yong Chan...<i></i></i>

254

255

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.800
<i>involved in an intimate relationship. </i>

258
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.400
<i>In order to protect Goo Ja Gyeong's safety...</i>

259
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.600
<i>the Central Prosecutor's Office has sent a team to Bukcheon City.</i>

260
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Hey, it looks like Goo Yong Chan and Goo Ja Gyeong are both going down.

261
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.900
Did you do it?

262
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.200
No. Goo Ja Gyeong did it herself.

263
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.000
Well that's that. Gi Seo died as well.

264
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.200
If Goo Yong Chan and Goo Ja Gyeong disappear too,

265
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:53.600
as you said, don't we become 1st place in Bukcheon?

266
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.400
Father, if Goo Ja Gyeong gets arrested, I will get arrested too.

267
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.400
My name is in that recording.

268
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.800
What? You'll get arrested too?

269
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:22.000
Father, please tell them that I didn't know anything, and I just did what you told me to do.

270
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.600
Tell them you were threatened by Goo Yong Chan and used your unknowing son.

271
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.000
What, you punk?

272
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.200
Father, you tell them that. You have to make a sacrifice for your son.

273
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.100
That's what a real father does.

274
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.700
Where is Father?

275
00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.860

<i>Let us work so we can answer them boldly.</i>

282

<i>We are the warriors of our proud Bukcheon.</i>

291
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:41.600
You were all being watched through these 24/7.

292
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.600
The drivers, secretaries, the subordinates you all trusted in...

293
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.800
were the people who were watching you all.

294
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.100
Who would do this?

295
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.800
The person you all trusted and treated like a god...

296
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.900
Jang Beom Ho.

297
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.200
Jang Beom Ho has passed away. It was just a fabricated rumour.

298
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.000
There is someone who saw Jang Beom Ho alive.

299
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.700
It was Prosecutor Seo I Ra from the Bukcheon Prosecutor's Office.

300
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:26.220
Just because she saw Jang Beom Ho alive, he kidnapped her.

301
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.600
What happened to Prosecutor Seo?

302
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.300
We saved her just before she was killed.

303
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.600
<i>I need to head over to the second phase of Yong Hank Soo's trial. Could you please organize the documents to submit to the judges?<i></i></i>

304
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.500
<i>It's information that Yoon Jung Hye personally gave to Goo Ja Gyeong</i>

305
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:53.200
<i>If we can connect Yoon Jung Hye's murder with the disappearance of the officers from three years ago, we should have enough to obtain a search warrant for Heukryeongdo.</i>

306
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.700
That means he planted people at the Prosecutor's office as well.

307
00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:02.700
Yes. This video is the reason Jang Beom Ho was going to kill Goo Ja Gyeong,

308
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.300
but in turn killed Jang Gi Seo.

309
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.400
Jang Beom Ho is currently at Heugryeongdo.

310
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:15.400
Chief Prosecutor Ji, Prosecutor Seo I Ra is your staff.

311
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.200
Jang Beom Ho has abducted and attempted to kill a present Prosecutor.

312
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.000
Isn't this a sufficient reason to arrest Jang Beom Ho?

313
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.370
It's me.

314
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.600
There should be some documents in Prosecutor Seo I Ra's office that she received from an external source. Check those.

315
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.700
Contact all the police officers in our jurisdiction and have them prepare to send a team to Heukryeongdo.

316
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:18.540
<i>Because of you, I lost the only chance for me to be free from my father.</i>

317
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.490
<i>This was my last chance.</i>

318
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:34.890
<i>Do you know how hard it is for someone like me to gather courage to die?</i>

319
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.510
<i>This time, you did wrong.</i>

320
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.970
<i>You can't leave me by myself.</i>

321
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.460
Go check that side.

322
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.780
Hurry and call an ambulance!

323
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.540
<i>Education makes people stronger.</i>

324
00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:46.960
<i>It perfects people to respect correction, order, and teamwork.</i>

325
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.110
<i>Throw away all the wrongs you committed in the past.</i>

326
00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:55.850
<i>You must become a valuable human being for Bukcheon who can work hard putting your life on the line.</i>

327
00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:00.560
<i>For Bukcheoh, we'll give up our lives...</i>

328
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.370
I am trash. I am trash.

329
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:09.970
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

330
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:20.950
It's that room at the end. Your father is waiting for you.

331
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.690
No, this isn't something Chief Noh Ji Hwan can stop.

332
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.070
Contact everyone and tell them to hide until they die.

333
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.530
This is my final order.

334
00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:01.280
Who in the world are you, Father?

335
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.560
Didn't you see?

336
00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:10.260
This Heugryeongdo and I, are the history of our Jang family.

337
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.180
This place?

338
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:19.600
This place? This hell? You called me here to show me this hell?

339
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:26.470
Your grandfather was a brave soldier for Imperial Japan.

340
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:31.630
He fought for our country during the Pacific War and returned.

341
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:36.980
And he built an empire for himself here.

342
00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:41.210
That great mentality is still alive today.

343
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.590
Bukcheon became the Bukcheon it is now, because of that mindset.

344
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:49.800
Bukcheon, is a world that the Bukcheon citizens made themselves.

345
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.270
You stood on top of that while sucking the blood out of them.

346
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:58.110
Humans are selfish beasts.

347
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:02.260
Unless someone rules over them from the top...

348
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:08.710
I'm sure it would've become chaotic because of all those criminals who are like animals.

349
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:15.430
So... in order to rule over those humans who are like animals...

350
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.640
Did you live with such a rotten thinking in your heart?

351
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:26.540
I have to protect what is right. I can't lose that mindset even if 100 years pass by.

352
00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:32.090
To pass on your grandfather and my mindset,

353
00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:35.140
we made Bukcheon into a city without crime.

354
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.350
We made it into the best city in the Republic of Korea.

355
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:43.060
No. You made Bukcheon into a rotten city.

356
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.660
You created people who are crazy about power.

357
00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:50.560
That's why powerful people who are lawless and unethical came about.

358
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.900
Father, you made Bukcheon rot from the bottom to the top.

359
00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.720
Joon Seo.

360
00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:03.230
Please throw that mindset away.

361
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.410
The reason I'm showing you this place

362
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:12.170
is because I think of you as my heir.

363
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:16.980
You're telling me to become your heir?

364
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:22.690
You trick your family because you're scared you'll lose your power.

365
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.220
You even killed your son's wife afraid that she might be an obstacle.

366
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:31.100
You even killed detectives who were after your secret. And now...

367
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.640
And now you killed your own son.

368
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.380
You're telling me to be the heir of someone like that?

369
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:46.970
If you can't understand all this, you won't be able to get out of here.

370
00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.690
Father.

371
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.410
Are you really my father?

372
00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:03.180
I can give up everything for the bigger goal.

373
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:11.020
Father... Your goal that makes you believe that you're the only one who is right... That's what killed Gi Seo.

374
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:16.560
Father, you don't make humans into humans, you make humans into beasts.

375
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.480
And you yourself have also become a beast.

376
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.660
Gi Seo! He's not qualified to become a leader!

377
00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:30.440
A guy who throws away his life over a girl can't become a leader!

378
00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:35.680
That's right, it could be good for Bukcheon.

379
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:42.980
You made him like that. You did! You need to be punished.

380
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:49.370
Who do you think will be able to punish me? Who?

381
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.320
I will.

382
00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:59.310
I, who inherited your blood. Jang Joon Seo.

383
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.200
Okay.

384
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:16.270
If you can do it, then you should.

385
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:23.140
You, are my only remaining son.

386
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.560
If it's what you want,

387
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.180
At last...

388
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.730
Go.

389
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.070
This is to protect yourself.

390
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:09.850
It's over. Father and our family's history.

391
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:19.980
He doesn't know anything! He has no idea what the big picture is!

392
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:30.620
Sir, The police will arrive at Heugryeongdo soon.

393
00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.110
It won't be possible to deal with this time.

394
00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:38.280
How dare the police come?

395
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:50.860
I am not Jang Beom Ho.

396
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.130
I am God.

397
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:56.200
I will serve you in hell.

398
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:03.020
I will never die.

399
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.610
<i>We are warriors of our proud Bukcheon!</i>

400
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:35.310
Jang Beom Ho snuck out criminals to Heugryeongdo using No Ji Hwan and Park Tae Jin who were police officers at the time.

401
00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:39.360
He trained those criminals in Heugryeongdo and turned them into his minions.

402
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:45.430
And he kept a watch on numerous people using those minions and ruled over Bukcheon.

403
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:51.610
However, the resources they used to monitor the people have become the evidence of their crimes.

404
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:53.940
Please watch the monitor.

405
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:59.310
<i>I took care of Jang Gi Cheol. But the problem is the Chief Jung Yoon Mi.</i>

406
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:04.930
<i>I think she's thinking of sending detectives over to Heugryeongdo.</i>

407
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:06.730
<i>What should we do?</i>

408
00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:09.710
<i>Team Leader Yoon Dong Pil has also talked to me.</i>

409
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:12.820
<i>He told me to go to Heugryeongdo with him.</i>

410
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.880
<i>Tell him you'll go with him.</i>

411
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:21.990
<i>And no matter what you have to say as an excuse,
get yourself out of it. Then, we'll take care of their deaths as accidental.</i>

412
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:28.760
<i>You have to become a witness to prove that they died from an accident.</i>

413
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.770
September 26, 2014, around 9 p.m...

414
00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:41.740
Jang Gi Cheol who was on the Wanted List escapes Heugryeongdo.

415
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.390
He wanted to come to the police station and tell them about Heugryeongdo's secret.

416
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:50.070
But No Ji Hwan who was the intelligent officer at the time murders Jang Gi Cheol.

417
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:56.060
And soon after, four detectives including Yoon Dong Pil who were after Heugryeongdo's secret...

418
00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.660
head over to Heugryeongdo.

419
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.530

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.420
That is all.

421
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:11.720
Defendant Park Tae Jin, Noh Ji Hwan.

422
00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.230
Do you admit your crimes?

423
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.420
Defendant Yong Hak Soo.

424
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.250
Yes.

425
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:30.020
Yoon Dong Pil, Yoo Soo Hyeong, Kim Jin Ha, Choi Byeong Ho and Yoon Dong Pil's daughter, Yoon Jung Hye.

426
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:36.950
Do you admit that you received orders from Jang Beom Ho to kill these people?

427
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:42.950
Everything was done out of my own judgement.

428
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:47.610
It was a result of our extreme loyalty toward Mayor Jang Beom Ho.

429
00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.290
He did nothing wrong.

430
00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:03.250
He's someone who lived his entire life for Bukcheon.

431
00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:11.290
And to protect his own honour, he took his own life.

Jae Ho, your wife isn't threatening to leave you anymore?

Hyung, I'm someone with an apartment in Gangnam.

If there's someone in the police force with an apartment in Gangnam, tell them to come out.

Don't be careless.

459
00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:33.230
The second hardest occupation in this world is a police, and the first one is a police's wife.

460
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.960
She could've changed the title on the house without your knowledge.

461
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.860
No way. How could she change the title on it without my permission?

462
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.190
Of course, that's illegal.

463
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.730
If you say it's illegal, doesn't that mean it's possible?

464
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:49.830
That's right. The easiest thing to do is something illegal.

465
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:55.070
You... you were disciplined for taking bribes, yet you still haven't come to your senses yet.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:19.420
On the contrary, someone like me who lives illegal lifestyle protects justice in this country.

473
01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.170
Besides, you caught a robber recently...

474
01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.820
and you let him go because you felt sorry for him. Isn't that illegal, too?

475
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.170
That and this... it's diff...

476
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:30.130
Hold on.

477
01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:35.000
Was it you? The one who tattle-tailed on me to the chief?

478
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.030
We're a team. We should drink together and get punished together.

479
01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:42.810
Hey, don't you know I have a promotion evaluation next month?

480
01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:45.970
Don't go up too high up on the ladder. I'll feel too distant from you.

481
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:47.570
Geez, that mouth of yours...

482
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:50.530
-Hyung, that...
-<i>I believe the outcome of this trial was a given.</i>

483
01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.770
Isn't that Prosecutor Seo?

484
01:00:53.770 --> 01:01:00.160
<i>This will be a turning point where all the illegally possessed land that is supposed to be under the ownership of the government will be returned.</i>
<i>[ Prosecutors' Office wins, Bukcheon expo land returned to government ]</i>

485
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.360
<i>And also, a traitor from the past...</i>

486
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.500
<i>The contradictory reality where his descendants are prospering...</i>

487
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.570
<i>I wish this would be a turning point that would flip things around.</i>

488
01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:10.150
She's doing well. She's even appearing on TV.

489
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:11.590
Hm?

490
01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:14.430
If she comes out on TV, she is a star prosecutor now.

491
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:20.330
Hyung, are you still being a bad guy to Prosecutor Seo?

492
01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:23.580
Now, let's all drink!

493
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.790
We got together after a long time, today we will see the end of it.

494
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:31.790
Cheers, cheers cheers!

495
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:39.370
<i>Bukcheon Mayor
Jung Yoon Mi</i>

496
01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:44.840
There are rumours that Vice President Jang Gyu Ho is preparing to run in the next mayoral election.

497
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.760
Did you know?

498
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.400
It's my first time hearing that.

499
01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.390
If you want to continue on, you can't ignore it.

500
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:58.720
He goes around saying that he's former Mayor Jang Beom Ho's heir.

501
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:05.340
There are still a lot of people in Bukcheon who support Jang Beom Ho.

502
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:13.310
We have to avoid letting Jang Beom Ho's spirit come back into Bukcheon.

503
01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:16.690
I will stop him from becoming the mayor.

504
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:22.070
That's right. The person who can stop such a tragedy from repeating itself is...

505
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:27.640
There's only Mayor Jung Yoon Mi in Bukcheon.

506
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.810
Shall I teach you?

507
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.590
-Go in the center.
-Center.

508
01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:13.190
Find your balance, in the center.

509
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.860
-That's right, that's right.
-Okay.

510
01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.270
-Okay, okay.
-Okay, okay.

511
01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.110
Okay! Okay, okay!

512
01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:19.790
-In the center.
-In the center.

513
01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:22.120
-You're doing well.
-Ok, ok.

514
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.790
I'm doing well.

515
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.410
I'm doing well.

516
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:32.180
