WEBVTT

1
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.780
(Romantic master Choi Bool Am...)

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.240
(came like the first snow.)

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.450
(Sleeping mission with the master became more intense.)

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.610
(Matching pajama)

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.420
(Foot washing, lullaby)

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.889
(Who will get to sleep with the master today?)

7
00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.759
(Those who want to avoid sleeping with the master,)

8
00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.829
(bear the coldness.)

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.930
(Is it going to be Yang Se Hyeong?)

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.960
I'm sorry, but can we not change?

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.700
- Here we go! 1, 2, 3! - 1, 2...

12
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.939
(Sang Yun's great rebellion)

13
00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:40.139
I can't play another round of this.

14
00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.370
(The crowd is disturbed.)

15
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.639
(As a result, Sang Yun goes on his knees.)

16
00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:45.840
(Sang Yun's effort...)

17
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.910
(to go back to square one)

18
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.679
(Will the sleeping battle...)

19
00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.120
(enter a new phase?)

20
00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:59.629
- Then now... - It's no joke.

21
00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.590
You two can decide.

22
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.529
No. All four of us should do it.

23
00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.730
Right. All of us should do it.

24
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.629
- You won. - Then you...

25
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.900
- Seong Jae. Let me be clear. - You couldn't do it for 52 seconds.

26
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.909
When someone does something wrong in the game,

27
00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.040
we start over.

28
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.109
(When something goes wrong in the game, we start over.)

29
00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.109
Right.

30
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.279
- Right. - Hey, Seung Gi.

31
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.950
- I'm not arguing. - Right.

32
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.249
It'll be no fun if just two of us decide it.

33
00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:26.889
- Right. - Then it's invalid.

34
00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:28.320
It's not invalid.

35
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.859
You cheated on your will.

36
00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.590
But I confessed on my will.

37
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.630
(But I confessed on my will.)

38
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.630
What?

39
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.130
- You be quiet. - It evens out.

40
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.829
- It's even. - He's right.

41
00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.600
That's not right. It's nonsense.

42
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.439
When I got up at 52 seconds,

43
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.279
the first thing came to my mind wasn't brushing off the snow,

44
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.109
but telling you to get up.

45
00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.450
Do you know why? Because you might be struggling.

46
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.510
But we promised to do that.

47
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.120
- You're right, but... - That was the rule.

48
00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.919
I could go for longer. I can do it for three minutes.

49
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.120
If you do it for three minutes, I'll do it all.

50
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.159
I'm serious. If you do it for three minutes,

51
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.329
- It's a figure of speech. - you take my pay for this week.

52
00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.930
I don't need anything, so do whatever you want.

53
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.760
Okay. I get it.

54
00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.200
Okay. I'm doing you a huge favor this time.

55
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.940
You need to know we're giving you a chance.

56
00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.510
Accept it. Just accept it.

57
00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.079
It's not that hard.

58
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.440
(Is he going to compromise?)

59
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.810
- Think about it. - Whatever. It's over.

60
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.720
(Break down due to time out)

61
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720
- Okay. - Wait.

62
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.049
Fine. Let's just say you're doing me a favor.

63
00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.049
(Let's just say you're doing me a favor.)

64
00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.619
- Done. - Happy? Let's just say that.

65
00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.720
- We're even. - Okay. We're settled.

66
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.760
- Okay. - We're settled.

67
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.829
- Don't ever do that again. - Okay.

68
00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.160
- Why did you do that? - You shouldn't do that to me.

69
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.799
- Do what? - Do what?

70
00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.200
(What's he talking about?)

71
00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.570
You keep deceiving me.

72
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.339
That's for fun, but this almost killed us.

73
00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:52.500
- It was for fun. - What?

74
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.540
- We never threatened your life. - This almost killed us.

75
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.810
(It was for fun.)

76
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.609
(We never threatened your life.)

77
00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.780
- It's so noisy. - Fine. Okay.

78
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.480
- Then you see how white it is? - Yes.

79
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.820
(A new game to pick the bed mate fairly)

80
00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.589
Let's stand in line exactly.

81
00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.489
If we jump, our steps will be evident.

82
00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.760
- Good. - That's good.

83
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.260
- See? - That's great.

84
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.060
- Standing jump? - Standing jump...

85
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.630
Let's do it 1 by 1.

86
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.769
(It records on white snow. It will be a perfectly fair play.)

87
00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.100
- Gosh. - Let's do it.

88
00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:24.669
What's your height?

89
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.109
- It doesn't matter though. - You're 180cm. What about you?

90
00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.540
- 182cm. - What about you?

91
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.839
- 185cm. - I'm 137cm tall.

92
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.579
- Did you say 137cm? - If I do it here,

93
00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.709
the longest I can jump is 1m.

94
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.320
We're doing you a big favor.

95
00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.519
I said we're even.

96
00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.320
- Listen. - Can I stay out for a minute?

97
00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.760
- Let's jump from there. - No.

98
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.060
- It's fair. - It's not.

99
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.429
Choose.

100
00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.429
I don't want to do it.

101
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.730
Let's just go. Let's go please.

102
00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.329
Please.

103
00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.369
(It's hard to settle down with them being so competitive.)

104
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.040
Then let's measure it...

105
00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.570
not by the first step,

106
00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.410
but by the end of your arm.

107
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.839
(Let's measure up to arms instead of the first step.)

108
00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.010
That's even more dangerous.

109
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.410
(Oh, that doesn't work for me.)

110
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.679
That's worse. Let's just jump.

111
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.149
Then Seong Jae can't do it.

112
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:09.880
He endured it. We should leave him.

113
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.250
He needs to watch out for his waist.

114
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.350
- Sure. - Okay?

115
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.589
- That's better. - Okay.

116
00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:15.950
- Okay. - Let's do a jump.

117
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.619
How's your blood pressure?

118
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.130
I take medicine.

119
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.159
I've been taking medicine for blood pressure for over 10 years now.

120
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.729
It's good that you're still healthy.

121
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.800
I'm not.

122
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.370
He still drinks seven bottles of soju.

123
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.870
- Goodness. - Still.

124
00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.539
I still drink 2 or 3 bottles.

125
00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.139
(Index for being healthy is about how much he can drink.)

126
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.550
It's hot.

127
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.709
(It's snowing so much.)

128
00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:43.279
Jump to sleep with the master.

129
00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.219
- Let's jump around here. - Okay.

130
00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:48.089
I'll put the towel here.

131
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.120
We can't jump from the same place anyway.

132
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.420
- Give me one more towel. - Okay.

133
00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.289
- It's not easy to move. - I know.

134
00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:58.159
You never know because of snow.

135
00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:00.769
You might fall before jumping.

136
00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:01.800
It's hollow inside.

137
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.800
It's cold. It's freezing.

138
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.510
I feel like my feet are going to rip.

139
00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:11.209
(When their feet feel like ripping...)

140
00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:13.050
- For every game. - He's taking his clothes off.

141
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.279
(Seung Gi tears his clothes.)

142
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.810
Here I go.

143
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.519
(Not even the heavy snow can clam Seung Gi down.)

144
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.789
(No one can stop him.)

145
00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:23.820
(Lee Seung Gi)

146
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.360
(He's ready.)

147
00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:28.329
I think he's going to jump really far.

148
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.260
(I'm going to jump far.)

149
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.969
(I'm going to jump really far.)

150
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:36.969
You have to wear matching pajama, wash his feet...

151
00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.039
and sing a lullaby before going to sleep.

152
00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:42.209
Go.

153
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.010
Go.

154
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.320
(He jumped as if someone poked his butt...)

155
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.990
(to avoid sleeping with the master.)

156
00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.289
(How will he do it?)

157
00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:09.430
(Light)

158
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.440
Okay.

159
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.909
- Good. - Okay.

160
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.209
- How is it? - He jumped really far.

161
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.110
Okay.

162
00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:24.820
(Seung Gi)

163
00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.190
(It's perfect.)

164
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.320
- It's here. - He jumped far.

165
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.159
He jumped far.

166
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.630
I should've gone further. I should've bent my knees.

167
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.089
(No one can stop Seung Gi.)

168
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.560
- Who's next? - Me.

169
00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:38.930
Okay.

170
00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:40.300
Is everyone taking their clothes off?

171
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.639
Really?

172
00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.639
(Se Hyeong also takes off clothes just as Seung Gi did)

173
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.639
Hey.

174
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.079
(I was fair.)

175
00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:01.320
(I did it for everyone.)

176
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.320
(But return to that,)

177
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.729
(all I got was Seung Gi's attack and conciliation.)

178
00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:11.200
(And he chose long jump as if he was targeting me.)

179
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.469
(That's a game that two can play, Lee Seung Gi.)

180
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.539
(When I jump less than 2.2m, which is Seung Gi's record,)

181
00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.810
(I'm going to burn in fire.)

182
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:29.149
Hurry up.

183
00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:34.190
He looks so desperate.

184
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.950
Hurry up.

185
00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.289
Number two, Yang Se Hyeong. Start.

186
00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:45.060
(Hotter than Seung Gi)

187
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.880
(He jumped!)

188
00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.680
(Did he jump...)

189
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.690
(farther?)

190
00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:19.099
(Ouch)

191
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.870
(Collapsed)

192
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.610
(Not only his face,)

193
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.209
(his body is stuck deep in the snow.)

194
00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:33.380
Shoot, I'm doomed.

195
00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:36.450
(Laughing hard)

196
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.979
(Bursting out laughing)

197
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.060
(Shoot, I'm doomed.)

198
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.430
(He likes it so much.)

199
00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.129
What shall I do?

200
00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.599
You tripped over.

201
00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:55.400
(Tripping on branches,)

202
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.869
(Se Hyeong lost his center of gravity.)

203
00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:03.009
(Then, he fell over on the snowed ground.)

204
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.680
(Mingled with joy and sorrow)

205
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.190
It was here. Your record is here.

206
00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:14.320
It's over.

207
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.650
He tripped over this.

208
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.989
Can I just jump in place?

209
00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:19.190
It doesn't matter. It's up to you.

210
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.430
I think I can reach there by jumping in place.

211
00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:25.660
I don't think so, Sang Yun.

212
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800
I don't think so, Sang Yun.

213
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.070
(3rd player, Lee Sang Yun, 185cm)

214
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.099
Here...

215
00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:38.739
Both Sang Yun and Se Hyeong insisted that the game was invalid.

216
00:09:39.849 --> 00:09:41.780
Right. It'll be a tie then.

217
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.589
(I helped him to make it a tie, but Sang Yun is hurting my pride.)

218
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.619
(This is why it's said you shouldn't help others thoughtlessly.)

219
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.160
(Without a warm-up,)

220
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.629
He doesn't have to go so far.

221
00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:55.660
(he jumped.)

222
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.700
(Without run-up,)

223
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.499
(he jumped!)

224
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.609
(Who's going to sleep with their master tonight?)

225
00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:19.420
(Even if he jumped in place,)

226
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.450
(he jumped farther than Se Hyeong did.)

227
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.450
So, Se Hyeong is sleeping with our master!

228
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.489
(Sighing)

229
00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:28.030
Se Hyeong is sleeping with our master!

230
00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:32.030
(Se Hyeong gets to sleep with the master.)

231
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.329
(There was...)

232
00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:35.400
(no twist.)

233
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.070
(Sang Yun... Seung Gi...)

234
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.739
I knew this coming since you asked too many things.

235
00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:43.040
It's so cold.

236
00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:46.450
I'm okay. I'm fine.

237
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.749
(Sang Yun takes out a hand warmer, feeling sorry.)

238
00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:50.150
It's not even hot at all.

239
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.719
It's not a help at all.

240
00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.489
- Let's go. - I'm looking forward to tonight.

241
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:59.219
(The long and cold battle even to freeze the hand warmer.)

242
00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:01.060
Who said to do this? Actually, I did it.

243
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.959
Yes!

244
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.670
(To tell the news that Se Hyeong is the one...)

245
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.499
(to sleep with him, they're going to the master.)

246
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.940
- Are you staying in shape? - Yes.

247
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.969
Do you work out?

248
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.369
- And are you eating well too? - Yes, I am.

249
00:11:15.969 --> 00:11:18.079
- Master. - We're back, Master.

250
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.849
You came back?

251
00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.410
Gosh, you became snowmen.

252
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.050
Knock the snow off on your head. You might be freezing.

253
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.050
(The reason why...)

254
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.989
(they became snowmen is...)

255
00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:32.420
(because of sleeping together with the master.)

256
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.290
(You'll never know.)

257
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.599
Master, there's something we'll tell you.

258
00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:41.400
At outside, we wanted to have memories together.

259
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.070
And we picked someone for tonight.

260
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.209
He's going to sleep with you, do massages for you,

261
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.479
tell you a story, and even sing a lullaby for you.

262
00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:52.839
Someone's going to enter my room?

263
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.820
Yes. There's someone who really wants to sleep with you.

264
00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:00.390
I wish no one sleeps in my room.

265
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.820
(I wish no one sleeps in my room.)

266
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.660
(Hmm)

267
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.660
(Sighing)

268
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.700
- Did someone get to do it? - Yes.

269
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.829
That person won't bother you.

270
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:16.999
But, that person is going to sing a lullaby until I go asleep?

271
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.369
- Well... - If you want...

272
00:12:18.369 --> 00:12:19.969
I've been to military service before.

273
00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:21.839
Someone was told to sing a lullaby.

274
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280
But...

275
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.979
(But?)

276
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.079
(Gulping)

277
00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:33.290
- I wanted to kill him. - I see.

278
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.390
(I see.)

279
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.459
- I heard the singing. - Yes.

280
00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:43.359
(Although it's a joke...)

281
00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:45.300
Right. Singing a lullaby is too much.

282
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.629
Right. In the military service...

283
00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:49.640
- I know. - they make people do such things.

284
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.700
Singing a lullaby...

285
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.900
(Singing a lullaby can be difficult, Se Hyeong.)

286
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.810
Before then, there's an important thing.

287
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.040
Where are we sleeping tonight? It's so snowy outside.

288
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.109
Right. We need to decide where to sleep.

289
00:12:58.109 --> 00:13:00.410
Come to my place.

290
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.709
No. Come to mine.

291
00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.420
You don't need to go far away.

292
00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:05.450
Just stay here.

293
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.320
But these guys have to eat and sleep.

294
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.550
- Hold on. - Can we sleep here?

295
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.560
My place has heated floors and they need a warm place to stay.

296
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.629
- You can stay... - They all...

297
00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:17.759
want us to stay in their places.

298
00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:20.070
Then, how about telling us what your places like?

299
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.599
Tell us about your places.

300
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:23.140
Well...

301
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.239
my place have furnace to heat the house.

302
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.810
It's a flat stone heating the floor.

303
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.040
It functions similarly as Korean dry sauna.

304
00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:32.879
Functioning like Korean dry sauna?

305
00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:35.379
In this kind of weather, it's best to get yourself warm.

306
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.820
(Making a diversion)

307
00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:38.719
- Weigh it well. - Okay.

308
00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:39.989
(It's best to get yourself warm. Weigh it well.)

309
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.089
The thing is the house is warm, but he has families at home.

310
00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:46.690
- That's a thing to consider. - I guess that can be a problem.

311
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.729
We might disturb them.

312
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.329
(It's okay...)

313
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:53.369
First, our house also has good heating system.

314
00:13:53.369 --> 00:13:56.129
(Of course we have the heating system too.)

315
00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:58.369
And we have good drinks too.

316
00:13:58.499 --> 00:13:59.810
You mean alcohol?

317
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.040
And since you got snowed on,

318
00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.239
it's better to move in a short distance.

319
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.650
How many minutes does it take on foot?

320
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:11.349
Around 30 steps?

321
00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:12.650
30 steps?

322
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.089
It's just here then.

323
00:14:14.089 --> 00:14:16.390
(It's just around the corner.)

324
00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:18.190
The house looked good.

325
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.560
(Liu Bei's house is in best location.)

326
00:14:21.329 --> 00:14:23.859
When you come to our house,

327
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.759
we have much more drinks.

328
00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:29.129
(We have much more drinks.)

329
00:14:29.499 --> 00:14:31.999
And you can use the house by yourself.

330
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.270
I have no families.

331
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.140
We'll be guaranteed to have a separate space.

332
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.479
That's right.

333
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.810
That sounds good.

334
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:43.079
And you can sing and have fun there.

335
00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:44.079
We also have a karaoke.

336
00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:46.950
(Zhang Fei's house has the karaoke system.)

337
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.050
- That's not the point. - He's checking him.

338
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.459
(That's not the point.)

339
00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:52.459
(According to Liu Bei, Zhang Fei's place has a karaoke room.)

340
00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:55.430
It's not a karaoke room. It just has a karaoke machine.

341
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.329
- I mean... - That was the only good condition.

342
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.160
- karaoke machine is... - Take off your hand.

343
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.770
(Quarreling)

344
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.800
You don't call a karaoke machine room, but a karaoke room.

345
00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.140
When you have wills and desires,

346
00:15:05.969 --> 00:15:07.009
come to my place.

347
00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.369
- When we have wills and desires... - His place sounds great.

348
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.680
I'm so torn.

349
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.910
Come to my place when you have wills and desires.

350
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.709
Don't just do it that way. Do as you want.

351
00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:15.950
- Let's go to my place. - Since you're here,

352
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.550
(Guan Yu is appealing by pushful physical touch.)

353
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.050
You don't have to go far. Just stay here at my place.

354
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.619
Since you're here, I'll let you stay at an unshared house.

355
00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.959
I already emptied three rooms.

356
00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:31.099
(Because of the older brother's big shouting,)

357
00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:32.599
(Zhang Fei's eyes look anxious.)

358
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.469
They're very competitive.

359
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.400
- Then... - Guan Yu...

360
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.140
You used to look after me in usual.

361
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.810
In this situation, there's no more concessions.

362
00:15:47.349 --> 00:15:49.249
We all heard what you've got.

363
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.520
For a minute or so, we'll have some discussions.

364
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.150
All right. Take your time.

365
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.719
- Are you done talking? - Yes.

366
00:15:55.719 --> 00:15:57.359
- Then, we'll... - All right.

367
00:15:57.359 --> 00:15:59.020
Well...

368
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.829
This is the moment to make a choice.

369
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.690
Before we begin,

370
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.530
we'll tell you all your conditions were good.

371
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:09.099
I think it'll be better not to disturb your families.

372
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.839
Hooray!

373
00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:16.310
Thank you for having us tonight.

374
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.749
You don't need to. I thank you. Thank you for choosing me.

375
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.219
He's saying he's thankful for visiting his house.

376
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.589
You can only find such generous offers in paradise.

377
00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:30.959
You're right.

378
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.959
- It's snowing a lot. - I love to see the snow.

379
00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:37.430
It's beautiful.

380
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.930
Is it snowing hard?

381
00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.129
It's snowing hard. There are more snow flurries now.

382
00:16:42.729 --> 00:16:43.940
(The disaster alert goes off.)

383
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.940
This is an emergency.

384
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.410
We can't go home.

385
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.670
(It's frozen everywhere. Extreme cold wave hits Gangwon Province.)

386
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.280
(Gangwon Province is nearly minus 30°C.)

387
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.349
(On top of the cold wave, there's a snow storm.)

388
00:16:56.479 --> 00:16:57.680
It's snowing so much.

389
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.690
(The sun set, and the night fell in no time.)

390
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:03.119
- Let's walk slowly. - Yes.

391
00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:04.119
(They face the creepiness of Gangwon Province's nature.)

392
00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.790
What kind of a weather is this?

393
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.359
It's cold.

394
00:17:07.989 --> 00:17:10.299
- What if we can't go up? - What is this?

395
00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:12.059
(Because of the snow storm, they can't move by car.)

396
00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:13.630
The snow is hitting my brain.

397
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.269
(For their safety, they will walk to the house.)

398
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.670
This is torture.

399
00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:23.880
It's snowing way too much.

400
00:17:24.239 --> 00:17:26.140
I have to check the camera.

401
00:17:26.209 --> 00:17:28.509
- The screen is gone. - I will quickly check the camera.

402
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.950
Right now,

403
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:37.059
we are on our way to Mr. Zhang Fei's house.

404
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.759
It's an uphill, and it's snowing very hard.

405
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.559
So we can't take a car.

406
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.830
We have to walk up for about 20 minutes.

407
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.340
(The survival diary continues.)

408
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.410
It seems like...

409
00:17:54.569 --> 00:17:57.009
we are stranded in this snowy mountain.

410
00:18:00.249 --> 00:18:01.680
The snowcapped mountain is ever-so white.

411
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.450
So why does it feel...

412
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.090
like our future is dark?

413
00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:12.489
It feels like we're really stranded in the mountain,

414
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.890
looking for a shelter.

415
00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:19.029
It really feels like Mount Everest.

416
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:20.029
(Is this a survival variety show?)

417
00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:25.940
We are nearly there. Hang in there.

418
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.209
(Law of the Master)

419
00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:30.580
At this age, it's really tough to climb.

420
00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:33.150
I'm tired too,

421
00:18:34.249 --> 00:18:36.549
but you're older than me, so you must be more tired.

422
00:18:36.779 --> 00:18:38.979
- I think he's really strong. - He is.

423
00:18:38.979 --> 00:18:40.249
(He's worried about his brother.)

424
00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:41.249
I'm proud of him.

425
00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:43.690
We're nearly there, sir.

426
00:18:43.819 --> 00:18:45.759
- This is crazy. - It's like a survival variety show.

427
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.660
This is like a boot camp training.

428
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.330
It's nature.

429
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.430
(Everyone becomes quiet.)

430
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.670
Anyhow,

431
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.170
is it okay that you can't leave tomorrow?

432
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.309
(We can't...)

433
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:05.080
(leave tomorrow?)

434
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.080
(They're deep in the woods of Hongcheon, Gangwon Province.)

435
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.219
- We can't leave? - You can't leave in this weather.

436
00:19:10.219 --> 00:19:12.819
(Will they actually be stranded?)

437
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.150
(This is a real problem.)

438
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.219
- Really? - Yes.

439
00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:18.259
My goodness.

440
00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:20.029
We are stranded.

441
00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:21.590
We are stranded.

442
00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:23.900
(The paths...)

443
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.999
(are disappearing.)

444
00:19:26.969 --> 00:19:28.700
It's tiring, isn't it?

445
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.870
(Everyone is getting tired.)

446
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:31.900
My goodness.

447
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.239
It must be there.

448
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.640
- Right. We are here. - We are here.

449
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.880
(The light is shining dimly.)

450
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880
We are here.

451
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.749
I never knew I'd be so happy to see the house.

452
00:19:41.749 --> 00:19:44.249
- I know. - It's like an oasis in a desert.

453
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:45.420
- Right? - Yes.

454
00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:47.719
Nobody usually visits the house,

455
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:49.989
but you are cherishing it and loving it.

456
00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:52.360
It looks so beautiful.

457
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.390
Does it? My gosh.

458
00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:55.459
(We're nearly there. Let's cheer up.)

459
00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.229
(They managed to walk through the snow thrown by Elsa.)

460
00:19:58.229 --> 00:19:59.430
This is really great.

461
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.670
It's in the middle of the mountain.

462
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.940
Well done, everyone.

463
00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:05.239
- Well done. - Good job.

464
00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:06.269
Good job, everyone.

465
00:20:07.309 --> 00:20:08.309
(After the boot camp, they finally arrived here.)

466
00:20:08.309 --> 00:20:09.370
Thank you.

467
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.309
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

468
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.209
This is a nice house.

469
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.850
(The master used to stay here whenever he came to Hongcheon.)

470
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.850
This is how precious home is.

471
00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:18.979
It's so warm and nice.

472
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.850
It's very warm there.

473
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:22.890
(After experiencing the wildness of the nature,)

474
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:23.890
Warm your body.

475
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.519
(they realize the preciousness of a home.)

476
00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:26.890
It's so warm and nice.

477
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.759
(He feels sleepy.)

478
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.370
Should I turn the stove on?

479
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.400
Do you use that stove inside?

480
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.309
(Afraid that his guests will get cold, he lights the stove.)

481
00:20:40.309 --> 00:20:41.309
I will fix everything.

482
00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:44.809
- It will be amazing. - It's...

483
00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:47.209
This place is amazing. What's this room for?

484
00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:51.180
(What are all these?)

485
00:20:51.749 --> 00:20:53.090
All the liquors in the world are here.

486
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:55.350
(This is the alcohol room of Zhang Fei's house.)

487
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.190
This is the secret storage.

488
00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.160
(He's got wild ginseng, cultivated ginseng,)

489
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.590
(wild deodeok, Japanese apricot, garlic, cynanchum, lacquer tree,)

490
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.330
(balloon flower root, magnolia berry, wasp liquor, and many more.)

491
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.299
What is this? This is the wasp one. No way.

492
00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:14.110
- Is it wasp liquor? - Look at this.

493
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.009
- What is it? - Wasp liquor.

494
00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:17.340
- Are there wasps inside? - Yes.

495
00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:19.610
- Are they real wasps? - People do this.

496
00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:22.049
(How can you drink this?)

497
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.519
- Isn't that wild ginseng? - This is wild ginseng.

498
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.289
- Wild ginseng. - There's a flower too.

499
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.950
- This is the real wild ginseng. - Right.

500
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.059
Wouldn't you be in big trouble if you drop that?

501
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.289
- He will be in big trouble. - The wild ginseng is huge.

502
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:34.959
Wouldn't you be in big trouble if you drop that?

503
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.360
The wild ginseng is huge.

504
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.299
(No, that's mine.)

505
00:21:39.969 --> 00:21:41.130
I will explain to you.

506
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.330
(It means they should put them down.)

507
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.499
- What's this? - This is deodeok.

508
00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:46.039
- This is... - Is that deodeok?

509
00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:47.840
It's wild deodeok. I picked it 13 years ago.

510
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.039
(They are wild deodeok 13 to 20 years old.)

511
00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:50.180
- Deodeok, you mean? - Yes.

512
00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:51.739
This is about 20 years old.

513
00:21:53.009 --> 00:21:57.779
(He brags about his liquors.)

514
00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:01.989
(All the precious liquors are in here.)

515
00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:03.160
(They become reverent.)

516
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.160
(I feel proud of myself.)

517
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.519
If you were to sell...

518
00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:08.090
any of these, which one would be...

519
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.630
the most expensive?

520
00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:11.799
I wouldn't sell it.

521
00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:15.370
- Would you feel too sad? - I'd feel sad about the lost years.

522
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.870
This is a magical room.

523
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.610
For those who love drinking, this is paradise.

524
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:22.880
Now,

525
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.910
(They are stranded, but it's a paradise.)

526
00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:26.309
you can drink this tonight. It's homemade raspberry wine.

527
00:22:26.309 --> 00:22:27.350
(He gives them the liquor he likes to warm their bodies.)

528
00:22:27.809 --> 00:22:30.219
- It's a little thick. - Thank you.

529
00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:31.650
He brought one out because...

530
00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:33.219
he felt guilty about talking too long in there.

531
00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:34.890
(Muttering to his friend...)

532
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.019
(is his way of saying thank you to him.)

533
00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:37.390
It's really delicious.

534
00:22:37.519 --> 00:22:38.759
- Okay. - Thank you.

535
00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:39.789
- Thank you. - Bye.

536
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.459
Thank you.

537
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.630
Bye. I will see you tomorrow.

538
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.799
- Bye. - Bye.

539
00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:45.799
(Zhang Fei heads to the next door before it gets too late.)

540
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.529
(The snow falls heavier.)

541
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.170
(And they are marooned in the house.)

542
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.509
(They are left alone with the master.)

543
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.910
(There is only one thing...)

544
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.319
(they can do.)

545
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.620
You must be thirsty from walking long.

546
00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.289
You should have some drinks.

547
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.719
Sure.

548
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.590
(It's the moment they've been waiting for.)

549
00:23:15.729 --> 00:23:19.670
(It will be a romantic drinking party with the master.)

550
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.239
Someone fix some food. Is there any food in here?

551
00:23:23.499 --> 00:23:25.539
- I will go check it. - Go check it.

552
00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:27.140
(Is there anything in the kitchen?)

553
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.150
(He finds food like magic.)

554
00:23:34.249 --> 00:23:37.180
(They are extra-large chickens.)

555
00:23:38.519 --> 00:23:40.489
(These are...)

556
00:23:40.489 --> 00:23:41.519
What is it?

557
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:45.390
(the chicken that were cooking in front of Liu Bei's.)

558
00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:48.529
(Liu Bei prepared a perfect meal for them.)

559
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.900
(It's my gift. Enjoy it.)

560
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.430
I will put it back in the soup.

561
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.069
I will boil it in the soup for a while.

562
00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:01.940
(It takes up the whole pot.)

563
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.380
- This chicken is huge. - It's amazing.

564
00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:09.620
This is unbelievable.

565
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.090
The chicken is boiling.

566
00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:14.289
- Is it boiling? - It is.

567
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.350
That's done then.

568
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.390
Use two tongs...

569
00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:18.620
and move it here.

570
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.930
Okay.

571
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.860
- It's really heavy. - It's very heavy.

572
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.299
(Seung Gi plays in the Moving Baeksuk Event.)

573
00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:24.330
(He struggles.)

574
00:24:25.459 --> 00:24:27.029
Support the bottom.

575
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:28.529
That's it.

576
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:29.900
This is...

577
00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:32.569
- Don't drop it from top. - I know.

578
00:24:32.569 --> 00:24:33.809
(They fought the bitter cold and made it this far.)

579
00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:35.069
- Come on. - I got it.

580
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.880
(He's desperate to win this game.)

581
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.249
(It's his 3rd try.)

582
00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:43.150
- You're nearly there. - Come on.

583
00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:44.950
Come on.

584
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.979
(Even if we face a limit and a crisis,)

585
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.819
(if we hold out until the end with perseverance and strong will,)

586
00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:54.890
(we will win baeksuk.)

587
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.259
Come on. That's it.

588
00:24:57.259 --> 00:24:58.759
(Seung Gi wins the gold medal.)

589
00:24:58.759 --> 00:25:00.430
- That's it. - Should I serve it as it is?

590
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.140
(Sang Yoon is watching TV with the master.)

591

(Should I talk to him?)

593
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.519
(The only place their eyes can be is on the TV.)

594
00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:26.759
(The show he's enjoying is...)

595
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.630
(a nature documentary.)

596
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.630
(Laughing)

597
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.799
(Should I laugh?)

598
00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:35.799
I watch...

599
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.039

(I should drink with him.)

603
00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:49.110
Let's drink. Good job.

604
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.019
(They are as awkward as a father-in-law and a son-in-law.)

605
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.920
In the old days, when we didn't have food, we just ate salt.

606
00:25:57.819 --> 00:25:59.660
(Feeling awkward, he copies the master.)

607
00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:03.999
(It's salt.)

608
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.529
(They become so quiet that salt starts forming in their mouths.)

(Seung Gi brings out the huge chicken.)

610

I brought food.

611
00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:14.069
(They drink with Master Bool Am.)

612
00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:15.269
You heated the chickens.

613
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:16.940
Yes. I heated it.

614
00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:19.809
Let's eat now. This is enough, isn't it?

615
00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:23.219
This is amazing. It looks so good.

616
00:26:23.219 --> 00:26:24.979
Where did you find the kimchi?

617
00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:27.350
It was in the fridge.

618
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.350
(It's an amazing combination of kimchi and baeksuk.)

619
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.059
Master, according to the time table...

620
00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:32.989
you wrote for us,

621
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:36.630
there was time for a heart exercise. What is that?

622
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.299
(What is this exercise he does before sleep?)

623
00:26:40.769 --> 00:26:43.569
- It's drinking time. - I see.

624
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.469
It helps your blood circulation.

625
00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:48.709
It makes your heart beat faster.

626
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:50.239
I love that time.

627
00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:53.549
That's the heart exercise.

628
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.049
(I love the heart exercise.)

629

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.950
- Well done, everyone. - Well done.

631
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.420
Cheers.

632
00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:04.319
It looks like it would be really good for you.

633
00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:06.120
It's very sweet.

634
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.630
Have some meat, sir.

635
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:09.600
Let's eat.

636
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.200
This chicken is delicious.

637
00:27:13.769 --> 00:27:16.539
(This chicken is lovely.)

638
00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:18.840
(It was a tiring day,)

639
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.009
(and they recharge their energy with baeksuk.)

640
00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:24.009
- This is delicious. - This is really delicious.

641
00:27:25.539 --> 00:27:27.150
Don't we look like his grandsons?

642
00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.049
It's like we've come to visit our grandfather.

643
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.479
(He's happy to see his grandsons eating well.)

644
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.690
(One of them eats more than the others.)

645
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:35.690
I am happy.

646
00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:38.860
(It's the youngest one, Seong Jae.)

647
00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.029
(His appetite explodes,)

648
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:43.900
(and he enjoys his time with baeksuk.)

649
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.630
We are eating so well today.

650
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.130
(Baeksuk is meant to be drank.)

651
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.130
We were starved.

652
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.969
(He's happy watching them.)

653
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:55.140
How do you feel when you drink?

654
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.910
Even now, I don't know how I feel after I drink.

655
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.279
(Why do we drink alcohol?)

656
00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:04.249
You've been drinking since you were young,

657
00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:06.219
- but you still don't know. - I still don't know the answer.

658
00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:09.289
Honestly, I have never...

659
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.420
seriously thought about...

660
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.789
why I drink.

661
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.029
I usually drink because my colleagues invite me to parties.

662
00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:23.969
Or I drink with my friends. I see them almost every day.

663
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.410
We drink because we have nothing better to do.

664
00:28:27.469 --> 00:28:28.469
That's the answer.

665
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.140
At first,

666
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.709
(Why does Se Hyeong drink?)

667
00:28:33.709 --> 00:28:37.420
I used to think it's an adult version of playing.

668
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.590
But one of the rules I gave to myself is...

669
00:28:40.049 --> 00:28:41.819
that I don't drink when I am not in a good mood.

670
00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:44.759
I drink only when I feel good.

671
00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:46.330
- That's very wise. - Yes.

672
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:51.299
Now I remember why I used to drink.

673
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.769
I'm sure you don't know about "Chief Inspector".

674
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.739
I know. I've never seen it, but I know what it is.

675
00:28:57.739 --> 00:28:59.039
Most of the episodes...

676
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.009
had a heartrending story.

677
00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:05.739
It was about people who commit crimes to survive the tough times.

678
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.049
It was very sad.

679
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:10.950
I strongly sympathized with the characters and felt sad.

680
00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:13.650
I felt upset.

681
00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:17.319
After acting in the drama which portrayed stories about...

682
00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:20.390
sorrows and joys of life,

683
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:22.289
I often found my heart...

684
00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:26.400
burning inside when I went home.

685
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.569
(He was often upset even after he got home from the shoot.)

686
00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:32.539
My heart was burning.

687
00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:35.769
And water wasn't going to put out the fire.

688
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.110
Only alcohol could do it.

689
00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:40.880
I would run into a pub.

690
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.779
I would get whatever drink I could. Makgeolli, beer, or soju.

691
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.350
After gulping it down,

692
00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:49.920
I felt like the fire was put out.

693
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.860
It felt like pouring water onto burning charcoals.

694
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.729
So alcohol was what I used to put out fire in my heart.

695
00:29:59.729 --> 00:30:03.870
(It put out the fire in his heart.)

696
00:30:05.499 --> 00:30:07.110
I thought of this while you were talking.

697
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.880
We usually just drink for fun,

698
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.180
so we play a lot of drinking games.

699
00:30:12.309 --> 00:30:13.950
- Games? - Yes. Drinking games.

700
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.180
Right.

701
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.380
Play a game then. I will watch you.

702
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.380
There's this thing we do.

703
00:30:18.479 --> 00:30:20.890
Master, you are going to drink it bottoms-up, right?

704
00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:23.259
You can't drink it half-way.

705
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.360
(Seong Jae's cute action...)

706
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.130
(starts the game time.)

707
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.130
Try it.

708
00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:31.830
We will show you something fun. Let's play Hunminjeongeum.

709
00:30:32.229 --> 00:30:35.069
(Hunminjeongeum?)

710
00:30:35.769 --> 00:30:37.499
- That's a good one. - Hunminjeongeum.

711
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.539
- This is a good one. - I think he will be good at this.

712
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.140
There's a game called Hunminjeongeum.

713
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:44.640
One person will give only the initials of a word.

714
00:30:45.479 --> 00:30:47.249
For example, I will say, "K and d."

715
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.380
The initials are k and d.

716
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.319
- Dress shoes. - Conch.

717
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.819
When you think of a word, you can grab my thumb.

718
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.390
- Let's try it. - Let's try it.

719
00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:00.930
I will teach you the move too. Just lightly flap your arms.

720
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:01.930
(Like this?)

721
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.259
(He shrugs his shoulders.)

722
00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:06.029
(He tries to learn the youth's lifestyle...)

723
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:07.469
(by flapping his arms.)

724
00:31:07.469 --> 00:31:09.940
(He's cute.)

725
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.299
(His flapping is still clumsy.)

726
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.269
- Let's practice it again. - Okay.

727
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:15.539
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - Hunminjeongeum, Hunminjeongeum

728
00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:16.779
Wait, sir.

729
00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:22.150
(What is he going to say this time?)

730
00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:26.180
Wait, sir. You can't just flap your arms.

731
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:29.190
If you don't sing the song, you lose.

732
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:30.219
Everyone has to sing.

733
00:31:30.219 --> 00:31:31.259
(It's hard.)

734
00:31:31.259 --> 00:31:32.459
I will give the initials.

735
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:35.890
- Hunminjeongeum, Hunminjeongeum - Hunminjeongeum, Hunminjeongeum

736
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.830
(We can hear the master's low voice.)

737
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.729
(He flaps his arms.)

738
00:31:40.569 --> 00:31:46.100
- Hun, min, jeong, eum - Hun, min, jeong, eum

739
00:31:46.239 --> 00:31:47.509
- Hunminjeongeum - Hunminjeongeum

740
00:31:48.809 --> 00:31:49.840
S and p.

741
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.440
- Bubble. - Sandpaper.

742
00:31:53.309 --> 00:31:56.049
S and p.

743
00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.989
(Who is going to lose?)

744
00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:03.019
Chopin.

745
00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:05.120
(Chopin)

746
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.330
- Okay. - Right, there's Chopin.

747
00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:10.360
- This is how it goes. - This is how it goes.

748
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.959
- This is how it goes. - "S and p" was difficult.

749
00:32:11.959 --> 00:32:13.969
- I made it difficult. - It was.

750
00:32:14.069 --> 00:32:15.330
You have to remain calm, don't you?

751
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.600
Here. Hold a chopstick.

752
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.999
(What's this now?)

753
00:32:18.999 --> 00:32:20.709
When a game finishes,

754
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.279
you need to hurry and start the next round.

755
00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:27.209
There is no time to rest There is no time to rest

756
00:32:27.309 --> 00:32:30.450
Until when will you make us wait

757
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:31.819
Hurry up

758
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.890
This is what you do to get the game going.

759
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.350
(There is a lot to learn.)

760
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.090
Let's begin with "There's no time to rest".

761
00:32:38.219 --> 00:32:41.259
1, 2, 3, 4. There's no time to rest

762
00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.200
(There's a snow storm outside,)

763
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.160
(but it's peaceful and heartwarming in the house.)

764
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.430
(There's no time to rest)

765
00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:53.469
(It became a tongue twister with too much learning.)

766
00:32:53.469 --> 00:32:54.569
Until when will you make us wait

767
00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:56.739
(They have long forgotten about the snow storm.)

768
00:32:56.739 --> 00:32:58.140
(Hurry up with the next round.)

769
00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.880
1, 2, 3, 4.

770
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.749
(The main game starts.)

771
00:33:02.249 --> 00:33:07.489
- Hun, min, jeong, eum - Hun, min, jeong, eum

772
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.759
- Hun, min, jeong, eum - N and j.

773
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.819
- Naju. - Okay.

774
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.259
(N and j.)

775
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.029
- It's n and j. - No fun.

776
00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.799
- That's okay too. - N and j.

777
00:33:20.529 --> 00:33:23.170
(N and j.)

778
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.799
- N and j. - It's n and j.

779
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:27.309
N and j.

780
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.410
(He holds the thumb first.)

781
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.440
N and j.

782
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.650
(How will it end?)

783
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.680
Street stall.

784
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.120
(Street stall.)

785
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.120
Right!

786
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.120
(Did you see that?)

787
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.350
(He's good.)

788
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.660
I can't think well after drinking.

789
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.019
- It was tough. - I couldn't think.

790
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.400
- Now you can... - I should go to bed.

791
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.360
You should go to bed first.

792
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.299
(Someone familiar...)

793
00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:57.440
(visits them.)

794
00:33:58.969 --> 00:34:00.969
- Go in. - Did you walk here?

795
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.469
- Is someone here? - Oh, dear.

796
00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:05.840
- It's... - Why didn't you take the drink?

797
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.180
I know. The car couldn't come up.

798
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.749
This is good for arthritis.

799
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.290
- This is better than anything. - Goodness.

800
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.620
(He walked through the snow to give him the drink.)

801
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.660
Have you eaten?

802
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.830
- Right. - He's drinking this right now.

803
00:34:23.899 --> 00:34:25.899
Come here.

804
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.899
I will bring chopsticks.

805
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.799
Have a seat.

806
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.799
Sit next to me.

807
00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:34.939
(Feeling embarrassed, he makes the child sit next to him.)

808
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.980
- To bring me the liquor, - Yes.

809
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.350
(Liu Bei brought him liquor he made,)

810
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.379
he walked up the mountain.

811
00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:46.419
(and he had to walk up the mountain in the snow.)

812
00:34:46.419 --> 00:34:47.419
He walked all the way from there.

813
00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:48.620
(He walked all the way up.)

814
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.890
I shouldn't forget it.

815
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:53.689
I feel so touched.

816
00:34:53.689 --> 00:34:56.299
(He's touched.)

817
00:34:57.529 --> 00:35:01.669
I was so happy drinking with my pupils.

818
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.939
It's an honor for us.

819
00:35:03.939 --> 00:35:06.410
- Thank you. - I will go to bed now.

820
00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:08.370
You should go to bed first.

821
00:35:08.569 --> 00:35:09.710
When you sleep,

822
00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.450
one of us will...

823
00:35:13.649 --> 00:35:15.750
go sleep beside you.

824
00:35:17.319 --> 00:35:20.219
(He didn't know until then.)

825
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.290
(He has to wear matching pajamas with the master,)

826
00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:26.330
(wash his feet,)

827
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:27.930
Let's sing a lullaby to him.

828
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.000
(and sing a lullaby to the master.)

829
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.160
It would be fine as long as it's not me.

830
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.629
(He laughed at the master's future roommate.)

831
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:40.739
You should rest first. We will take care of the rest.

832
00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.140
I wanted you...

833
00:35:43.779 --> 00:35:47.350
to have good night's sleep, so we got you...

834
00:35:47.649 --> 00:35:49.620
- a pair of pajamas. - Did you?

835
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.719
You can just put them on top of your clothes.

836
00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:54.520
This is supposed to make you sleep well.

837
00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:57.020
This is it. You can get changed there.

838
00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.189
It looks like what a clown would wear.

839
00:36:01.989 --> 00:36:05.060
(It seems like he doesn't like it.)

840
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.399
When you actually wear it.

841
00:36:09.399 --> 00:36:10.969
- You'll sleep well. - It's very soft.

842
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.839
It will make you sleep like a baby.

843
00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:14.839
- It's very soft. - Are these pajamas?

844
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.839
- Yes. - Can I take these home?

845
00:36:16.839 --> 00:36:19.080
- Of course you can. - Of course they are yours.

846
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.609
- Well then. - You don't have to return them.

847
00:36:21.609 --> 00:36:22.879
(There's no reason to refuse it.)

848
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.950
I will go to bed now.

849
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.689
- Have a good sleep. - I will join you shortly.

850
00:36:27.689 --> 00:36:29.020
Thank you.

851
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.719
- Have a good night. - Give me that.

852
00:36:31.319 --> 00:36:32.660
- His bag. - His bag.

853
00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.660
No.

854
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.460
(This?)

855
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.500
No.

856
00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:38.399
(He loves Se Hyeong's sense of humor.)

857
00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:41.200
- You're so funny. - That was funny.

858
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.000
- That was funny. - I love how funny you are.

859
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.270
Thank you.

860
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.669
- Good night. - Good night, sir.

861
00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:49.069
I will come outside when I get bored.

862
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:50.180
- Have a good rest. - Okay.

863
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:55.680
I think he's going to get upset when I wash his feet.

864
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.219
Don't you have to sing him a lullaby too?

865
00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.180
It's Se Hyeong's problem.

866
00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.390
I will just do it.

867
00:37:01.989 --> 00:37:02.989
This is funny.

868
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.089
Look at you.

869
00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:07.129
You are so adorable.

870
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.600
(While Se Hyeong is showing off his stunning looks,)

871
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.870
(the master casually puts on the pajamas.)

872
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.939
(With overflowing charisma, he gets ready for bed.)

873
00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:27.049
(He put on the matching pajamas,)

874
00:37:27.049 --> 00:37:30.020
(but he's got other things to get done.)

875
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.890
(He has to wash the master's feet.)

876
00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:35.919
You know how embarrassing that would be, right?

877
00:37:35.919 --> 00:37:38.060
It's embarrassing, but you become very close.

878
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.129
(Why on earth did I do that?)

879
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.759
(It must be so embarrassing.)

880
00:37:49.939 --> 00:37:52.870
(Why did he suggest to wash the master's feet?)

881
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.669
(Laughing)

882
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:00.980
(He sighs.)

883
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.120
(Let's get water first.)

884
00:38:08.549 --> 00:38:11.689
I am so glad that it's not me.

885
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.029
(He checks the temperature of the water.)

886
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.969
It suits him well.

887
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.540
He looks so funny from here.

888
00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:28.040
(Wearing bunny pajamas, he's filling a basin with water.)

889
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.370
It's so funny.

890
00:38:30.009 --> 00:38:31.879
Even his back is funny.

891
00:38:31.939 --> 00:38:34.049
(He looks chubby from the back.)

892
00:38:35.009 --> 00:38:36.520
It's funny because it's not me.

893
00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:40.549
(I am serious right now.)

894
00:38:40.549 --> 00:38:42.520
(I am serious.)

895
00:38:44.919 --> 00:38:47.830
(The 2nd mission is washing the master's feet.)

896
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.230
(They just watch him.)

897
00:38:53.799 --> 00:38:56.299
(It's finally time to wash the master's feet.)

898
00:38:56.299 --> 00:38:59.779
I think he's going to get upset if I wash his feet.

899
00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:07.130
(The 2nd mission is washing the master's feet.)

900
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.530
(They just watch him.)

901
00:39:13.099 --> 00:39:16.199
(It's finally time to wash the master's feet.)

902
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.280
I think he's going to get upset if I wash his feet.

903
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.610
(Oh, no.)

904
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.920
(The master is...)

905
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.420
(sleeping.)

906
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.389
(What do I do?)

907
00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:40.230
(Should I wake him up or should I not?)

908
00:39:41.659 --> 00:39:44.400
(Curious, Seung Gi...)

909
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.070
(sticks his camera inside the room.)

910
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.869
(What do I do?)

911
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.969
(What do you mean? You should wash his feet.)

912
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.340
(He thinks carefully.)

913
00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:06.920
(Will he fail to wash the master's feet?)

914
00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:11.320
(Yes! I have decided.)

915
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.389
I will fix the blanket for you.

916
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.900
(He pretends to fix the blanket.)

917
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.230
I will be sleeping next to you tonight.

918
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.369
- Right. - Right.

919
00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:21.070
I will be sleeping on the floor.

920
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.570
There are beddings for the floor.

921
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.570
- Yes, there are. - There are beddings.

922
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.139
I will fix them.

923
00:40:26.139 --> 00:40:28.940
(The master tries to sleep again.)

924
00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.610
(No.)

925
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.210
(I must tell him now.)

926
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.050
A foot bath would be too much, wouldn't it?

927
00:40:40.719 --> 00:40:44.820
- What are you saying? - Right.

928
00:40:46.659 --> 00:40:49.130
(Se Hyeong is ruined.)

929
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.059
(He retreats for now.)

930
00:40:52.059 --> 00:40:54.400
You should sleep. I will sleep on the floor.

931
00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:57.369
These pajamas are so warm.

932
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.380
- I will turn off the light. - Okay.

933
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.510
Thanks to the pajamas,

934
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.219
- It's nice and soft, isn't it? - I am going to sleep well.

935
00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:12.150
To make you sleep even better,

936
00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:14.519
I will sing you a lullaby.

937
00:41:14.519 --> 00:41:16.690
Stop talking nonsense.

938
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:17.690
(Se Hyeong is surprised.)

939
00:41:18.389 --> 00:41:20.090
(They try not to laugh.)

940
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:23.500
- Please listen for just a minute. - I really hate that.

941
00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.699
Let's just talk about the old days.

942
00:41:27.699 --> 00:41:29.769
(Will he fail to sing the lullaby too?)

943
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:33.469
- I practiced. Can I show you? - Don't do it.

944
00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:36.579
(But I have to do it.)

945
00:41:36.579 --> 00:41:38.139
I am not a baby.

946
00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:39.150
That's not it.

947
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.679
I don't need to be adored.

948
00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:45.690
Every day with you

949
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.489
Every day with you

950
00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.889
(He's singing.)

951
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.659
(Every day with you)

952
00:41:58.659 --> 00:42:03.769
(I enjoy the morning sun)

953
00:42:03.769 --> 00:42:08.239
- Enjoy what? - Every day

954
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.309
- It's that song. - I want to wake up with you

955
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.380
(Today, I wanted to...)

956
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.289
(spend time to talk to you.)

957
00:42:25.789 --> 00:42:30.329
(I wanted to keep all your love to myself.)

958
00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:34.929
(I tried and tried,)

959
00:42:34.929 --> 00:42:38.670
(but why won't you love me back?)

960
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:48.110
(Can you hear my serenade for you?)

961
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.980
(He's serious, isn't he?)

962
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:58.059
(I want to share it with you)

963
00:42:58.059 --> 00:42:59.130
(Ah)

964
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.659
(Ah)

965
00:43:04.059 --> 00:43:06.530
(He's going to summon a ghost.)

966
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.309
Every day with Bul Am

967
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:20.780
(Every day with Bul Am)

968
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:21.780
(He laughs.)

969
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.949
I'm awake now.

970
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.150
He said, "every day with Bul Am".

971
00:43:31.059 --> 00:43:32.460
I can't sleep now.

972
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.159
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

973
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.929
Did you used to sing a lullaby to your children?

974
00:43:38.599 --> 00:43:41.099
I did, when they were babies.

975
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.369
I used to sing this...

976
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.840
to my daughter.

977
00:43:46.769 --> 00:43:49.880
(Will he sing it to Se Hyeong?)

978
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.079
(It's seems that Se Hyeong impressed him.)

979
00:43:56.349 --> 00:44:01.489
(Good night my darling)

980
00:44:01.489 --> 00:44:02.889
Sleep well

981
00:44:02.889 --> 00:44:06.360
(The master sings for Se Hyeong,)

982
00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:12.530
(who wants to be the master's darling.)

983
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.170
Have a sweet dream

984
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.010
I will wash your feet when you wake up tomorrow.

985
00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:20.909
Don't do it.

986
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.940
(He's very determined.)

987
00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.420
- Open the door... - Okay.

988
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.119
and tell them I said they should sleep.

989
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.920
Tell them to stop making the rustling sound.

990
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.489
They should stop making the rustling sound?

991
00:44:37.019 --> 00:44:38.019
Yes.

992
00:44:38.489 --> 00:44:41.260
(He takes all the master's love to himself...)

993
00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:45.869
(and walks out of the room arrogantly.)

994
00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.099
(And he delivers the master's message.)

995
00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:52.269
The master says you should stop making the rustling sound.

996
00:44:52.269 --> 00:44:54.610
(Stop making the rustling sound.)

997
00:44:56.179 --> 00:44:59.949
Every day with Bul Am

998
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.050
It won't stop snowing. It's snowing even heavier.

999
00:45:07.949 --> 00:45:09.389
It's snowing heavier than before.

1000
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.760
It's going to snow all night.

1001
00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.460
- My goodness. - What if we get isolated here?

1002
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:16.559
It's a serious situation.

1003
00:45:16.659 --> 00:45:18.130
Isn't this considered heavy snow?

1004
00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:19.869
- It's... - Seriously,

1005
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:21.829
this is not joke.

1006
00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:23.940
How can it snow so much?

1007
00:45:25.039 --> 00:45:27.409
All I can see is buildings and the ground.

1008
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.710
What if we get stranded here?

1009
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.940
(What if we can't get out?)

1010
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.349
Even the road is completely gone. It was right there.

1011
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:35.820
(They can't even see the road.)

1012
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.349
I think the snow has piled up to our knees.

1013
00:45:38.579 --> 00:45:39.989
We're in big trouble.

1014
00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:44.719
- But I must say, it's so pretty. - It is.

1015
00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:49.059
(They've forgotten their worries.)

1016
00:45:49.059 --> 00:45:51.829
We'll be able to go all the way down in a sled, don't you think?

1017
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:53.429
I feel like Elsa will jump out at us.

1018
00:45:53.429 --> 00:45:54.699
(Snow makes them feel like children.)

1019
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
It looks so nice over here too.

1020
00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:58.940
Isn't it so pretty?

1021
00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:01.409
Shall we have some tea?

1022
00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.039
Yes, that would be great.

1023
00:46:03.039 --> 00:46:04.840
- Let's reflect on our day. - Sounds good.

1024
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.150
(They'll have a cup of tea while enjoying this romantic scenery.)

1025
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.519
In some foreign movies,

1026
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.519
you see people traveling to places like this.

1027
00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:14.119
- A mountain cabin... - Yes, totally.

1028
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.019
- in a snowy place like this. - That's right.

1029
00:46:16.019 --> 00:46:17.019
But we...

1030
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.130
just ended up here.

1031
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.730
(We could come here thanks to the master.)

1032
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.929
(Now that they have some time to relax,)

1033
00:46:25.929 --> 00:46:29.199
(they can finally reflect on everything that happened today.)

1034
00:46:29.469 --> 00:46:32.809
(Things they would've never learned if they hadn't met the master)

1035
00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:36.679
(Trees get very lonely.)

1036
00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:41.679
(But in order to reach high in the sky,)

1037
00:46:41.679 --> 00:46:44.380
(they endure the loneliness and stay focused.)

1038
00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:46.989
Shall I call it romance?

1039
00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:50.519
(The sense of romance they would've never felt if they hadn't met him)

1040
00:46:50.519 --> 00:46:54.190
(And the people they would've never met if it weren't for him)

1041
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:57.559
I must say, when the three of them...

1042
00:46:58.199 --> 00:46:59.369
were walking in...

1043
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.469
I still can't forget the looks on their faces...

1044
00:47:03.469 --> 00:47:04.699
the moment they saw the master.

1045
00:47:07.239 --> 00:47:08.809
- Right here... - Their eyes welled up with tears.

1046
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:10.210
Yes, I know. I saw it too.

1047
00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.110
They must've missed him a lot.

1048
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.510
As soon as they saw him,

1049
00:47:13.949 --> 00:47:15.550
they were choked with emotion.

1050
00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:17.820
Even though they were physically far away from him,

1051
00:47:18.449 --> 00:47:20.420
- they must've always... - Gosh, that's sad.

1052
00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:23.820
He must've always been on their mind...

1053
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:24.960
because they missed him.

1054
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.329
"Is everything going well for him? Would he be doing well?"

1055
00:47:28.289 --> 00:47:30.300
What should we do to make friends like them?

1056
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:36.539
Gosh, in life...

1057
00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:38.969
(It makes me reflect on my life.)

1058
00:47:38.969 --> 00:47:40.840
How many friends like them do I have?

1059
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.280
(How many friends like them are in my life?)

1060
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.309
That's what it made me think.

1061
00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:54.289
(A friend that never changes)

1062
00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:00.489
(A friend whom you always miss)

1063
00:48:00.489 --> 00:48:01.530
You look the same.

1064
00:48:03.099 --> 00:48:08.030
(Time always flows at the same rate for such friends.)

1065
00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.800
It's not like time doesn't flow for some people.

1066
00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:13.739
Time only stops when you die.

1067
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.349
- He's so happy to see them. - I know, right?

1068
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:21.210
(They even withstand the weight of time together.)

1069
00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:22.679
- His eyes are welled up with tears. - Yes.

1070
00:48:22.679 --> 00:48:24.880
(They even withstand the weight of time together.)

1071
00:48:28.389 --> 00:48:31.260
What would it be? What creates such friendship?

1072
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.530
(Could we become like them too?)

1073
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.230
- Loyalty. - Right, loyalty toward each other.

1074
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:38.130
(Their loyalty enabled them to maintain such friendship.)

1075
00:48:41.369 --> 00:48:43.940
Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took an oath under a peach tree...

1076
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.239
- while sharing a glass of drink. - That's right.

1077
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.510
How about we do the same thing on the field of snow?

1078
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.679
(On the field of snow?)

1079
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.150
You're saying we'll...

1080
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.219
- take an oath in the snow, right? - Yes, exactly.

1081
00:49:00.219 --> 00:49:02.360
We'll take an oath and become sworn brothers in the snow.

1082
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.329
We can share a handful of snow instead of a glass of drink.

1083
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:07.730
What?

1084
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.230
(We'll eat snow?)

1085
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:10.230
It'll be so cool.

1086
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.159
My face still feels a bit numb.

1087
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.340
Sure, let's do it.

1088
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.440
(It can't affect our friendship.)

1089
00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.510
All right. Let's head out, then.

1090
00:49:21.239 --> 00:49:23.210
(The Oath on the Snowfield)

1091
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.039
My, there's so much snow. This is crazy.

1092
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:27.750
(In 2018,)

1093
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.980
(on a winter night with snowflakes falling like peach blossom petals,)

1094
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:32.889
(these four guys take an oath...)

1095
00:49:32.889 --> 00:49:35.420
(and become sworn brothers...)

1096
00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:39.360
(on a snowy hill in Hongcheon, Gangwon Province.)

1097
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:40.690
The Oath on the Snowfield.

1098
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.199
(Seung Gi is overly eager.)

1099
00:49:43.059 --> 00:49:44.099
The Oath on the Snowfield...

1100
00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:45.329
(The sentimental guy, Seong Jae)

1101
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.269
(The chipper guy, Se Hyeong)

1102
00:49:49.239 --> 00:49:50.769
(The root, Sang Yun)

1103
00:49:50.769 --> 00:49:52.409
Even if we don't see each other for 25 years,

1104
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.340
our friendship won't change.

1105
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.469
(We'll remember each other.)

1106
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:57.510
The Oath on the Snowfield.

1107
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:59.710
(What does loyalty mean to you?)

1108
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:01.780
When Seong Jae comes to see me,

1109
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.449
I'll treat him the way I do now even if he's no longer a member of BTOB.

1110
00:50:07.219 --> 00:50:09.360
Have you been good to me because I'm a member of BTOB?

1111
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.590
Of course not. That's not why I've been good to you.

1112
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:13.889
I won't care about any of the superficial stuff.

1113
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.800
If Seong Jae comes to see me, I'll gladly...

1114
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.429
invite him over to my place for a meal.

1115
00:50:19.429 --> 00:50:20.429
(He's always welcome at Seung Gi's place.)

1116
00:50:20.429 --> 00:50:21.800
And we'll have drinks together.

1117
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.539
We met like this and have become friends, you know.

1118
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.210
(That sounds pretty good.)

1119
00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.309
For me... Let's say something bad happens...

1120
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:31.039
to you guys when we're older.

1121
00:50:32.039 --> 00:50:34.150
If you guys come to me for help,

1122
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.380
the three of you...

1123
00:50:35.679 --> 00:50:37.820
Well, nothing bad should happen, of course.

1124
00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.150
But I don't think I'll give you guys money.

1125
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:46.530
Instead, I'll probably give you a job so that you can earn a living.

1126
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:48.530
- A job? - For example...

1127
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:49.630
You know.

1128
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.800
For example, I can give you a store manager position.

1129
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.699
That way, you'll be able to earn money yourself.

1130
00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:57.840
(Is that so?)

1131
00:50:58.909 --> 00:51:02.070
If we meet again when our hair is all white...

1132
00:51:02.679 --> 00:51:04.039
If we meet again when we're that old,

1133
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:08.010
I'll let you guys live with me at my place...

1134
00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.349
until we feel that we've spent enough time with each other...

1135
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.489
and want to go back to our day-to-day lives.

1136
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.489
- Seriously? - Yes.

1137
00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.760
- We'll eat together too. - Even if you live with your family?

1138
00:51:15.889 --> 00:51:18.260
Of course. We'll eat together, and we'll have drinks at night too.

1139
00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:20.159
We can also go to the sauna together.

1140
00:51:20.389 --> 00:51:22.090
That's the coolest answer so far. I'll do the same.

1141
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:25.900
I'll...

1142
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.329
(How will the youngest one, Seong Jae, express his loyalty?)

1143
00:51:28.329 --> 00:51:31.070
When I meet you guys again 25 years later,

1144
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.909
I'll shed tears for you.

1145
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:38.239
No matter what the meaning may be.

1146
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.880
You all saw the look on Master Zhang Fei's face earlier.

1147
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.150
(Like our masters)

1148
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:44.150
With those loving eyes.

1149
00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.090
I'll look like I still miss you guys even when I'm looking at you.

1150
00:51:50.889 --> 00:51:53.989
(This oath started out as a joke,)

1151
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:57.159
(but what the youngest member said...)

1152
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.070
(made them all serious about it.)

1153
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.329
- Then shall we take an oath now? - Yes, we should.

1154
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.139
- Grab a handful of snow. - A handful of snow.

1155
00:52:03.199 --> 00:52:06.369
We should show how sincere we are through the amount of snow.

1156
00:52:06.639 --> 00:52:09.010
Just enough to show how determined we are about this pledge.

1157
00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.039
- Okay. - This snow proves our friendship...

1158
00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:12.880
- as well as our pledge. - Okay, got it.

1159
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880
- All right? - Okay.

1160
00:52:13.909 --> 00:52:14.949
All right. Let's get some snow.

1161
00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:16.949
- Let's go. - Okay.

1162
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:21.219
(A white snowfield no one has stepped on)

1163
00:52:21.219 --> 00:52:23.019
Gosh, what is this? It's this deep?

1164
00:52:23.019 --> 00:52:25.360
(In order to take an oath,)

1165
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:28.190
(they plunge into the snow.)

1166
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.429
- Gosh, there's so much snow. - It's really deep.

1167
00:52:31.429 --> 00:52:32.429
(Even if a rough road lies ahead...)

1168
00:52:32.429 --> 00:52:34.170
Gosh, what is this? It's this deep?

1169
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.170
(We'll overcome it together.)

1170
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:37.099
- I've never been in snow like this. - Me neither.

1171
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.710
- I've never seen this much snow. - Seriously.

1172
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.840
- This feels nice though. - Yes, it's not bad.

1173
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.179
- Let's do it, guys. - Okay.

1174
00:52:44.179 --> 00:52:45.280
Grab a handful of snow.

1175
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.750
(The Oath on the Snowfield)

1176
00:52:48.949 --> 00:52:51.380
(This snow is a token of our friendship...)

1177
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.019
(as well as our pledge.)

1178
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.820
(Our friendship is very precious.)

1179
00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.690
(Pressing)

1180
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:05.329
All the Butlers' Oath in the Snowfield.

1181
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:06.329
(Everyone has scooped up snow.)

1182
00:53:06.469 --> 00:53:07.800
- Let our friendship last forever. - What?

1183
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.199
(Am I the only one who's sincere?)

1184
00:53:09.969 --> 00:53:11.469
(Only Sang Yun has a huge ball of snow.)

1185
00:53:11.469 --> 00:53:12.710
What's going on?

1186
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.610
(Sorry, Sang Yun.)

1187
00:53:15.409 --> 00:53:16.739
(They fooled me once again.)

1188
00:53:17.579 --> 00:53:19.809
Let's toast as we're shouting "All the Butlers" together.

1189
00:53:20.179 --> 00:53:21.780
Then we'll eat the snow. Okay, let's do this.

1190
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.780
(Now, they're sincere.)

1191
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.150
All the Butlers' Oath in the Snowfield.

1192
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:25.250
- All the Butlers! - All the Butlers!

1193
00:53:26.619 --> 00:53:27.820
- All the Butlers! - All the Butlers!

1194
01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.279
All the Butlers' Oath in the Snowfield.

1195
01:01:29.279 --> 01:01:30.279
(Everyone has scooped up snow.)

1196
01:01:30.419 --> 01:01:31.750
- Let our friendship last forever. - What?

1197
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.149
(Am I the only one who's sincere?)

1198
01:01:33.919 --> 01:01:35.419
(Only Sang Yun has a huge ball of snow.)

1199
01:01:35.419 --> 01:01:36.660
What's going on?

1200
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.560
(Sorry, Sang Yun.)

1201
01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:40.689
(They fooled me once again.)

1202
01:01:41.529 --> 01:01:43.759
Let's toast as we're shouting "All the Butlers" together.

1203
01:01:44.129 --> 01:01:45.730
Then we'll eat the snow. Okay, let's do this.

1204
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:46.730
(Now, they're sincere.)

1205
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.100
All the Butlers' Oath in the Snowfield.

1206
01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.200
- All the Butlers! - All the Butlers!

1207
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:51.770
- All the Butlers! - All the Butlers!

1210
01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.259
(What we ate isn't just a handful of snow.)

1211
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.500
(It'll become our blood and flesh,)

1212
01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:25.540
(and it'll enable us to stay connected eternally.)

1213
01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.710
What is this taste?

1214
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.710
(But it tastes a little funky.)

1215
01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.580
(Why does it taste like this?)

1216
01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.080
Gosh, this is...

1217
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.350
(Did I eat too much?)

1218
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:38.980
I think I ate too much.

1219
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.250
I know what we're tasting.

1220
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:46.330
Well, you know. It must be fine dust.

1221
01:02:47.489 --> 01:02:49.600
It does taste a little bit like that.

1222
01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.960
But this is...

1223
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:52.359
Hey.

1224
01:02:52.359 --> 01:02:53.799
(This taste is really...)

1225
01:02:53.799 --> 01:02:54.899
It tastes so weird.

1226
01:02:54.899 --> 01:02:56.500
(The snow tastes so weird.)

1227
01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:00.969
(Sang Yun is analyzing it, thinking that it definitely tastes familiar.)

1228
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.140
- I'm serious. - It tastes a little bit like sand.

1229
01:03:04.509 --> 01:03:05.540
I can taste fine dust.

1230
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:06.549
(They took the oath anyway.)

1231
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:07.580
Let's go in, guys.

1232
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.680
I'm so cold. Snow even got in my socks.

1233
01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:18.020
But it's actually very delicious.

1234
01:03:18.859 --> 01:03:20.589
I ate too much,

1235
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.290
but it really tastes like cotton candy. Also...

1236
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.770
You know the type of crushed ice dessert that's popular now, right?

1237
01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:27.799
It actually tastes like that.

1238
01:03:29.669 --> 01:03:30.739
What is this taste?

1239
01:03:30.739 --> 01:03:31.739
(He tries another mouthful.)

1240
01:03:31.739 --> 01:03:32.770
Are you eating more snow?

1241
01:03:35.509 --> 01:03:37.680
- I think he'll keep eating it. - He said it's like crushed ice.

1242
01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:38.779
I'm serious.

1243
01:03:38.939 --> 01:03:40.180
Do we have strawberry jam?

1244
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:44.180
It'll be pretty tasty with things like strawberry jam or syrup.

1245
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.719
(We hope you reminisce today together 25 years later.)

1246
01:03:46.719 --> 01:03:49.089
- Never forget about our oath. - Okay.

1247
01:03:49.149 --> 01:03:50.259
- Of course. - All right.

1248
01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.500
(With firm determination,)

1249
01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:00.200
(Se Hyeong gets ready to sleep beside the master.)

1250
01:04:03.169 --> 01:04:06.839
(Could it be because of the oath?)

1251
01:04:08.969 --> 01:04:11.939
(Even though not all of them are sleeping side by side,)

1252
01:04:11.939 --> 01:04:15.480
(they fell asleep in the exact same posture.)

1253
01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:21.419
(Maybe they're having the same dream.)

1254
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.230
(Every day, we want to enjoy...)

1255
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:29.859
(the morning sunshine with Bool Am.)

1256
01:04:31.759 --> 01:04:33.600
(Every day,)

(1 morning in Hongcheon at 5:50am)

1259

Let's do it together.

1260
01:04:42.339 --> 01:04:45.379
(These two guys are already up.)

1261
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:49.680
You have to fold it the same way. That's it.

1262
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.620
(Since they've sung lullabies to each other,)

1263
01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.020
(their teamwork is just perfect.)

1264
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.460
You don't exercise?

1265
01:05:02.259 --> 01:05:03.399
- Exercise? - Yes.

1266
01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.230
(At this early hour?)

1267
01:05:06.299 --> 01:05:08.569
There are a few exercises you need to do for acting.

1268
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.299
You can just do them to stay healthy as well.

1269
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.669
I'd like to teach you. Will you be able to follow what I do?

1270
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.609
- Yes, of course. - Good. All right, then.

1271
01:05:19.239 --> 01:05:21.080
Then come sit here with me facing this wall.

1272
01:05:21.379 --> 01:05:23.250
- There? - Yes. Come sit right here.

1273
01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:26.819
Lean your back against it. Yes, sit right there.

1274
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:28.750
That's it. Sit cross legged like that.

1275
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.790
(They'll stare at the wall...)

1276
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:34.430
(and exercise at this early hour?)

1277
01:05:35.189 --> 01:05:39.060
(6am: Zoning out)

1278
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.799
This is for your mental health.

1279
01:05:41.799 --> 01:05:43.700
(Zoning out is good for training the mind.)

1280
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.210
First, you need to breathe evenly. Breathe in.

1281
01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:51.140
Take air all the way in. Pull in inward as much as you can.

1282
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:53.350
Then breathe out slowly.

1283
01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.180
(Breathing out)

1284
01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.819
- Through the mouth? - Yes, through the mouth.

1285
01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.960
Breathe in through the nose. You can use your mouth too.

1286
01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960
(Glancing)

1287
01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:08.930
(Breathing out)

1288
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:17.640
Reflect on yesterday. Think about what happened, what went wrong,

1289
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.540
what made you happy,

1290
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.339
and what you don't want to remember.

1291
01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:25.239
It could be things that exhausted you as well.

1292
01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:28.410
You need to let them all go while you breathe out.

1293
01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:50.600
(What exhausted me)

1294
01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:53.669
Does this exercise help you stay energized throughout the day?

1295
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:55.439
- Does it help with acting too? - Yes, it does.

1296
01:06:55.439 --> 01:06:59.580
What I just showed you is how to relax your body through breathing.

1297
01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:01.109
- I see. - Through...

1298
01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:05.379
breathing out like this, you can get rid of mind chatter.

1299
01:07:07.419 --> 01:07:10.089
- You see these flowers, right? - Yes.

1300
01:07:10.089 --> 01:07:13.430
Train your breathing and mind until this becomes...

1301
01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.060
a completely blank wall.

1302
01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.629
Until this becomes a blank wall?

1303
01:07:18.629 --> 01:07:19.969
Until it looks like the flowers are gone.

1304
01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:22.370
(Until the flowers are gone?)

1305
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:24.600
You see all these flowers here, right?

1306
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.899
(Train your mind so that...)

1307
01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:30.710
(the flowers are no longer visible to you.)

1308
01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:32.879
- There are too many of them. - Right.

1309
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:33.980
- I know. - Yes.

1310
01:07:34.109 --> 01:07:35.250
- There is a lot of flowers. - Yes.

1311
01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:36.850
Try to erase them one by one.

1312
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.580
You need to use your mind.

1313
01:07:38.919 --> 01:07:42.290
Keep telling yourself that there are no flowers on the wall.

1314
01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:45.219
(Keep telling yourself that there are no flowers on the wall.)

1315
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.060
(The flowers are so visible.)

1316
01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.529
You don't need to do anything with your body.

1317
01:07:50.899 --> 01:07:52.259
Just let it all go.

1318
01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.469
If you relax like this, your shoulders will drop first.

1319
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:57.870
Now, your body has no purpose.

1320
01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.540
It doesn't need to do anything.

1321
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:01.770
- I see. - After that,

1322
01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:03.980
keep telling yourself that there are no flowers.

1323
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:05.739
"There's nothing."

1324
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:07.980
"It's a complete blank like a white field of snow."

1325
01:08:08.279 --> 01:08:09.680
"It's like a blank piece of paper."

1326
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.620
"It's like the blue sky. There's nothing on it."

1327
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.549
"There's absolutely nothing. There are no flowers."

1328
01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.219
"There's nothing. All I see is pink."

1329
01:08:19.219 --> 01:08:20.529
(You don't see anything right now.)

1330
01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.660
Keep on erasing everything you see,

1331
01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.129
and it'll eventually become a white field of snow.

1332
01:08:25.129 --> 01:08:26.529
It'll become a blank piece of paper.

1333
01:08:28.469 --> 01:08:29.500
"There's nothing."

1334
01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:31.069
"There's something."

1335
01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.569
"There's nothing."

1336
01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:33.939
"It's colorless now."

1337
01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:37.980
"The flowers are disappearing." You need to come up with your own steps.

1338
01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:43.680
- Excuse me for a second, Master. - All right.

1339
01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:44.779
I'll be right back.

1340
01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.120
Seung Gi.

1341
01:08:50.589 --> 01:08:51.589
- Seung Gi. - Yes.

1342
01:08:51.719 --> 01:08:53.489
Master wants to teach us...

1343
01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:55.529
- his breathing exercise now. - Okay.

1344
01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.660
Yes, right now.

1345
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.700
(Brothers, let's breathe together every moment.)

1346
01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.899
Master wants to teach us his breathing exercise.

1347
01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.969
- Sang Yun. - Yes.

1348
01:09:05.739 --> 01:09:06.739
(Breathing in)

1349
01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:08.410
(Breathing out)

1350
01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:12.850
Now. Right now.

1351
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.710
Come right now. Come on.

1352
01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:16.480
(Brothers, I invite you to the field of flowers.)

1353
01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.620
- I thought everyone should learn. - Do they want to learn it too?

1354
01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:23.390
Yes, they said they want to learn.

1355
01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:25.160
I see. Come here, guys.

1356
01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.560
Good. The three of you should do it together.

1357
01:09:31.259 --> 01:09:36.569
- You look better with messy hair. - Good morning, Master.

1358
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:40.910
Did you have a good dream?

1359
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.239
(He looks especially handsome in the morning.)

1360
01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.439
(We hear his signature laughter again.)

1361
01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.310
It means that you were tired. We have dreams when we're tired.

1362
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.419
(Tired? Not at all. I feel so well-rested.)

1363
01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:57.620
(These guys look a little more presentable than he does.)

1364
01:09:59.689 --> 01:10:00.890
Master just taught me...

1365
01:10:01.759 --> 01:10:05.060
how to do his breathing exercise.

1366
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.469
He says it's incredibly helpful for acting.

1367
01:10:08.469 --> 01:10:12.270
- Really? - It also relaxes the mind.

1368
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.379
It's how you can train your soul. Shall I call it soul training?

1369
01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:19.750
(Soul Training)

1370
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.549
I'll explain. You get makeup done in hair and makeup rooms, right?

1371
01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.620
As soon as you open the door to the studio,

1372
01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.149
you enter the world of your soul. It's the place...

1373
01:10:28.649 --> 01:10:31.259
you've been picturing for the character you're playing.

1374
01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.960
So what you should do is look into the mirror like this...

1375
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.000
and ask yourself, "May I swap my soul now?"

1376
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.700
("May I swap my soul now?")

1377
01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:45.069
Then from looks to everything else,

1378
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.310
Choi Bool Am must stay inside the mirror.

1379
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.939
(He leaves himself inside the mirror for a little while.)

1380
01:10:49.939 --> 01:10:52.379
I must focus on the soul I've created inside my head...

1381
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.379
and enter the studio with it.

1382
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:55.950
I carry it with me,

1383
01:10:56.379 --> 01:10:58.180
and I tell myself, "Bool Am, take a break for a few minutes."

1384
01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:02.989
That's why you need this training.

1385
01:11:04.759 --> 01:11:09.460
You need to be able to think that whatever you see doesn't exist.

1386
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.569
Also, let your body free. Think that it doesn't have any purpose now.

1387
01:11:14.569 --> 01:11:15.870
(Empty your mind and body.)

1388
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:18.299
Look at what's in front of you. There must be some objects.

1389
01:11:18.299 --> 01:11:20.040
- There are flowers on the wall. - Yes.

1390
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:22.069
Just stare at the flowers without thinking anything.

1391
01:11:36.989 --> 01:11:39.290
Then try erasing them one by one.

1392
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:41.859
(Try erasing the flowers 1 by 1.)

1393
01:11:43.859 --> 01:11:45.160
- Erase them? - Yes, erase all the flowers.

1394
01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.000
This is hard. I've erased about two but couldn't remove all of them.

1395
01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.799
Tell yourself that there are no flowers on the wall.

1396
01:11:52.339 --> 01:11:54.540
They'll disappear if you keep telling yourself they don't exist.

1397
01:11:55.339 --> 01:11:57.379
"There are no flowers. The flowers don't exist."

1398
01:11:57.710 --> 01:12:00.109
"I don't see any color. It looks like a white piece of paper."

1399
01:12:00.509 --> 01:12:02.750
Then it'll really become a blank piece of paper...

1400
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.219
that looks like a white field of snow as if there's nothing on it.

1401
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.859
Oh, gosh! I just saw all white.

1402
01:12:11.719 --> 01:12:13.629
I feel like I'm just spacing out.

1403
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:15.859
(That's what it feels like on your first attempt.)

1404
01:12:15.859 --> 01:12:17.359
Master, then does the wall...

1405
01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.799
really look blank to you even with your eyes open?

1406
01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:24.100
You don't even need to hear my answer to that question.

1407
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.000
The process is unique to everyone.

1408
01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.910
Just focus on making it look blank.

1409
01:12:28.009 --> 01:12:30.210
- Gosh, it's so hard. - It's very hard, isn't it?

1410
01:12:30.439 --> 01:12:32.279
Once you erase everything on it,

1411
01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:34.279
you have to draw new flowers.

1412
01:12:34.279 --> 01:12:35.580
(You must draw new flowers on it.)

1413
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.879
(We haven't even erased the flowers that are on it now.)

1414
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:40.319
"Oh, I see rose of Sharon blooming."

1415
01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:42.689
"I see red roses too."

1416
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.160
In order to enable yourself do that with your imagination alone,

1417
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:47.859
you must focus on your goal for now, which is erasing all the flowers.

1418
01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.430
A blank piece of paper.

1419
01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.969
You must erase everything first...

1420
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:56.770
so that only a little bit of red can turn the whole wall red.

1421
01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.469
Even a little bit of blue will turn it red.

1422
01:13:00.569 --> 01:13:01.609
"It's turning red."

1423
01:13:02.469 --> 01:13:04.180
"The stigma has turned red."

1424
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.080
"Even the stigma is red now."

1425
01:13:07.379 --> 01:13:09.080
"My, what a beautiful color."

1426
01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.279
(What a gorgeous color.)

1427
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:14.790
Gosh, I can't do it at all.

1428
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:16.989
I must say...

1429
01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:19.890
It'd be a lie if I say that I saw it turning red.

1430
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.299
But after imagining it and concentrating for a while,

1431
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:25.060
I didn't actually see red,

1432
01:13:25.129 --> 01:13:28.169
but I felt it gradually turning red, then it stopped just now.

1433
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.270
- Me too. - Right? You must know what I mean.

1434
01:13:31.469 --> 01:13:32.569
(The advanced class)

1435
01:13:32.569 --> 01:13:33.609
- Good. - I see.

1436
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:37.439
It comes down to training yourself to draw the picture in your mind.

1437
01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:41.480
I trained myself like this back when...

1438
01:13:42.279 --> 01:13:43.549
I was in a drama called "Father".

1439
01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.089
I wasn't in my 40s yet back then. I was 30-something years old,

1440
01:13:48.089 --> 01:13:49.719
but I played a father character in the drama.

1441
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:53.160
I felt that I just couldn't portray the character's aura.

1442
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.700
In other words, I couldn't express the kind of life he's led.

1443
01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.799
(He was too young and inexperienced to portray the father character.)

1444
01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:03.640
No matter how many times I wondered what he would've done,

1445
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.910
every gesture looked too contrived.

1446
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:09.879
So I just went to Seoul Station one day,

1447
01:14:10.439 --> 01:14:12.980
sat in front of the station, and started observing passersby...

1448
01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.080
all day long.

1449
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:27.960
The character I had to play was a retired father.

1450
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.100
(To be able to draw the image of the father in his head)

1451
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.899
At the station, I saw a father who was saying goodbye to his daughter.

1452
01:14:33.029 --> 01:14:34.200
I saw all sorts of things.

1453
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.930
(He observed countless fathers in real life.)

1454
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.169
And I jotted down what I saw.

1455
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.969
"Most of them have hunched backs."

1456
01:14:41.169 --> 01:14:42.939
"Most of them walk and move slowly."

1457
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:47.879
"Older people tend to look at the ground when they walk."

1458
01:14:48.279 --> 01:14:49.750
I wrote down everything I observed.

1459
01:14:50.049 --> 01:14:53.919
Then I tried to make myself appear like the fathers I observed.

1460
01:14:53.919 --> 01:14:56.520
(His soul training is what created his signature father character.)

1461
01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.259
I feel lazy. I'm tired too. I'll just splash some water on myself.

1462
01:14:59.319 --> 01:15:01.390
- Then take off your undershirt. - Oh, boy.

1463
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:03.060
(He played a 65-year-old father...)

1464
01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:08.129
(when he was just over 40.)

1465
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:10.969
(He lost his father...)

1466
01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:13.270
(when he was 8 years old.)

1467
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:16.609
I missed my father as I was playing those father characters.

1468
01:15:17.009 --> 01:15:20.410
"I wish I had a father like that."

1469
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.750
I'm sure I thought to myself once in a while.

1470
01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:28.919
It's the most beautiful emotion, longing.

1471
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.930
That's the end. It must be boring for the morning.

1472
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:34.259
(Master acts a father with longing.)

1473
01:15:34.259 --> 01:15:35.759
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1474
01:15:37.029 --> 01:15:38.899
- I woke you up. - It's okay.

1475
01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:40.230
It was great.

1476
01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:41.230
(Go look in the mirror now.)

1477
01:15:41.399 --> 01:15:42.529
As an actor.

1478
01:15:42.529 --> 01:15:44.239
It's not easy to have such...

1479
01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:46.739
- a good lecture in the morning. - I was being silly in the morning.

1480
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:51.279
(Seung Gi...)

1481
01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:55.109
(comes back to the room.)

1482
01:15:57.649 --> 01:16:00.120
(He sits down.)

1483
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.390
The flower blooms.

1484
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:09.529
It's snowing heavily.

1485
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:16.270
It's not easy.

1486
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.700
(His eyes hurt because he opened them so wide.)

1487
01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:22.839
(It didn't snow as Seung Gi wished,)

1488
01:16:23.109 --> 01:16:25.680
(but someone's coming through snow.)

1489
01:16:27.009 --> 01:16:30.080
(Light footsteps...)

1490
01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.480
(with heavy hands)

1491
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.250
What kind of father were you?

1492
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:35.620
(No one expected him.)

1493
01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.620
I'm curious.

1494
01:16:37.989 --> 01:16:40.489
(A guest who starts the day)

1495
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.259
(My...)

1496
01:16:44.259 --> 01:16:46.330
(goodness.)

1497
01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:49.640
- Did you sleep well? - Hello.

1498
01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:51.270
Did you sleep well?

1499
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.969
- Hello. - Hello.

1500
01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:58.239
(Guan Yu is here.)

1501
01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:02.410
(Everyone stands up.)

1502
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.750
- Did you sleep well? - You're having breakfast?

1503
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:05.649
- Goodness. - Did you sleep well?

1504
01:17:05.649 --> 01:17:07.420
How did you get here?

1505
01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.160
I brought something for you for breakfast.

1506
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.760
- You didn't have to. - You didn't have to.

1507
01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:14.460
- Goodness. - You didn't have to.

1508
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:19.429
(Goodness.)

1509
01:17:19.429 --> 01:17:20.630
(Goodness.)

1510
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.069
- He brought laver and stuff. - Goodness.

1511
01:17:22.069 --> 01:17:23.069
(Goodness.)

1512
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.899
I have nothing else to say but goodness.

1513
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.410
- Goodness. - Sit down.

1514
01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:28.710
I heard you have nothing to eat.

1515
01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:29.840
(He wanted to feed them before they leave.)

1516
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.239
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1517
01:17:31.239 --> 01:17:33.279
- Sit down. - I should go.

1518
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:35.309
Why? Stay.

1519
01:17:35.309 --> 01:17:36.319
Did you have breakfast?

1520
01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.479
It's fine. Sit down. I'm going to leave.

1521
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:40.849
Thank you.

1522
01:17:40.849 --> 01:17:42.050
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1523
01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:44.160
(He doesn't even look back,)

1524
01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:46.960
(so they wouldn't feel uncomfortable.)

1525
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.700
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1526
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:50.899
(He's so cool.)

1527
01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:53.470
He likes you so much.

1528
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:54.899
I know.

1529
01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.840
- Take it out. Let's eat. - He came here in this weather.

1530
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.840
(He brought breakfast for the master in this cold weather.)

1531
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.439
- It's rice. - Rice?

1532
01:17:59.439 --> 01:18:00.910
- Warm rice. - Who wants rice?

1533
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.809
It's warm.

1534
01:18:02.809 --> 01:18:04.710
(With just cooked rice...)

1535
01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:06.210
- He brought laver. - Laver.

1536
01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:08.050
He wrapped it in foil.

1537
01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.179
(Luxuriously wrapped laver)

1538
01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:11.420
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

1539
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.019
- Enjoy. - Good job.

1540
01:18:13.019 --> 01:18:16.989
It's great breakfast.

1541
01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.359
It's a buffet.

1542
01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.429
I can eat everything.

1543
01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.460
(Abundant breakfast buffet with salted crabs and garlic stalk)

1544
01:18:28.429 --> 01:18:29.429
It's delicious.

1545
01:18:29.429 --> 01:18:32.939
The level of freshness of kimchi isn't from the fridge.

1546
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:34.470
- It's from the crock. - Yes.

1547
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:35.910
It's homemade.

1548
01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:38.139
Kimchi is good with everything.

1549
01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:41.450
This is Korea's meal.

1550
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.450
(While they enjoy Hongcheon meal with love,)

1551
01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:45.819
(snow is being removed outside.)

1552
01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.220
I heard Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei...

1553
01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:52.960
said snow must be removed.

1554
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:54.489
- I think... - That's amazing.

1555
01:18:56.929 --> 01:18:59.300
(Three brothers' last surprise)

1556
01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.970
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1557
01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:04.069
(Instead of a flower bed, it's a well-polished sand road.)

1558
01:19:04.069 --> 01:19:06.840
The air is so fresh. Did you have a good sleep?

1559
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.040
(They go on their way to Seoul.)

1560
01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:10.279
We slept well in such a warm place thanks to you.

1561
01:19:10.279 --> 01:19:11.340
By the way,

1562
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.080
I'm glad you brought rice for them.

1563
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:15.849
- Goodness. - With kimchi and rice.

1564
01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.220
- We slept well. - Seoul won't be that cold now.

1565
01:19:18.479 --> 01:19:19.489
Thank you.

1566
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:21.149
I'll call you.

1567
01:19:22.019 --> 01:19:23.059
Thank you very much.

1568
01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:26.090
- Bye, Liu Bei. I'll call you. - Okay.

1569
01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:28.929
Thank you for coming here.

1570
01:19:28.929 --> 01:19:31.460
You're doing a good job even though you live alone.

1571
01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.729
- It was clean. - You don't need to worry.

1572
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.269
- Don't worry. - Bye.

1573
01:19:37.269 --> 01:19:39.439
Let's leave without turning back.

1574
01:19:39.439 --> 01:19:40.470
- Yes. - Okay.

1575
01:19:41.239 --> 01:19:42.439
Bye. Bye, Guan Yu.

1576
01:19:43.609 --> 01:19:45.080
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1577
01:19:48.679 --> 01:19:50.050
(I missed you for a long time.)

1578
01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:51.279
- Bye. - Bye.

1579
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:57.290
(We couldn't meet for a long time.)

1580
01:19:57.489 --> 01:20:00.059
(I was grateful...)

1581
01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.729
(that you were doing well.)

1582
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.429
("Hello" by Na Tae Joo)

1583
01:20:06.769 --> 01:20:08.700
(They're drunk with alcohol...)

1584
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.139
(and with romance.)

1585
01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:12.470
(Look at that.)

1586
01:20:13.569 --> 01:20:16.939
(The last training with students who enjoy...)

1587
01:20:16.939 --> 01:20:19.340
(arts and drinks begins.)

1588
01:20:20.179 --> 01:20:22.380
(Last romance in Myeong-dong)

1589
01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.620
I only saw the master...

1590
01:20:24.179 --> 01:20:25.750
on TV.

1591
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:29.620
He's someone I can only meet on a book.

1592
01:20:29.889 --> 01:20:34.229
Choi Bool Am series...

1593
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.760
- Oh, Choi Bool Am series. - It was famous.

1594
01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.760
Everyone knows.

1595
01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.300
I used to memorize it and use it.

1596
01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:43.099
(Empty jokes were a big hit in the early 90s.)

1597
01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:44.439
I was happy.

1598
01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:46.769
How did Choi Bool Am series...

1599
01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.170
begin at first?

1600
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:49.170
(How did Choi Bool Am series start at first?)

1601
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:52.080
If I were to tell you from the beginning,

1602
01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.580
there are even movies now.

1603
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:59.649
We became democratic in 1987.

1604
01:20:59.649 --> 01:21:00.649
- Yes. - Yes.

1605
01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.859
All the students got up...

1606
01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:05.660
to change the world.

1607
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:09.429
(Countless students and young people...)

1608
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.000
(went out to the streets...)

1609
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.970
(for freedom we enjoy now.)

1610
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.200
Back then,

1611
01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.739
everyone was tensed.

1612
01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:21.739
There was no humor. One day, my friend said...

1613
01:21:21.739 --> 01:21:23.910
my stories are famous in schools.

1614
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:26.609
I asked him what was going on.

1615
01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:30.380
He said it's a satire...

1616
01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.050
with you in it.

1617
01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:33.050
(Choi Bool Am series is a satire with him as a character.)

1618
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:34.120
That's what he told me.

1619
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:37.760
Was Choi Bool Am series influenced by...

1620
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.529
democracy?

1621
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:42.960
It was created by jokes of students.

1622
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.059
(A small laughter in the dark)

1623
01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.170
The first joke was 63 Building.

1624
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:48.870
- 63 Building is the first joke? - Yes.

1625
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:52.099
Choi Bool Am series told by Choi Bool Am himself.

1626
01:21:52.099 --> 01:21:53.340
(The 1st episode of Choi Bool Am series)

1627
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.639
I was playing a table tennis on rooftop of 63 Building.

1628
01:21:56.639 --> 01:21:58.510
- On 63 Building? - Yes. Then he hit...

1629
01:21:58.510 --> 01:22:00.849
the ball too hard...

1630
01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:03.979
that it flew outside the building.

1631
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.050
Choi Bool Am said "Gosh",

1632
01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:10.090
then he walked down 63 building.

1633
01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:12.189
He picked up the ball...

1634
01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.590
and went up the building.

1635
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:16.059
- By walking. - Okay.

1636
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:19.970
What do you think he said as he walked in?

1637
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:20.970
(What did Choi Bool Am say as he walked up?)

1638
01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:22.269
- What was it? - Wait.

1639
01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:24.139
(What is it?)

1640
01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:26.370
(What did he say?)

1641
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:29.580
As he gasped,

1642
01:22:29.739 --> 01:22:31.010
he said, "It's 1 to 0."

1643
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:33.779
"It's 1 to 0."

1644
01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:34.950
(Laughing)

1645
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.010
There's one.

1646
01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:37.519
(People born in the 80s find it funny.)

1647
01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:38.819
But then...

1648
01:22:38.819 --> 01:22:41.420
(Seong Jae who was born in 1995 doesn't understand why it's funny.)

1649
01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.920
It's the old joke.

1650
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.429
Why are you so quiet, Seong Jae?

1651
01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.800
(Actually...)

1652
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.130
Actually...

1653
01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:53.099
I've never heard of Choi Bool Am series before.

1654
01:22:53.099 --> 01:22:55.069
- He's very young. - He doesn't know.

1655
01:22:55.069 --> 01:22:56.769
He turned 23 this year.

1656
01:22:56.899 --> 01:22:58.439
- I'm 24. - 24.

1657
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.670
I lived almost four times more than you.

1658
01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:04.210
(Laughing)

1659
01:23:05.179 --> 01:23:06.979
Did you just laugh?

1660
01:23:07.279 --> 01:23:08.279
It's not green onion.

1661
01:23:08.279 --> 01:23:10.019
(Laughing)

1662
01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:12.620
(The master's signature laughter)

1663
01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.989
- It is... - I can't do it.

1664
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:16.760
(Even the master's laughter...)

1665
01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.760
Right. I'm only making a sound of breath.

1666
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.760
(Young men try to copy it.)

1667
01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.760
I don't make the sound.

1668
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:22.590
(I think I know this.)

1669
01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.170
(While they're laughing,)

1670
01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.639
(they arrived in Myeong-dong.)

1671
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.939
- It's crowded in Myeong-dong. - Myeong-dong.

1672
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:35.210
How long has it been since you walked in Myeong-dong?

1673
01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:36.210
(They walk Myeong-dong streets with the romantic master.)

1674
01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:39.239
- I think it's my first time. - Me too. I think...

1675
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:43.620
it's been almost 10 years since I walked Myeong-dong.

1676
01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.220
- 10 years? - It's been 10 years.

1677
01:23:45.819 --> 01:23:48.290
- Do you come here often? - I do.

1678
01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.620
- You should come here often. - Okay.

1679
01:23:51.989 --> 01:23:54.090
It's the base of cultural arts.

1680
01:23:55.389 --> 01:23:58.500
(Myeong-dong is the base of cultural arts?)

1681
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.569
(Myeong-dong we didn't know)

1682
01:24:02.569 --> 01:24:03.769
What kind of alley is this?

1683
01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:07.040
I didn't even know there was an alley here.

1684
01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.510
You don't come here when you come to Myeong-dong.

1685
01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:12.639
- I didn't know about this alley. - I didn't know until now.

1686
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.450
(Like a mirage...)

1687
01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:17.519
- It's so nice. - Are we going in here?

1688
01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:18.649
(It's the final destination today.)

1689
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:19.819
Let's go in.

1690
01:24:21.019 --> 01:24:22.019
(When you pass the wooden stairs...)

1691
01:24:22.019 --> 01:24:23.660
What is this?

1692
01:24:25.989 --> 01:24:27.130
Each step...

1693
01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:30.160
has history, right?

1694
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:35.269
Is this still open?

1695
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.370
(The last romance the master prepared is...)

1696
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:41.939
I didn't know there was a place like this.

1697
01:24:41.939 --> 01:24:43.040
I had no idea.

1698
01:24:43.309 --> 01:24:45.739
I feel like I'm on a time machine.

1699
01:24:45.739 --> 01:24:47.050
(It's where the master's romance began in the 1960s.)

1700
01:24:47.779 --> 01:24:50.979
(Eunseong in Myeong-dong was loved by cultural artists at the time.)

1701
01:24:50.979 --> 01:24:52.649
That's called Eunseong.

1702
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:55.389
My mother loved him...

1703
01:24:55.389 --> 01:24:56.620
among foreign actors.

1704
01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.019
Your mother?

1705
01:24:58.019 --> 01:25:00.059
My mother. That's Eunseong here.

1706
01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:01.330
(Eunseong)

1707
01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:03.330
(Bar Eunseong in the 60s...)

1708
01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:05.899
(plus the master's mother. They're calculating.)

1709
01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:08.029
Did your mother build this?

1710
01:25:08.029 --> 01:25:09.739
That place.

1711
01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.340
Oh, that place.

1712
01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.910
Your mother built Eunseong?

1713
01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.040
Right.

1714
01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:17.380
- I see. - That's awesome.

1715
01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.010
(The members are surprised because...)

1716
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:20.679
I didn't know.

1717
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:25.550
(They stumbled upon a memorial stone on the street of Myeong-dong.)

1718
01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:27.720
(Former Site of Eunseong Tavern)

1719
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.319
- You said you like Park In Hwan. - "Including Byeon Yeoung Ro,"

1720
01:25:29.319 --> 01:25:31.359
"Park In Hwan, Jeon Hye Rin, Lim Man Seob, and so on,"

1721
01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:33.460
"many artists and cultural figures gathered at this tavern."

1722
01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:36.059
"Lee Bong Gu used to be called Count Myeong-dong."

1723
01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:37.130
(Memories rush back.)

1724
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:42.300
(In order to raise her son by herself as a single mother,)

1725
01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:46.840
(his mother ran the makgeolli tavern, Eunseong.)

1726
01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.269
(What did the master see here growing up?)

1727
01:25:48.269 --> 01:25:51.179
- From poets, - Right.

1728
01:25:51.239 --> 01:25:54.950
writers, and artists to directors and actors,

1729
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.979
all artistically inclined people used to gather and hang out here.

1730
01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:00.950
They turned Myeong-dong into an artistic, cultural neighborhood.

1731
01:26:02.389 --> 01:26:03.660
- Really? - Yes.

1732
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.519
It's a historic spot.

1733
01:26:05.519 --> 01:26:06.760
(It must've affected him a lot.)

1734
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:08.929
- I think we... - He looks so familiar.

1735
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:11.760
- Haven't we seen him in textbooks? - Yes, that's right.

1736
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.760
(All renowned artists are here.)

1737
01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.330
This is Cheon Sang Byeong. He was ill.

1738
01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.069
He's known as the poorest poet.

1739
01:26:18.769 --> 01:26:20.809
He always wore a tie though.

1740
01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:21.809
(He always wore a tie.)

1741
01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:25.040
But his dress shirt... What is this called?

1742
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.679
- Collars. - Yes, collars. It was...

1743
01:26:27.309 --> 01:26:29.519
so dirty. I saw it.

1744
01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.319
But he always made sure to wear a dress shirt with a tie.

1745
01:26:33.319 --> 01:26:35.819
- He tried to look presentable. - He really did.

1746
01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:38.590
- It shows how romantic he was. - Right.

1747
01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.689
- It's very old-fashioned. - Exactly.

1748
01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.200
She just wanted to support those who were pursuing creative paths.

1749
01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:46.130
She had no interest in making money.

1750
01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:48.500
When my mother passed away,

1751
01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:51.599
I found a crate.

1752
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:55.639
- It was filled with unpaid tabs. - I see.

1753
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:58.910
- That many people kept tabs? - Yes, practically everyone did.

1754
01:26:58.979 --> 01:27:02.109
People could do that even though everyone was poorer back then.

1755
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:05.349
Everyone is better off these days financially,

1756
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.920
but no business would do that for customers.

1757
01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:11.120
When I saw that, I thought that I'd become rich.

1758
01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.989
- Because people owed money. - Exactly, they had to pay.

1759
01:27:14.059 --> 01:27:15.330
But when I went through them,

1760
01:27:15.729 --> 01:27:17.260
I didn't recognize any name.

1761
01:27:19.029 --> 01:27:21.470
Glasses, Big Nose, Mr. Tall.

1762
01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:25.769
It was all nicknames. Only my mother knew who they were.

1763
01:27:25.769 --> 01:27:29.939
She did that on purpose to protect their privacy.

1764
01:27:29.939 --> 01:27:31.279
It's a famous story.

1765
01:27:31.939 --> 01:27:33.679
- So... - Nowadays, you'd be required...

1766
01:27:33.679 --> 01:27:35.279
to bring a copy of your social security card.

1767
01:27:35.279 --> 01:27:37.120
- Totally. - I'm sure of it.

1768
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.019
(They couldn't give up on romance even though they were poor.)

1769
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:44.660
(Just like the literary figures at Eunseong in the 60s,)

1770
01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:47.929
(let's immerse ourselves...)

1771
01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:55.399
(in a little bit of romance today.)

1772
01:27:56.970 --> 01:28:01.439
(Everyone is trying to come up with an idea for a poem.)

1773
01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.040
Master, I actually...

1774
01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:07.349
Yesterday,

1775
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:09.950
when we met for the first time in the birch forest,

1776
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.519
you recited a poem for us.

1777
01:28:13.519 --> 01:28:15.489
(He recited Park In Hwan's "As Time Passes" for them.)

1778
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:20.090
(The poem in the master's heart)

1779
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:25.000
("As Time Passes" by Park In Hwan)

1780
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:28.399
"Love goes away,"

1781
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.370
"but your past stays."

1782
01:28:32.939 --> 01:28:34.639
"I've forgotten her name,"

1783
01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:37.979
"but her eyes and lips are still vivid in my heart."

1784
01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:42.450
"They're still in this cold heart of mine."

1785
01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:45.120
(They're still in this cold heart of mine.)

1786
01:28:46.389 --> 01:28:49.450
After reciting the poem,

1787
01:28:49.450 --> 01:28:51.359
you told us that it was made into a song as well,

1788
01:28:51.489 --> 01:28:52.859
so I actually looked it up.

1789
01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.359
(You looked it up without telling us?)

1790
01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:57.729
- I see. - So...

1791
01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:01.700
- I prepared a little something. - My gosh, you did?

1792
01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.370
- Yes. - I'm so proud of you.

1793
01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:06.210
It won't be perfect, but I'd like to sing the song for you.

1794
01:29:07.069 --> 01:29:09.939
- Hey, when did you prepare it? - When did you have time for that?

1795
01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.279
He probably practiced underneath his blanket.

1796
01:29:12.439 --> 01:29:14.510
- I'll keep it short. - Okay, let's hear it.

1797
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:15.510
(The sentimentalist, Seong Jae,)

1798
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:18.720
(sings his 2018 version of "As Time Passes".)

1799
01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.989
(He gets into the mood.)

1800
01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:31.830
(Love goes away)

1801
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:34.000
(But your past stays)

1802
01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:37.800
(Seong Jae's sweet voice fills up the whole place.)

1803
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:50.450
I wouldn't make people look at me like that. I'd do this instead.

1804
01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:52.550
(What did I do wrong?)

1805
01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.590
You'd drink with your head dropped like this.

1806
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.660
(We can tell he studied directing.)

1807
01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:58.359
He would've sung like that, don't you think?

1808
01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:01.189
- All alone in his lonely world. - Yes, you're right.

1809
01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:05.429
Oh, how about we have Seong Jae try singing like that this time?

1810
01:30:05.429 --> 01:30:07.229
- He should sing quietly. - I'm not trying to tease him.

1811
01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:09.370
- We'll see how you pull this off. - Okay.

1812
01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:11.239
- All right. - Sing with your head dropped.

1813
01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.300
- Put that away. - I'll clean the table.

1814
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.639
Good. Drop your head now.

1815
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:15.970
- More. - You look so cool now.

1816
01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:18.109
- No, he should just... - You look really cool now.

1817
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:19.910
Just look at the ceiling.

1818
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:22.210
No, not like that. You're trying too hard to show your face.

1819
01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:23.720
You should shed some tears, don't you think?

1820
01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.950
(You should shed some tears, don't you think?)

1821
01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.420
He has to cry too?

1822
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.819
- Right now, he's... - Get into the mood.

1823
01:30:29.819 --> 01:30:31.689
- If this was a part of a movie, - Right.

1824
01:30:31.689 --> 01:30:33.729
he should be crying now as it'd be the final scene.

1825
01:30:33.729 --> 01:30:34.830
(He's now a poor poet in Myeong-dong.)

1826
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:37.029
If Seong Jae is not comfortable with crying,

1827
01:30:37.029 --> 01:30:38.960
how about we move on to the next scene with you crying?

1828
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.830
We'll cut this scene...

1829
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:43.040
- and show Sang Yun shedding tears. - Yes, good idea.

1830
01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.040
(Sponsored by One Drop of Tears)

1831
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.870
But if you're that sentimental, I'd be like, "What's going on?"

1832
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:49.269
(The master walks up to Seong Jae right at that moment.)

1833
01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.840
I'll be the director now. Rest your face on your arm.

1834
01:30:52.439 --> 01:30:53.510
(How will he direct it?)

1835
01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:54.649
- Okay. - With your face down.

1836
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.920
Tilt your head a little so that your face can show. All right.

1837
01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.720
(Park In Hwan is drunk and passed out.)

1838
01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.620
- Your hair too. - Master, are you grabbing his hair?

1839
01:31:02.819 --> 01:31:04.790
(It's a little sacrifice Seong Jae has to make.)

1840
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:06.960
- Are you pulling his hair out? - No, just like this.

1841
01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:08.660
His hair... He grabbed his hair.

1842
01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:10.859
(It looks like he's been drinking for the last few days.)

1843
01:31:10.859 --> 01:31:12.229
Should my eyes look a little drunk?

1844
01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.370
Yes, they should. That's it. Great.

1845
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:17.069
By now, he's probably regretting singing that song.

1846
01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:18.899
Hush.

1847
01:31:19.639 --> 01:31:21.439
(Attention, everyone!)

1848
01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:25.040
(In 1956, the 30-year-old poet, Park In Hwan,)

1849
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.149
(wrote this poem a week before he died.)

1850
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.979
That looks good. Even your lungs hurt now.

1851
01:31:29.979 --> 01:31:34.220
("As Time Passes")

1852
01:31:38.319 --> 01:31:42.630
(Love goes away)

1853
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:48.029
(But your past stays)

1854
01:31:48.029 --> 01:31:52.569
(The lake on summer days)

1855
01:31:52.569 --> 01:31:57.410
(The park in autumn)

1856
01:31:57.410 --> 01:32:01.210
(On that bench)

1857
01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:08.889
(Leaves fall and pile up)

1858
01:32:08.889 --> 01:32:13.760
(Covered in the leaves)

1859
01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:19.470
(Even if our love)

1860
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:25.500
(Even if it disappears)

1861
01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:29.880
(In this cold)

1862
01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:34.649
(Heart of mine)

1863
01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:39.319
(You'll always stay)

1864
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:44.590
(Everyone feels like...)

1865
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:52.160
(they just saw the poet, Park In Hwan, on that day in 1956.)

1866
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.200
You did such a great job.

1867
01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:59.370
(You did such a great job.)

1868
01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.279
You're really... You're actually about to cry.

1869
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:08.609
Gosh, but I must say...

1870
01:33:09.349 --> 01:33:10.950
It made me feel... Later on,

1871
01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:15.349
in about 10 or 20 years from now when I'm around his age,

1872
01:33:15.349 --> 01:33:19.359
I'd like to meet you and sing this song for you once again.

1873
01:33:19.359 --> 01:33:22.800
(I'd like to sing this song for you again when I'm around his age.)

1874
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.660
I wonder what it'll feel like then.

1875
01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.800
- Right. - It'll feel very different.

1876
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.569
(The master in Myeong-dong that day)

1877
01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:31.170
(What will it feel like that day?)

1878
01:33:33.269 --> 01:33:36.340
I think this is our final destination.

1879
01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.510
Even without me, the four of you should take some time...

1880
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:44.550
to commemorate our art and culture together.

1881
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:45.920
- Okay. - Good.

1882
01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:49.149
(I hope you always try to keep some romance in your heart.)

1883
01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:55.989
(What's the lesson they learned from the master?)

1884
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.660
The final destination...

1885
01:33:58.859 --> 01:34:01.729
- and parting. Then comes... - I'm Cao Cao.

1886
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:03.370
the deep longing.

1887
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:04.370
(After the day with Master Choi, Lee Sang Yun)

1888
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:06.710
Everything was about longing,

1889
01:34:08.269 --> 01:34:12.210
even the reunion with his friends. They had longed to see each other.

1890
01:34:12.739 --> 01:34:17.019
The fact that they may or may not be able to see each other again...

1891
01:34:17.019 --> 01:34:20.389
really broke my heart to be honest.

1892
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:23.220
That must make them miss each other even more.

1893
01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:24.660
(It broke his heart.)

1894
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:27.330
I think Sang Yun will cry.

1895
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:29.330
No, I won't cry.

1896
01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.330
- You're about to cry. - No, not at all.

1897
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:34.769
- You're tearing up. - I'm... I'm just cold now.

1898
01:34:35.029 --> 01:34:36.470
That's why I'm tearing up.

1899
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.470
What I learned is... To tell you the truth,

1900
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:42.609
when he said that everyone should keep a poem in their heart,

1901
01:34:43.739 --> 01:34:45.540
I thought it was very important.

1902
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:48.979
But it's actually meaningless if...

1903
01:34:49.309 --> 01:34:50.950
you have no friends to share it with.

1904
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:52.649
Without friends that listen to you,

1905
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.620
even that poem becomes useless.

1906
01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.960
So, what I learned is that friends with whom you can share the poem...

1907
01:34:59.559 --> 01:35:01.729
are more valuable than any treasures you can have.

1908
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:05.229
(Everyone should have friends with whom they can share poems.)

1909
01:35:05.559 --> 01:35:08.029
(Finally)

1910
01:35:08.029 --> 01:35:09.330
(A female master is coming.)

1911
01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.670
(Even just her voice makes...)

1912
01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:13.069
(their heart skip because she's their ideal type.)

1913
01:35:13.069 --> 01:35:14.870
(The guy who falls in love easily says that he feels weird.)

1914
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:16.380
(Could this be love?)

1915
01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:18.080
(The bold guys' abduction operation)

1916
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.380
(It began out of their ardent love.)
