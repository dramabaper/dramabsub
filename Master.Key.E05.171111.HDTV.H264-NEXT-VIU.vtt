1
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.589
Among the 12 keys the members have,

2
00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.230
one of the keys is Angel's Master Key,

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830
- and one is Demon's Master Key. - Is this key the Master Key?

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.570
(Angel's Master Key versus Demon's Master Key)

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.429
(The battle becomes fiercer.)

6
00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.740
(Angel tries to help, and Demon tries to lure the players.)

7
00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:21.800
This is so confusing.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.469
One of them is the scariest Demon.

9
00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.079
- Please trust me. - All right.

10
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.809
This is so much fun. Don't get too excited though.

11
00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.019
It's our fifth players of Master Key.

12
00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.480
(The players appear looking handsome.)

13
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.989
(They look happy.)

14
00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.490
- It feels like Min Ho has been... - Why am I standing here?

15
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.960
our existing member all this time.

16
00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.530
It feels like he's a regular member.

17
00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.729
- I think so too. - You did a great job last week.

18
00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.530
I would need about an hour to talk about last week's episode.

19
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.070
- I will focus on today's episode. - Good.

20
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.399
- Gosh. - It was driving me crazy last week.

21
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.409
We have new players today.

22
00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.880
Here are new players for the fifth episode, Hong Bin and Eun Kwang.

23
00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.710
- Eun Kwang. We also have Ye Rin... - Good. Good.

24
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.280
- Ye Rin. - We also have Wendy too.

25
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.979
Why does it feel like Ye Rin has been our member all this time?

26
00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.219
- Se Woon is here too. - It's good.

27
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.459
- Let's go inside then. - Let's go.

28
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.590
- Let's go. - Don't get too excited though.

29
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.159
Take your name plates.

30
00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.000
- Here are your name plates. - I'm surprised.

31
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.629
- Take your name plates. - Is this mine?

32
00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.040
We have to look for the Master Key in the room.

33
00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.069
I will stay here.

34
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.510
- Can I just stand wherever I want? - Yes. You can.

35
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.709
Just stand wherever you want.

36
00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:34.739
- You can stand over there. - The ladies can stand next to me.

37
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.510
I think this is my place.

38
00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.780
- I will take the red. - I will take the yellow then.

39
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.120
- He's in front of me. - Good.

40
00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.890
We have to find Angel and Demon today.

41
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.849
(They finished choosing the keys.)

42
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.090
- This is the start. - This is how it begins.

43
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.390
- This is it? - Players.

44
00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.959
Open the Judgment Cabinet in front of you.

45
00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.030
Open it and you will see the rules for today.

46
00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.099
Among the 12 keys that players have,

47
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.400
there are only two keys that can open the Judgment Cabinet.

48
00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.609
One of them is Angel's Master Key,

49
00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.439
and the other one is Demon's Master Key.

50
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.950
You have to vote for Angel's Master Key.

51
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.289
The players have to look for the player who has Angel's Master Key.

52
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.550
The players who vote for Angel's Master Key...

53
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.590
will equally win the prize.

54
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.099
(The prize will be divided equally.)

55
00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.669
Did you all see what Angel did last week?

56
00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.639
- You shouldn't do the same. - That's right.

57
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.099
I was the Angel last week.

58
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.569
I told everyone that I'm the Angel for eight hours last week.

59
00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.509
- No one believed him. - No one believed me.

60
00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:41.639
(The players who didn't believe Su Geun couldn't win the prize.)

61
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.050
- No one believed him. - You should have tried harder.

62
00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.319
Hyun Moo, it's because you talked too much last week.

63
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.990
He kept saying I wasn't the Angel.

64
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.289
I will treat Su Geun better this week.

65
00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.620
- Why? - He treated me nicely last week.

66
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.860
I'm still hurt.

67
00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:59.759
He's still hurt.

68
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.430
However, if the players vote for Demon's Master Key,

69
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.870
the prize will be multiplied by the number of votes.

70
00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.710
And the Demon will take the whole prize.

71
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.210
No one will be able to win the prize.

72
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.610
(Demon will take the whole prize.)

73
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.250
There will be Angel and Demon.

74
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.080
We all understood the rules, right?

75
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.750
- Demon. - Don't get confused.

76
00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.250
We shouldn't trust anyone.

77
00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.419
You shouldn't trust anyone.

78
00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.020
Everyone will be divided into groups.

79
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.560
- It's more like an individual game. - That's right.

80
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.789
It's an individual game.

81
00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.060
If the players vote for someone...

82
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.669
- who doesn't have the Master Key, - It was Chan Yeol.

83
00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.240
the prize will be multiplied by the number of the votes.

84
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.169
And then the player will take the prize himself.

85
00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.310
The players who vote for the player won't be able to take the prize.

86
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.379
This was good. In last week's episode,

87
00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.280
Chan Yeol of Exo took seven golden keys.

88
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.819
He wasn't the Angel or Demon, but he took seven golden keys.

89
00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.990
- He wasn't any of those. - He took everything.

90
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.889
He kept telling everyone.

91
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.629
He told every player that he was the Angel.

92
00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.500
He lured every player except Hyun Moo.

93
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.460
- Everyone was tricked. - Gosh.

94
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.930
- You shouldn't trust anyone. - It was amazing.

95
00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.900
We thought that...

96
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.539
only Angel and Demon could win the prize.

97
00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.870
But Chan Yeol won the prize last week.

98
00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.639
He beat Angel and Demon last week.

99
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.539
He won the prize.

100
00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.480
The Judgment Cabinet will tell you who has...

101
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.019
Angel's Master Key and Demon's Master Key.

102
00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:28.519
Min Ho is the first one to go.

103
00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.019
(Min Ho will check his key first.)

104
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:32.220
I can't wait.

105
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.490
He was the Demon last week.

106
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.490
All right.

107
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.089
He's experienced.

108
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.259
Is this key...

109
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.360
- the Master Key? - Good.

110
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.529
It can be...

111
00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:44.300
- Just watch. - Let's see.

112
00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:47.199
This is an intense psychological game.

113
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.240
- It is. - I'm so bad at it.

114
00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:53.009
Let's see. Gosh.

115
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.910
(He's experienced in acting.)

116
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.149
What was that?

117
00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:59.779
He's doing it again.

118
00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.149
Is this key the Master Key?

119
00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:04.720
The Judgment Cabinet will show you the answer.

120
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.959
- He's checking. - Show us your face.

121
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.089
He thought for a while.

122
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.000
Are you done checking?

123
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.829
- I don't think he has the key. - What's wrong?

124
00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:14.899
I now have the wings.

125
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.870
(Flapping)

126
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.300
No way. He's trying so hard.

127
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.600
He's trying.

128
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.740
Is this key...

129
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.800
Is this key...

130
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.470
- the Master Key? - The Master Key?

131
00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.939
They are likely to have the keys.

132
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.540
How would we find out if they only show their heads?

133
00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.410
They take so long to read it. They must have the key.

134
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.550
I don't have the Master Key.

135
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.750
You were born...

136
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.790
to be loved

137
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.319
Hallelujah

138
00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:40.620
Look at her.

139
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.990
(How many Angels are there?)

140
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.699
Is this key the Master Key?

141
00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:50.069
This is nerve-wracking.

142
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.839
Look.

143
00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.680
Hong Bin must be Demon.

144
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.540
My key feels heavier than the other keys.

145
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.910
It feels heavy.

146
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.110
What?

147
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.379
- He looks suspicious. - Is he the Demon?

148
00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.319
Is this key the Master Key?

149
00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.589
Is this key the Master Key?

150
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.160
No, he doesn't have one.

151
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.220
(He looks calm.)

152
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.730
- He doesn't have it. - He doesn't.

153
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.899
- Thank you. - He doesn't have one.

154
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.959
He's acting.

155
00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.730
- Is this key the Master Key? - Is this key the Master Key?

156
00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.670
(Laughing)

157
00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:31.069
I have the key.

158
00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.639
I'm satisfied with the answer.

159
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.480
- Are you? - She's satisfied.

160
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.949
- Are you sure? - I've always wanted to do it.

161
00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.579
Is this key the Master Key?

162
00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:40.350
He might have the key.

163
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.220
I want to see it.

164
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.220
I can just go and check the result.

165
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.259
Are you done checking?

166
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.019
- He looks happy. - I think he has one.

167
00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:50.629
He acts a little different than last week.

168
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:52.459
He can't act as Demon if it's his first time.

169
00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:53.600
He looks awkward.

170
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.629
Do I look awkward?

171
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.170
- Is he Demon? - I think he is.

172
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.470
- Is this key the Master Key? - Let's go.

173
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.670
- Show us. - He looks so serious.

174
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.910
There you go.

175
00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:06.779
Yes.

176
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:10.310
- I don't think he has one. - He's so bad at acting.

177
00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:11.910
Do you want to do it again?

178
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.879
- Do you want to do it again? - Next person can check his result.

179
00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:15.120
- He looks flustered. - No. Who's next?

180
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.490
- I don't have one. - Key.

181
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.620
I really don't have the key.

182
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.959
Just watch me.

183
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.759
Is this key the Master Key?

184
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.360
Please.

185
00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.470
We can't see your face.

186
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.870
(Laughing)

187
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.069
(He laughs loudly.)

188
00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:36.040
- He doesn't have one. - No way.

189
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.740
No way.

190
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.709
I can't tell if he has one or not.

191
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.720
You can turn the light off. I'm done checking.

192
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.949
Gosh.

193
00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:52.990
The light went off already.

194
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.689
There's nothing on the screen.

195
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.959
All the players are done checking their keys.

196
00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:03.529
Before we start searching for the Master Keys,

197
00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.399
please go to the locker room to get changed.

198
00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:08.240
Let's go.

199
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.110
What do we do?

200
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.740
(Who has Angel's Master Key?)

201
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.480
I got X on my screen.

202
00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:21.019
Isn't it better if Angel start telling everyone?

203
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.149
- It's me. - Who has Angel's Master Key?

204
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:24.649
- You don't have it. - I have it.

205
00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:26.360
Why are you lying?

206
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.689
I really have the key.

207
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.060
Daniel.

208
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.490
I really have it.

209
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.730
Gosh. Stop it Daniel.

210
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.259
The Angel is watching you.

211
00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.529
I don't want to be the Angel this week.

212
00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:36.800
(A former Angel)

213
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.169
I didn't know I was going to be the Angel again.

214
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.100
He's quiet.

215
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:45.509
He didn't talk much from last week.

216
00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.840
He acts a bit differently today.

217
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.779
- Is he the Demon? - I think so too.

218
00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.850
He might be the one. I think he is the Demon.

219
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.080
(He stays quiet.)

220
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:56.320
Just trust me, please.

221
00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:59.190
You should trust me.

222
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.720
Just trust me.

223
00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:02.629
(Meanwhile)

224
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:05.460
- I really am the Angel. - Just be quiet.

225
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.830
- Please just trust me. - You're so noisy.

226
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.970
Please.

227
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.500
Please just trust me.

228
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.470
- He's joking. - Please just trust me.

229
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.039
I don't want everyone to vote for me.

230
00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:16.269
Hey.

231
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:17.970
Su Geun acted like this last week.

232
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.710
- No. - Yes he did.

233
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.950
I'm telling you the truth. Last week,

234
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.250
everyone in my team voted for different people.

235
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.779
No one voted for Angel or Demon.

236
00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:28.250
That's how Chan Yeol won the prize.

237
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.320
Gosh.

238
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.820
- Let's talk. - I am the Angel.

239
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.360
(Those three move quietly.)

240
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.289
I have the Master Key.

241
00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:39.059
- Be serious. - I really have the key.

242
00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:40.100
Just trust me for once.

243
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.929
Okay. I trust you.

244
00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:44.169
- Are you the Angel or Demon? - I'm Angel.

245
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:45.370
- Really? - Yes.

246
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.840
I'm the Angel too.

247
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.009
Don't lie.

248
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:51.210
Are you trying to trick us?

249
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.639
Why are you here? Go away.

250
00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:55.179
- Hey. - Come here.

251
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:56.350
You are the Demon, right?

252
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.580
I am the Angel.

253
00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:01.120
Why am I the Angel then?

254
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.250
Why do you look so down?

255
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.490
I am the Angel.

256
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.620
Why do you look so down?

257
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.820
I am the Angel.

258
00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:07.620
(Angel)

259
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.289
- He looks like one. - Look at him.

260
00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:10.860
I really am the Angel.

261
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.230
- His eyes say it so. - Is he the Angel?

262
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.669
I could feel that I would have the Master Key today.

263
00:10:15.669 --> 00:10:17.269
- You're lying for sure. - Are you the Angel?

264
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:18.740
I'm telling you the truth.

265
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.899
- Why are you trying so hard? - Just trust me on this.

266
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.639
- I am the Angel. - You failed last week.

267
00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:24.039
Is that why you are trying so hard this week?

268
00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:26.710
- Why are you trying so hard? - I feel pressured as I'm the Angel.

269
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.909
Oh, do you?

270
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.580
(Excited)

271
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.679
Two of you guys are lying then.

272
00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:36.590
(They are both trying so hard. Which keys do they have?)

273
00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:39.159
All right. What should we do?

274
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.789
You have the Master Key, right?

275
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.389
I think he has the Master Key.

276
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.860
I think he has the key.

277
00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:47.700
If you have the key...

278
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.399
If you received O...

279
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.529
So when are you going to tell us that you're the Angel?

280
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.340
I don't think he's the Angel.

281
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.809
- I don't think he has the key. - Should I start telling people?

282
00:10:55.809 --> 00:10:59.610
After I was betrayed last week,

283
00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:01.110
- it's... - What did you get?

284
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.049
useless to tell people at this moment.

285
00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:06.250
I think people will start...

286
00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:08.179
telling everyone...

287
00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:11.490
after the first elimination.

288
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.690
You can tell people earlier.

289
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.590
- Last week... - Hello. I am the Angel.

290
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.629
This is surprising.

291
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.200
You guys can stay here. I will be outside.

292
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:23.629
Demon, you should follow me.

293
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.769
- Demon's following you. - Yes.

294
00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:28.100
- No, I am not the Demon. - I am the Demon.

295
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.710
Tell me why you're saying that you have the Master Key.

296
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.909
- The reasons? - Tell me the reasons.

297
00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:33.179
- Good. You are here too. - I...

298
00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:35.549
don't have to be this enthusiastic if I don't have it.

299
00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:37.049
So are you saying that you are the Angel?

300
00:11:37.049 --> 00:11:38.250
Yes.

301
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.580
I am the Demon.

302
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.620
I don't think you are.

303
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.220
- You are not. - Why are you here?

304
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.019
He's checking on everyone.

305
00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:45.820
- I really am the Angel. - He already knows.

306
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.820
Look. There is a possibility...

307
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.059
that Se Woon is the Angel.

308
00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:50.559
- I was the Angel last week. - Were you?

309
00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:53.299
What do you think is the chance that I can be the Angel this week?

310
00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:55.500
- 0 percent. - 1.2 percent.

311
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.970
1.2 percent.

312
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.970
I am...

313
00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:00.299
- He's the Angel again. - I am the Angel again.

314
00:12:00.299 --> 00:12:01.639
No way.

315
00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.639
- Gosh. - Why?

316
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.110
How can you be the Angel again this week?

317
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:06.179
- I am the Angel. - I am telling you.

318
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.039
I am the Angel.

319
00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.379
We have different roles today.

320
00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:10.480
Why do you say that?

321
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.679
This is what I wanted actually.

322
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:15.820
There is a reason that I called you guys.

323
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.019
There is one thing that I want to tell you guys.

324
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.289
- Just trust me on this. - What is he saying?

325
00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:23.460
The first player...

326
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.789
Hey, let's go.

327
00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:26.129
- Trust me. - Is it this way?

328
00:12:26.129 --> 00:12:27.960
- Trust me. - Let's go.

329
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.970
Daniel looks suspicious.

330
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.840
(Investigation Mission 1)

331
00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:38.470
Trust me.

332
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.610
- Come here. - Wendy.

333
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.110
Just watch for once.

334
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.480
This is the Demon's flapping.

335
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.980
It's so dusty.

336
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.149
Why is he acting so actively today?

337
00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:52.419
I think he wants to do it differently this week.

338
00:12:52.419 --> 00:12:54.460
I think he can be the Demon.

339
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.490
No, he's not the Demon. He doesn't look like one.

340
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.100
Trust me.

341
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.899
(Vote for me.)

342
00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.000
- Gosh. - I know what you're thinking.

343
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.129
I think I know what you have.

344
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.970
- What? - Key does not have one.

345
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.870
Look at him.

346
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.139
- I went to the restroom together. - Key.

347
00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:12.580
Who received the most votes?

348
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.480
- I won't be able to guess it. - Today,

349
00:13:15.549 --> 00:13:17.350
we have wonderful guests today.

350
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.750
SHINee.

351
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.419
Wanna One, Se Woon, and Red Velvet.

352
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:22.389
We also have GFriend.

353
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:24.889
Vixx is here too. BTOB is doing great too.

354
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:26.860
Min Ho, please say something.

355
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.159
He looked awkward last week as well.

356
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:32.200
He looks so happy.

357
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.700
Min Ho, you should also talk about your group.

358
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.299
- Like... - Winner is doing good too.

359
00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:38.740
- Of course. - You guys are famous.

360
00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.870
Who is this week's winner then?

361
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.570
Who is it?

362
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.169
(Who is the winner?)

363
00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:46.309
Kang Daniel.

364
00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:47.509
(He received the most votes from the viewers.)

365
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:48.809
Great.

366
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:51.009
It's not good that Demon received the most votes.

367
00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:52.879
You are right.

368
00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.149
- I am so jealous. - We are doomed.

369
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.659
Later, my vote will count as two votes.

370
00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:01.120
- Okay. - I feel so pressured.

371
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.759
Then let's ask Daniel...

372
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:07.299
to yield his prize to others.

373
00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:10.169
- That's good. - He's Demon if he doesn't do it.

374
00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:11.570
I think so too.

375
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.240
Look at his smile.

376
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.210
Good. For the first mission, you can use the video call.

377
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.269
(Speedy Video Call)

378
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:20.110
- I'm good at that. - We'll play Video Call Quiz.

379
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.210
Your goal is to answer quickly as many questions...

380
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:24.649
as you can.

381
00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:28.049
One of the players will go to places whether it's a market or cafe.

382
00:14:28.049 --> 00:14:29.990
At those places, there will be questions.

383
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.860
The player will stick the question paper on his or her forehead,

384
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.559
and other players will be able to read the question.

385
00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:37.490
And the remaining five players will help the player to guess the answer.

386
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.600
However, you cannot tell the player what the answer is.

387
00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:42.600
When the player gets it right, the player will return.

388
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.669
When the 1st player returns, the 2nd player will run to a place.

389
00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:46.440
So we'll be able to answer them at around...

390
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.000
Was it 11:30pm?

391
00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:50.210
The 1st game will end at 11:30pm.

392
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.509
Is this the only game we'll be playing today?

393
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:54.580
But the places aren't far from here. We can reach there in five minutes.

394
00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.210
They are nearby. I was just joking.

395
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:57.610
- Let's come up with the order. - What about the length?

396
00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.450
- Who wants to go 1st? - I'll go 1st.

397
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.480
- Seong Wu is first. - Sure.

398
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.519
(While they are choosing the order...)

399
00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:03.120
Su Geun, I'm the Angel. I'm serious.

400
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.159
- I'm telling you the truth. - Then what about me?

401
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:08.320
I find what you guys are doing very adorable.

402
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.299
I get the feeling that Daniel has a Master Key,

403
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.100
but I think he might be the Demon.

404
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.399
I'm about to lose my mind.

405
00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.470
(He's utterly frustrated.)

406
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.399
I'm telling you the truth. Believe me.

407
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.539
Are you serious? Look me in the eyes and tell me.

408
00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:23.710
- When have I been so eager to play? - Look me in the eyes and tell me.

409
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:24.940
- Are you telling me the truth? - Yes.

410
00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:26.240
- Wait. Hold on a second. - I'm serious.

411
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.409
My team isn't focusing on the game.

412
00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:30.210
- They ask who the Demon is. - When have I been so eager to play?

413
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.850
Look at them. What am I going to do?

414
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.649
Hey, you should pay attention to the other team.

415
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.250
I guess my performance last week must have gotten to them,

416
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.090
but why would you make me the Angel again?

417
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.789
I feel anxious now. This is driving me crazy.

418
00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:43.659
Good luck.

419
00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:45.960
Make sure we can see your forehead clearly.

420
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.100
- We have to see it when he goes? - Yes.

421
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.830
- Henry. - There are six destinations.

422
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.470
- The player will pick 1 among 6. - Okay.

423
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.799
- How is he going to find the place? - He has to find it himself?

424
00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:55.840
Are you serious?

425
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.809
- You must find them yourselves. - This sounds hard.

426
00:15:57.809 --> 00:15:59.710
- That's going to be hard. - My sense of direction is terrible.

427
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.509
- Get ready. - Get ready.

428
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.679
Start!

429
00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:05.080
- Seong Wu, be careful. - Hey,

430
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.419
- which one did you pick? - Let's go, Seong Wu.

431
00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:07.950
- I can't see. - He picked one.

432
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.120
- Seong Wu, where are you going? - Sorry?

433
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.690
- Tell us where you're going. - Don't listen to him!

434
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.090
- Hey, just go! - Stay focused!

435
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.860
(Yes! My trick worked!)

436
00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:16.190
- Tell us where you're going. - Don't listen to him!

437
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.429
(Team Su Geun's distraction gives him a late start.)

438
00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:20.759
(I must make up for this.)

439
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.730
- Good for you. - I want to answer the question.

440
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.600
(Seong Wu, the fast runner, goes at it.)

441
00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:25.740
- He's running. - Right.

442
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.899
- I can see him running. - Let's move up a bit.

443
00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.139
Hey, come here. Look at him.

444
00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:30.340
- We must see how this looks. - Go away.

445
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.379
- Can you hear him? - I can't see him well.

446
00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:34.210
(Master Village, car wash, park, restaurant, cafe, convenience store)

447
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.009
(The destination of the 1st player, Seong Wu, is the park.)

448
00:16:38.009 --> 00:16:40.450
(He heads to the park from Master Village.)

449
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.690
(He arrives at the park in a blink of an eye.)

450
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.789
Can you hear me, Seong Wu?

451
00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:45.919
Yes.

452
00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:49.990
- SBS's equipment is the best. - It's amazing.

453
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.759
It's just a video call. It has nothing to do with SBS's equipment.

454
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.330
Where is the sculpture?

455
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.000
- He ran the other way. - Seong Wu.

456
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.799
Go straight all the way to the terminal in Paju.

457
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.210
It's hard to find it.

458
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.710
It's where we filmed the opening segment.

459
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.210
I found it. I got it.

460
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.950
- Seong Wu. - I found it. I got it.

461
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.380
- Put it on your forehead. - He saw the way.

462
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.450
(He puts the question paper on his forehead.)

463
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:13.849
- I have to see this. - Put it on your forehead.

464
00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:16.519
(What does it say on my forehead?)

465
00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:17.589
(I have my own fish to fry.)

466
00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:18.619
- What's that? - All right.

467
00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.019
- You can't get up. - You're not supposed to get up.

468
00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:22.190
- Hyun Moo, come on. - It's a proverb.

469
00:17:22.529 --> 00:17:24.660
- It's easy. It's so easy. - Hey, this is it, Seong Wu.

470
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.859
- Seong Wu. - Yes?

471
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.460
- They are so dumb. - It's a proverb.

472
00:17:27.529 --> 00:17:28.869
- With this... - It's a proverb.

473
00:17:28.869 --> 00:17:30.230
(They must explain it through the video call.)

474
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.299
- Seong Wu. - No, that's not it. No.

475
00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:33.799
- It's a proverb. - No, no.

476
00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:36.839
(However, the phone is in constant movement.)

477
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.509
- It's a proverb? - Yes, it's a proverb!

478
00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:39.710
- A proverb? - Yes.

479
00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.109
- The nose... - "I have my own fish to fry."

480
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.619
(Eun Kwang's gesture plays a decisive role.)

481
00:17:46.349 --> 00:17:47.819
(But unfortunately, the camera moves up.)

482
00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:48.920
I have my own fish to fry!

483
00:17:49.089 --> 00:17:51.819
(He overcomes the hardship and gets the answer.)

484
00:17:51.819 --> 00:17:52.859
(He answers the first question.)

485
00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:55.390
- Come back! Come back here. - My goodness.

486
00:17:55.589 --> 00:17:57.230
All right. Hong Bin, get ready.

487
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.000
- He's running with the paper. - Hey.

488
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.630
- Run! - You can take it off your forehead.

489
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.730
Just hurry back.

490
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.299
He must be in a hurry.

491
00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:06.769
- We can do it with the chair. - We can let go of that.

492
00:18:06.769 --> 00:18:07.970
- Good luck. - Yes!

493
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.170
- Come on. - All right.

494
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.069
- Continue the race. - Hey, start running.

495
00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:12.380
- The time is ticking. - Hong Bin.

496
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.009
- Which one did you pick? - Car wash?

497
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.279
- This one? - Just hurry!

498
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.680
- How am I going to find this place? - No, we can't do that yet.

499
00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.920
Does anyone know where the car wash is?

500
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.950
Do you know where the car wash is?

501
00:18:23.349 --> 00:18:24.720
- I didn't see a car wash here. - Car wash?

502
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.259
That's near Paju Terminal.

503
00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.789
Am I going to the right direction?

504
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:30.829
(Where am I? Who am I?)

505
00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:31.930
All I see is the parking lot.

506
00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:34.829
I found it! I found it!

507
00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:36.829
(Car wash)

508
00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:37.829
He found it!

509
00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:39.599
- He did? - That's great!

510
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.500
(However, he must find the paper in the car wash.)

511
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.509
Yes!

512
00:18:42.869 --> 00:18:44.740
The car wash is too big for him to search.

513
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.839
I'm sure they put it somewhere visible. Hyun Moo, be logical.

514
00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:49.750
(Luckily, he spots the paper on top of the washer.)

515
00:18:50.349 --> 00:18:51.380
Here I go.

516
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:53.220
(Making the answer readable is the key.)

517
00:18:57.349 --> 00:18:58.420
(Rag to riches)

518
00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.690
Hey, you must stay seated.

519
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.059
Come on, guys.

520
00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:03.490
(Eun Kwang, the king of expression, manages to read the answer.)

521
00:19:03.589 --> 00:19:04.829
Hey, we should move.

522
00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:06.599
- Seriously? They have to move? - Goodness.

523
00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:08.029
Wait, that is...

524
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:09.099
It's this.

525
00:19:09.099 --> 00:19:10.599
- Look at this. I don't know. - Look at my fingers.

526
00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:11.599
(No matter how hard they try...)

527
00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:14.900
(They are forced to say goodbye.)

528
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.210
Let's move! Come on, move!

529
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.210
(The camera goes to the opposite side.)

530
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.339
All I see is the floor.

531
00:19:21.309 --> 00:19:22.650
I see nothing, but the floor.

532
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.250
- Really? The camera... - Move up. He can't see your faces.

533
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.680
- Hong Bin, it's a phrase. - Turn the camera around.

534
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.289
(He's trying to express the phrase with his body.)

535
00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:30.349
Face the camera.

536
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.720
- Water? - Go from there!

537
00:19:34.259 --> 00:19:35.930
(This time, he imitates a dragon.)

538
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:37.589
A dinosaur?

539
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.230
You have all the clues now. Put those two clues together.

540
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.630
This is a phrase.

541
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.769
Rags to riches?

542
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.769
(That's correct.)

543
00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:47.970
- Did I get it right? - Come back quickly!

544
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.039
Darn!

545
00:19:49.569 --> 00:19:50.940
- "Darn"? - Hey.

546
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.009
Darn!

547
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.579
- "Darn"? - Hey.

548
00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:57.079
- How could you swear at me? - I get you're frustrated, but...

549
00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:58.509
- Hey! - Do you think that's polite of you?

550
00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:00.720
- He must've been frustrated. - But he shouldn't have said that.

551
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.819
That was so sudden.

552
00:20:01.819 --> 00:20:03.150
- We are at a disadvantage in this. - Won't there be questions...

553
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.519
- other than proverbs? - We have foreigners in our team.

554
00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:05.589
That's true.

555
00:20:05.589 --> 00:20:06.920
- English phrases... - I know a lot of proverbs.

556
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.190
- Did you know this one them? - No,

557
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.059
- you don't know proverbs. - Of course I do. It was water...

558
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.130
- He doesn't know what it means. - He's not Korean.

559
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.700
- Can this game end... - I learned a lot of them.

560
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.730
with Henry playing?

561
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.529
- He's back. - That was fast.

562
00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:19.170
- My goodness, it's my turn. - Why were you so upset?

563
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.940
Hong Bin, their explanation was horrible, wasn't it?

564
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.170
- It's the batting cage. - Hurry.

565
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.009
- Come on. Get going. - That's in Jamsil.

566
00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:29.880
- Jamsil? - She should run there.

567
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.509
Where's the batting cage?

568
00:20:32.349 --> 00:20:33.579
- Is it this way? Or that way? - It wasn't on the left side.

569
00:20:33.579 --> 00:20:34.950
- Is it that way? - You must find it on your own.

570
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.589
You know where you're going, right? Don't just start running.

571
00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:38.660
I turned right because you told me it wasn't on the left side.

572
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.660
(Go straight when you're lost.)

573
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.690
- Hey. - Is she going home?

574
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.720
She's been running for too long.

575
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:43.589
I think she might be going home.

576
00:20:43.589 --> 00:20:46.099
- I can hear the bats batting. - I bet you can't see anything.

577
00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:48.099
How am I going to get there?

578
00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:50.900
Wendy, there must be a better angle for you to show your face.

579
00:20:53.569 --> 00:20:54.640
I found it!

580
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.539
(Batting cage)

581
00:20:56.539 --> 00:20:57.910
- That's good. - Look at that.

582
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.009
- I guess it's far. - The batting cage.

583
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.210
(She bumps her head.)

584
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.980
- Hey. - You can't play baseball.

585
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.650
Fix your hair.

586
00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:08.819
- Let's take turns. - What does that mean?

587
00:21:08.819 --> 00:21:10.349
You can't explain that. Hyun Moo, you should do it.

588
00:21:10.349 --> 00:21:12.660
- No, I know what it means. - Henry.

589
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.859
- Henry, stop. - Come on. Just tell me.

590
00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:14.890
She showed us.

591
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.930
- Tell me first. - Wait.

592
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.130
- Let's move there. Move! - Hyun Moo!

593
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.000
(They are in chaos.)

594
00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:21.460
- Hey! - Henry, hold on.

595
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.500
- Go over there. - Talk to me.

596
00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:25.799
- We should explain it. - This is not good.

597
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:26.799
(The camera moves away.)

598
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.269
- Come back. - I'm right here!

599
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.710
That camera.

600
00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:31.470
- This camera... - The camera is carefree.

601
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.509
- We got it. - Stop it.

602
00:21:32.509 --> 00:21:33.509
What does that mean?

603
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.880
3, 3, 8.

604
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.150
- Wendy. - I don't know any proverbs.

605
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.890
- Wendy. - Hey, baby. Wait, no.

606
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.119
(Eun Kwang comes to rescue again.)

607
00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:46.720
(He's imitating a three-year-old baby.)

608
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.529
- Old habits die hard. - Right, right!

609
00:21:53.359 --> 00:21:54.859
- Great! - How did she answer that?

610
00:21:54.859 --> 00:21:56.700
- I imitated a baby, and she got it. - She did?

611
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.069
- Hey, Eun Kwang is really good. - Good job.

612
00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:02.609
(Is it my turn now?)

613
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.369
Turn right? When I get out, I should turn right?

614
00:22:04.369 --> 00:22:06.539
- You got it. - Yes, that's correct! You're right!

615
00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:07.740
Eun Kwang, that's a good angle.

616
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.480
Are you kidding me?

617
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.809
(He presents the question at the convenience store.)

618
00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:13.079
- What? When I ran quickly... - Show us.

619
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:16.690
- Eun Kwang. - It's food. You do it on purpose.

620
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.059
- Like this. - You do this on purpose.

621
00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:21.160
- Strike a stone with an egg. - There you go!

622
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.259
(That's correct.)

623
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.730
(He answered it right away only with one clue.)

624
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:25.730
- He's amazing! - How did he get this one?

625
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:27.930
It's pitch-dark here. There's no one here.

626
00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:29.630
There it is.

627
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.869
(Restaurant)

628
00:22:30.869 --> 00:22:31.869
He got there quickly.

629
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.799
(Where is the paper with the question?)

630
00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.039
Hello.

631
00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.440
Hey, they sell pillows with buckwheat.

632
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.279
I found it.

633
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:45.819
It didn't take him long to find it.

634
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.049
- Get closer. - You shall reap what you sowed.

635
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:49.450
Hey, come closer.

636
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.390
- Hyun Moo! - You can't see under your nose.

637
00:22:53.259 --> 00:22:55.490
(What did he say?)

638
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:56.990
Hyun Moo, there's no light.

639
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:59.630
- You can't see under your nose. - It's dark in here.

640
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:01.460
What? What does that mean?

641
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.430
- He just said the answer! - What should I say?

642
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.200
- That's the answer. - He said the answer.

643
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.799
- It's what you just thought of. - That's the answer.

644
00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.539
- That's the answer. - Hey, I can't hear you.

645
00:23:09.539 --> 00:23:10.809
- Ankhesenamen. - Hyun Moo.

646
00:23:11.609 --> 00:23:12.710
- Ankhesenamen. - Hyun Moo.

647
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.109
- Ankhesenamen. - No, that's not it.

648
00:23:15.009 --> 00:23:16.279
(That was a nice move.)

649
00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:17.309
Ankhesenamen.

650
00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:19.450
(You can't see what's right under your nose.)

651
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.380
- So we are in... - What do you mean?

652
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.589
You must look at it closely.

653
00:23:22.589 --> 00:23:23.789
- It's not bright. - It looks like this.

654
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:25.390
- On the bottom... - It's dark.

655
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.960
You can't see what's right under your nose!

656
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.930
(He manages to figure it out after many complications.)

657
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:32.730
I gave him the answer. I guess he didn't hear me.

658
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.230
But how did he hear when I said Ankhesenamen?

659
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.069
(Way to go, Su Geun!)

660
00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:37.529
- I didn't make sense at all. - Right.

661
00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:39.470
- Hey. - Okay, okay.

662
00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.069
Only one person should talk.

663
00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:43.009
- Only one of you should talk. - It's my turn.

664
00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:44.309
- Where are you going? - To the cafe.

665
00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:45.710
- I've been there. - The name is on the card.

666
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.579
- That's the cafe. - Everyone.

667
00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:48.950
- It's at the end of the road. - All I heard was Ankhesenamen.

668
00:23:49.349 --> 00:23:50.750
- I couldn't hear anything. - Go straight?

669
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.380
- Hold on a second. - Keep going.

670
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.220
- Can you see me? - We can see you very well.

671
00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.349
- Can you see my nostrils? - You don't have to show them.

672
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.519
- You don't have time for that. - We don't need to see them.

673
00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:03.490
- You don't have time for that. - We don't need to see them.

674
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.529
Don't show us your nostrils.

675
00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.460
(They had no idea that he was just getting started.)

676
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.529
Keep going.

677
00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:08.630
Keep going.

678
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.900
When are we going to play the game?

679
00:24:12.599 --> 00:24:15.240
Since we're on that, let me say. I'm the Angel.

680
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.039
- Please believe me. - What's wrong with him?

681
00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:20.009
- Are we still on that? - I'm serious.

682
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.740
He kept saying he's the Angel.

683
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.450
- He's not focusing on the game. - I need to repeat myself.

684
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:25.349
- I'll tell you this until the end. - I heard this about 50 times.

685
00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:27.349
I'm telling you the truth.

686
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.420
- I think I might be brainwashed. - When we play the game,

687
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.690
everyone should vote for me.

688
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:33.990
Vote for me.

689
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.829
This is a cafe! It's the cafe!

690
00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:39.430
- It's the one. I found it. - You need to go in.

691
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.630
What does it look like?

692
00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:42.170
It looks like this.

693
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.900
- I can't find it. - Look. It's right here.

694
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.670
- Henry. Henry, look at the camera. - What?

695
00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:50.140
Look at the camera. It looks like this. There's a sticker on the back.

696
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.569
- Hurry. - I know.

697
00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:53.809
- Hey, hurry. - Don't fight now.

698
00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:55.210
- Don't fight. - Hey.

699
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.410
You're not there to video call us.

700
00:24:58.009 --> 00:25:00.119
- Come on. Find it. - I found it.

701
00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.490
- Put it on your forehead. - Stick it on your forehead.

702
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.589
(He still moves slowly.)

703
00:25:04.589 --> 00:25:05.789
Come on. Hurry.

704
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.490
- I see. - Rice cake.

705
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.990
- This is easy. - You lie down.

706
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.759
- Lie down. - Someone is passed out!

707
00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:18.470
- Someone is passed out. - Okay.

708
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.039
- Someone is passed out. - What's "lie down" in Korean?

709
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.740
- They're explaining it thoroughly. - I'm eating rice cake.

710
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.680
- You should've said, "rice cake". - It's a piece...

711
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.609
- Continue. - It's a piece of gimbap.

712
00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:29.750
- No, no. - That's not it.

713
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.150
(No, that's not correct.)

714
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.779
- It's rice cake! - What did he say?

715
00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:36.349
No, no, no!

716
00:25:36.349 --> 00:25:38.519
- It's chewier than gimbap. - It's a piece of fried rice?

717
00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:40.319
- Rice cake! - Rice cake!

718
00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:42.829
Rice cake? I know rice cake. "Rice cake"!

719
00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:45.430
It's a piece of cake!

720
00:25:46.329 --> 00:25:47.900
- Did I get it right? - We'll let this count.

721
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.130
- We'll count that. - Come back. Henry, come back.

722
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.500
That was right? This is amazing.

723
00:25:54.569 --> 00:25:57.670
My goodness. See? I told you that I could do this.

724
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.039
- I'm impressed Henry got it right. - He said, "gimbap"?

725
00:26:00.579 --> 00:26:01.640
- He even said, "fried rice". - I told you that I could do this.

726
00:26:01.809 --> 00:26:03.549
- Gimbap and fried rice? - Good job.

727
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.250
Hyun Moo, don't you look down on me.

728
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.450
- You saw that, right? - Put it over there.

729
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.289
- He was the only one without it. - That's how he knew.

730
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.190
- Henry, good work. - Good job.

731
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.430
- Henry, you did well. - Good job.

732
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.529
- Hyun Moo, I told you I knew it. - Well done.

733
00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.599
- 1, 2. - You guys are in trouble.

734
00:26:20.599 --> 00:26:22.099
Everyone has to move at the same time.

735
00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:24.400
Actually, we don't even have to run given their record.

736
00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:26.539
- Get ready. - Go for it!

737
00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:27.970
- Let's go! - Start!

738
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.769
- Start. - It's the convenience store.

739
00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:31.269
- Convenience store? - I have to turn right, don't I?

740
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:33.009
- Turn right, and go straight. - Are those the same places?

741
00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.650
- They'll go to the same ones. - We're good at moving.

742
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.279
- Going second is better. - Our teamwork is great.

743
00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.579
- If that's the case... - Look at this.

744
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.150
We already spent 30 minutes with this game.

745
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.819
- He keeps going straight. - Look at him.

746
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.960
- You've been walking for long. - Hey, I'm fine.

747
00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:47.859
I'm okay.

748
00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:50.829
My mom couldn't get the right angle just like Su Geun.

749
00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:55.730
Parents usually have their cameras on the bottom.

750
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.869
- They look down at their cameras. - Right.

751
00:26:59.869 --> 00:27:01.869
"End of the Earth". I see it here.

752
00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:03.710
"Live Karaoke".

753
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.079
- He's telling us what he sees. - "Pub".

754
00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:09.779
I was just looking at stuff. Excuse me.

755
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.250
There are a lot of customers here. Excuse me.

756
00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.849
- He arrived. - I'm at the store now.

757
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.690
- Hey, I found it! - My goodness.

758
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.319
- I found it. - He got an easy one.

759
00:27:19.319 --> 00:27:21.720
- This is where the question was. - Seriously?

760
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.259
- That's an easy place to find it. - Get closer. Hey, get closer.

761
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.259
- He can't touch it. - Please move the camera.

762
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.769
- Gosh, this one is... - Su Geun.

763
00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:32.099
- Hey, move this way. One... - They're moving.

764
00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:34.400
- Ankhesenamen! - That's an easy one.

765
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.539
It's not the sky.

766
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.369
This one is easy.

767
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.279
- It's not the sky. It's... - I can't see.

768
00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:42.650
- What's the opposite of the sky? - Ground!

769
00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:45.279
- Once you vote for someone... - With that...

770
00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:47.380
- Use that word. - Ground.

771
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.619
- Swimming while touching ground. - Yes. Come back now.

772
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:52.289
- Cotton candy! - You can come back now.

773
00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:54.190
- Hurry back! Come back. - Su Geun.

774
00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:56.130
- Su Geun, run! - I think we won, but run though.

775
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.660
- Please run. - He's taking his time.

776
00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.700
Hello.

777
00:27:59.799 --> 00:28:01.630
(He's interacting with people.)

778
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.069
- Look at him taking his time. - Why is he saying hello to them?

779
00:28:03.069 --> 00:28:05.069
- Guys. - Yes?

780
00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:07.670
- Let me use the bathroom. - No!

781
00:28:07.869 --> 00:28:10.740
- Come back and go to the restroom. - No, Su Geun. I'm begging you.

782
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.339
Hey, the convenience store is too far. Tell me where you are.

783
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.210
- You have to show them. - Show your forehead.

784
00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.549
- Take it. - Let me see.

785
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:18.619
- He's about to pass out. - Park?

786
00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:21.150
- That way! Go out. On the left, - Park?

787
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.390
there's... Hey, listen to me before you go!

788
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.190
(Key, the fast runner, dashes to the park at full speed.)

789
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.430
It's too dark.

790
00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:33.799
- Where is he? - He arrived.

791
00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:36.470
- That's the place. That's the park. - The angle is different now.

792
00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:38.230
- He's fast. - How was my angle?

793
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.670
We only saw your chin.

794
00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:42.410
The sculpture?

795
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:45.740
I'm about to lose my mind.

796
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.210
(Screaming)

797
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.049
(Eureka!)

798
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.279
- Come closer. - Move the camera closer.

799
00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:56.589
- That's too close now. - I can't see.

800
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.859
- This is food. - It's food.

801
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.720
You know when other people's portion is larger than yours.

802
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.730
- Can we speak in English too? - Hey.

803
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.799
(With the explanation that gave too many things away...)

804
00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:07.930
- Can we speak in English too? - Grass is greener on another side.

805
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.099
That's correct!

806
00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:11.099
Did I get it right? Was that correct?

807
00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:13.769
Hey, wait. You almost told him the answer.

808
00:29:13.769 --> 00:29:15.269
- What a jerk. - He gave away too many.

809
00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:16.869
Hyun Moo said you're a jerk.

810
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.440
You gave him the answer.

811
00:29:19.809 --> 00:29:20.910
Su Geun.

812
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.410
Can I use the restroom?

813
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.880
It's strange, but don't you want to use the restroom?

814
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.279
He's faster than Su Geun.

815
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:29.619
- That was fast. - He was so quick.

816
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.490
Hurry, hurry. Get up!

817
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.720
- Take the camera. Show us the card. - It's the cafe.

818
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.460
- Cafe? - That was cute.

819
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.529
The cafe is...

820
00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:39.130
Hey, the air is very fresh.

821
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.970
You don't have time to enjoy the air.

822
00:29:42.329 --> 00:29:43.599
I found it!

823
00:29:44.369 --> 00:29:45.640
I found the cafe. I found it.

824
00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:47.599
- He's fast. - Go inside.

825
00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:48.809
After you do that...

826
00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:49.940
(He finds the spot.)

827
00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.769
- Go inside. Keep going in. - Hello.

828
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:53.779
- Keep going in. Show us that. - Wait. Isn't that it?

829
00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:56.480
- Where? - Was it on the chair?

830
00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.450
The chair? I got it!

831
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.779
- Why isn't he showing us the card? - I can't see.

832
00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:02.319
- Move closer to the camera. - I can't read that.

833
00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:04.190
- Move closer! - What is that?

834
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.490
Hey, that's...

835
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.829
- Hey, let's move. - Look here!

836
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.430
- Look at us! - Come here. Come this way.

837
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.559
- Look at this. Right here. - Se Woon!

838
00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:14.960
- What shape is this? - Hey, look!

839
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.769
- Out of a frying pan into a fire! - That's too fast.

840
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.940
Before you go to the mountain, you do something.

841
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.539
- What do you do before you hike? - You should use the restroom.

842
00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:23.440
- How can you eat in the mountain? - Hey, look at me.

843
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.009
- Wait, Se Woon. - I'm eating here!

844
00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:26.410
A loaf of bread is better than the song of many birds.

845
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.410
That's it!

846
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.509
He's smart. Your distractions won't work.

847
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:32.250
(Stop disrupting us and go away.)

848
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.380
He did well.

849
00:30:35.349 --> 00:30:36.650
- You look lonely. - Whoever is next, get ready.

850
00:30:37.049 --> 00:30:39.059
- You look lonely. - Whoever is next, get ready.

851
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.789
I'm almost there.

852
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.730
- That was good. - Easy ones came up first.

853
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.190
- Where are you headed? - To the restaurant.

854
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:45.930
- It's on the left. - Where is that?

855
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.299
- Which way are you going? - He has to turn left.

856
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.599
- I have to turn left? Left? - Wait a second.

857
00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:52.269
You have to turn right! It's on the right side!

858
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.200
- Turn right! - The noodle restaurant...

859
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.640
- Turn left! - I was there. Look at the sign.

860
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.970
It says, "Noodle Restaurant".

861
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.279
Noodles, grilled spicy chicken... That's my brother's restaurant.

862
00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:04.779
(How nice of him. He promotes the restaurant and attracts customers.)

863
00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:06.849
Just say you've been to the restaurant.

864
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.450
Hello.

865
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.490
- Hi. - Welcome.

866
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.420
- Where is it? - Have I been there?

867
00:31:12.089 --> 00:31:13.490
- Check the table. - The owner must've put it away.

868
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.190
He probably put it away. The restaurant was closing down.

869
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.000
- Did you find it? Did you? - Stay for a while and come back.

870
00:31:23.069 --> 00:31:24.569
- What is that? - It's on his forehead.

871
00:31:24.569 --> 00:31:26.069
(Someone is always one step ahead of you.)

872
00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:27.839
- Look at Su Geun. - I know this one.

873
00:31:27.839 --> 00:31:30.109
- This is too easy. - Look at me.

874
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:33.109
(Su Geun swiftly uses his body to describe the saying.)

875
00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:36.579
- That was cheating. - No one barely noticed I was up.

876
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.349
Someone is always one step ahead of you?

877
00:31:39.349 --> 00:31:41.150
(Daniel answers it correctly.)

878
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.220
You should let us count that.

879
00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.519
- Come on. You should play it fair. - I thought I was on the floor.

880
00:31:45.619 --> 00:31:47.819
I'm sorry. I got up because I got too excited.

881
00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:49.660
We'll add 10 seconds to our record.

882
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.230
- I understand that wasn't fair. - Add 20 seconds.

883
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:53.799
That was quick.

884
00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:55.569
- That was great. - You came back quickly.

885
00:31:55.569 --> 00:31:57.170
- Good job. - The batting cage?

886
00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.569
- Turn left! - Wendy went there. Turn left.

887
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.470
Who's next? Min Ho. Turn left, and run to the car wash.

888
00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:05.279
- The next place is car wash? - You can go to the car wash...

889
00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.609
and take a shower there if you want.

890
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.480
Can I go and shower?

891
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.680
- I'm about to lose it. - Gosh, I'm tired.

892
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.950
Did you find it?

893
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.049
(Batting cage)

894
00:32:13.049 --> 00:32:14.880
- Is that it? - She found it. She got it.

895
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.920
Nice!

896
00:32:16.089 --> 00:32:18.119
- Already? - You're doing well, Ye Rin.

897
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.089
- What is this? - She's already there?

898
00:32:20.089 --> 00:32:21.119
She turned right.

899
00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:22.960
- Calm down. Take your time. - I can't open the cage.

900
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.200
- Don't rush. - It's stuck on the bat.

901
00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:29.230
- She's already there? - She got it. She found it.

902
00:32:29.529 --> 00:32:32.500
- It's the food that came up before. - That's great.

903
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.470
- It's a piece of cake? - That's similar.

904
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:38.779
That's similar. This is inside something.

905
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.079
- What's that? - Someone's calling.

906
00:32:41.579 --> 00:32:43.509
- It's inside... What's that? - Someone's calling.

907
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:45.279
- Her senior colleague is calling. - What just happened?

908
00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:47.519
- No way. - We were doing so well.

909
00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:49.049
- You can't get up! - Ye Rin!

910
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.819
The call is disconnected.

911
00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:53.890
They hung up.

912
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:57.259
(She's puzzled.)

913
00:32:57.259 --> 00:32:58.829
- I got a call. - Did your battery run out?

914
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.730
- It's because you played dirty. - Who is Yoon Jong Woo?

915
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.130
- Video call her. - I got it. Ye Rin!

916
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:06.440
- We're losing time. - No, no. I have her on the phone.

917
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.470
- Let's hurry. Time is ticking. - Ye Rin.

918
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.539
- You should have a do-over. - Wait.

919
00:33:10.539 --> 00:33:13.640
This thing is inside something.

920
00:33:13.779 --> 00:33:15.480
Pie in the sky!

921
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.250
That's right. Did you see that?

922
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.450
Stay calm. See? She answered it.

923
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.650
- Everyone. - They're good.

924
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:21.750
Hurry back.

925
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.519
- She's fast. - All right. Get ready.

926
00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:26.690
- Get the phone. - Okay.

927
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.730
I'm sure Min Ho understands his task. It's the car wash, isn't it?

928
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.890
- It's sort of isolated. - Where is the car wash?

929
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.900
I don't see it.

930
00:33:34.059 --> 00:33:36.170
- It's right here. - See? I told you.

931
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.069
Having a good memory is important.

932
00:33:38.069 --> 00:33:39.140
(Strolling around)

933
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.299
Min Ho, run.

934
00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:41.900
(Look cool some other time.)

935
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.609
Min Ho, it looks like you're not doing your best. Don't walk.

936
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.880
I'm at the car wash.

937
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.579
- I know that. - "I know that."

938
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.549
- There's nothing here. - It might be inside a machine.

939
00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:54.250
- I found it. - He got it.

940
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.589
- Put it on your forehead. Be calm. - Put in a 50-cent coin.

941
00:33:57.589 --> 00:33:59.789
- Stop talking. Hey, Min Ho. - That's a waste.

942
00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:01.160
What is this that I'm wearing? Look.

943
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.230
- That's an easy one. - I can't see!

944
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.500
- I can't see you. Move. - What is this?

945
00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:07.500
- What is this? - Angel.

946
00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:09.930
What are we wearing now?

947
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.039
- What are we wearing now? - Fine feathers make fine birds.

948
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.639
Fine feathers make fine birds.

949
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.639
(That's the answer.)

950
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.309
- Run back! - Run!

951
00:34:17.309 --> 00:34:18.880
(He's excited.)

952
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.239
Put your arms around each other.

953
00:34:20.539 --> 00:34:24.010
(Team Su Geun is getting far ahead.)

954
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.579
(They cheer for him through the phone.)

955
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.019
That was great.

956
00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:31.090
- Min Ho, you're late. - It's 58.

957
00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.789
(Keep moving.)

958
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.960
Is the time limited?

959
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.860
Min Ho, put it on here.

960
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.329
Put it on here.

961
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:41.130
Over here. Put that over here.

962
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.769
(He tries to cheat.)

963
00:34:43.769 --> 00:34:45.800
Go and sit down.

964
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.369
My goodness.

965
00:34:47.369 --> 00:34:49.940
- We'll accept that. - It was fun.

966
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:55.039
(Time record for Team Hyun Moo and Team Su Geun)

967
00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:57.309
- Good job. - It's okay.

968
00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.050
You did a good job,

969
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:00.920
but the team to start has a disadvantage.

970
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.389
The second team can observe first.

971
00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:05.889
As Angels, let's finish it on a friendly note.

972
00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:07.420
Okay.

973
00:35:08.889 --> 00:35:09.929
Let's go.

974
00:35:09.929 --> 00:35:11.690
Tell us what the Key Guides are.

975
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:12.900
Can you read out loud?

976
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.760
Six players of the winning team...

977
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.730
choose one player each...

978
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.670
out of 12 players.

979
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.500
Only you can find out if the player of your choice...

980
00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:23.739
has the Master Key or not.

981
00:35:23.739 --> 00:35:25.110
Let's pick this one.

982
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.039
It's nice and simple. We don't need to worry.

983
00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:28.579
We did that last week.

984
00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:30.280
It could take 14 minutes.

985
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.349
I'm going to find out about you.

986
00:35:33.519 --> 00:35:35.719
I'm going to choose you.

987
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:37.949
- Who will go? - Take a cell phone each.

988
00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:41.690
- Take the one with your name on it. - Do we find out individually?

989
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.230
Only you can find out.

990
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.829
Are you allowed to film this?

991
00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:48.059
- Is it okay? - Yes.

992
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:50.829
- Seriously. - They must feel betrayed.

993
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:54.269
I bet Demon is either Daniel or Su Geun.

994
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.269
I'll send the text now.

995
00:35:57.539 --> 00:35:59.309
I'm completely sure.

996
00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:03.949
(Does Daniel have the Master Key? Does Key have the Master Key?)

997
00:36:05.179 --> 00:36:08.619
Most of you should suspect Daniel.

998
00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:10.690
(Does Daniel have the Master Key?)

999
00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:12.389
Eun Kwang.

1000
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.889
(Does Daniel have the Master Key?)

1001
00:36:14.889 --> 00:36:16.289
Eun Kwang.

1002
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.000
(Does Key have the Master Key?)

1003
00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:23.929
We can only know if they have the Master Key,

1004
00:36:23.929 --> 00:36:25.000
not if they're Angel or Demon.

1005
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.199
That's right.

1006
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.500
We'll send you the answer.

1007
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.369
- Here it is. - It arrived.

1008
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.869
I'm worried that others will see.

1009
00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:33.880
- What should I do? - Seriously.

1010
00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.409
My goodness.

1011
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.210
Unbelievable.

1012
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.380
(Key's key is...)

1013
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:42.789
(They find out who is hiding behind the shadow.)

1014
00:36:42.789 --> 00:36:46.059
(Key's key is...)

1015
00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:50.030
(Do they have the Master Key?)

1016
00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:51.530
Did you find out?

1017
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.559
Yes.

1018
00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:54.699
(Some people are shocked.)

1019
00:36:54.699 --> 00:36:57.230
I misspelled the name.

1020
00:36:58.199 --> 00:36:59.699
(You have a new message.)

1021
00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:02.469
- This is unbelievable. - Check the message.

1022
00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:11.010
(What did those who asked about Daniel find out?)

1023
00:37:12.679 --> 00:37:13.949
I will.

1024
00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.889
(Daniel has the Master Key.)

1025
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.360
(Daniel is either Angel or Demon.)

1026
00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:29.030
(This is when he finds out about his key.)

1027
00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:34.539
(This key is the Master Key.)

1028
00:37:35.739 --> 00:37:41.710
(He pretends not to be flustered.)

1029
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:46.480
(Then he shows to everyone that he's Angel.)

1030
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.920
(As they search for each other's identity,)

1031
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.619
(he keeps persuading others that he's Angel.)

1032
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.019
(Hello, I'm Angel.)

1033
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.030
(Is he Angel who wants to share the prize?)

1034
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:05.369
(Or is he Demon trying to keep the prize to himself?)

1035
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.840
(Only Daniel knows the whole truth.)

1036
00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:15.679
Let's be honest about whom we searched.

1037
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.210
I can't make any promises with you.

1038
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.219
(You aren't trustworthy.)

1039
00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:22.789
- I'm tired of this. - I promised to be good to you.

1040
00:38:22.789 --> 00:38:24.550
Did everyone find out?

1041
00:38:24.619 --> 00:38:27.420
Don't talk about it anymore, okay?

1042
00:38:27.519 --> 00:38:30.260
Daniel, I told you to stop smiling.

1043
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:33.360
People can be shocking.

1044
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.099
(The three found out Daniel has the Master Key.)

1045
00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:36.469
Why do you look surprised?

1046
00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:37.500
I'm shocked.

1047
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.400
It was easy yet hard.

1048
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.940
- You should eat something. - It's easy yet hard.

1049
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.139
- Let's play the next game. - Let's do it.

1050
00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:45.840
- Let's go. - It was shocking.

1051
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.179
SHINee used to be my favorite group.

1052
00:38:49.179 --> 00:38:50.750
- It was my favorite. - Really?

1053
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.880
This dance made me dream of being a singer.

1054
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.619
It's really scary.

1055
00:38:54.619 --> 00:38:55.750
(What is his real intention?)

1056
00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:59.860
Wearing an Angel mask

1057
00:38:59.889 --> 00:39:01.519
Did you see Demon?

1058
00:39:01.519 --> 00:39:04.230
Gosh, this is so unfair.

1059
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.230
I can't trust anyone.

1060
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.630
(Anyone can be lying.)

1061
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.900
- Who did you choose? - What?

1062
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.170
Daniel.

1063
00:39:10.269 --> 00:39:11.400
- What did it say? - What?

1064
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.340
He has the Master Key.

1065
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.900
Daniel does?

1066
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.469
Does he really have it?

1067
00:39:17.409 --> 00:39:19.010
- What about you? - I'm serious.

1068
00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:20.940
I'm Angel.

1069
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.280
- That's why I said... - It's confusing.

1070
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.949
- Gosh. - It's too confusing.

1071
00:39:24.949 --> 00:39:27.480
I said Demon is either Daniel or Su Geun.

1072
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.119
- It's confusing. - I don't think...

1073
00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:32.019
Su Geun can be Angel.

1074
00:39:32.019 --> 00:39:34.260
- It's not Su Geun. - It's not him.

1075
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.260
That's why I asked about Daniel, and he has the Master Key.

1076
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.599
(Daniel has the Master Key.)

1077
00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:40.400
- You seem real. - Wait a minute.

1078
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.500
Shouldn't we discuss?

1079
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.630
We should discuss.

1080
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.699
Seriously.

1081
00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:46.900
Gosh, this is so unfair.

1082
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.869
I have been...

1083
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.739
waiting for this moment.

1084
00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:54.639
- Why? - This is...

1085
00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:57.409
the moment that I can be most convincing.

1086
00:39:57.409 --> 00:39:59.219
I couldn't convince you before.

1087
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.019
The other team is a mess.

1088
00:40:03.019 --> 00:40:05.360
- I think... - There are only Demons.

1089
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.559
There are only Demons.

1090
00:40:06.559 --> 00:40:08.219
I'm Angel.

1091
00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:09.429
(I'm Angel.)

1092
00:40:09.429 --> 00:40:12.500
(What did you say?)

1093
00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:14.030
- You're Angel? - Right.

1094
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.699
- Who's Demon? - It's Daniel.

1095
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.599
- Daniel? - Daniel is Demon.

1096
00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:20.969
(Daniel has the Master Key. Is Daniel the Demon?)

1097
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.510
Why is it him?

1098
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.610
I know it's him...

1099
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.440
because I've lived with him.

1100
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.679
I'm familiar with his facial expressions,

1101
00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:30.610
behavior, and the way he talks.

1102
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.920
I notice when he behaves differently.

1103
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.420
He came to me in private.

1104
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.289
The tone of his voice when he told me the truth...

1105
00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:38.860
was similar to his usual voice.

1106
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.360
- He could be Angel. - No.

1107
00:40:41.929 --> 00:40:43.329
- He's Demon. - He has the Master Key.

1108
00:40:43.329 --> 00:40:45.699
- Master Key. - He definitely has it.

1109
00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:47.099
He said that he isn't.

1110
00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:49.000
I'm sorry, but do you understand the rules?

1111
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.630
- Do you? - Yes.

1112
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:51.829
I think it's him.

1113
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:53.869
- That's not important. - I can see it on his face.

1114
00:40:53.869 --> 00:40:56.139
What's the point of guessing...

1115
00:40:56.139 --> 00:40:57.570
when I'm Angel?

1116
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.840
- You can stop. - Are you Angel?

1117
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.150
- I can't trust you at all. - It's too late.

1118
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.449
- You're so slow. - You said it too late.

1119
00:41:04.449 --> 00:41:07.050
I just understood. I should have pretended better.

1120
00:41:09.789 --> 00:41:11.050
What are you doing?

1121
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.360
I'm drinking coffee.

1122
00:41:12.889 --> 00:41:14.289
Demon's coffee?

1123
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:16.989
(Between us...)

1124
00:41:16.989 --> 00:41:18.630
I won't say anymore.

1125
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.159
I won't say it again to our team members.

1126
00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:22.429
You know that I believe you, right?

1127
00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:25.199
During the shoot last week, Su Geun said from the start...

1128
00:41:25.199 --> 00:41:27.070
that he was Angel.

1129
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.440
No one believed him.

1130
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.110
Now I'm doing the same.

1131
00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:33.179
I kept saying that I'm Angel from the start.

1132
00:41:33.179 --> 00:41:35.139
I did this from the start.

1133
00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:37.050
People thought that I was exaggerating.

1134
00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:39.679
No matter how much I say it,

1135
00:41:39.849 --> 00:41:41.679
people may not believe me.

1136
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.889
Right.

1137
00:41:44.289 --> 00:41:46.460
Do you think that you're friendly?

1138
00:41:46.719 --> 00:41:48.960
I told you that I'm Angel.

1139
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.760
No one will guess.

1140
00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:54.030
What are you telling him?

1141
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.429
- I didn't say anything. - Goodness.

1142
00:41:56.429 --> 00:41:58.300
I didn't say anything important.

1143
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.199
The probability is 50 percent.

1144
00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:01.739
- Whom did you choose? - What?

1145
00:42:01.739 --> 00:42:02.769
Whom did you choose?

1146
00:42:03.269 --> 00:42:04.769
I chose you too.

1147
00:42:04.769 --> 00:42:07.079
- It's either you or Su Geun. - The truth is out.

1148
00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:08.110
Everyone knows.

1149
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.150
Are you Demon?

1150
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.480
One of them is the Demon.

1151
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.920
This can't be.

1152
00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:15.590
I'd be shocked if you're acting.

1153
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.019
I'm not acting.

1154
00:42:17.019 --> 00:42:18.489
Didn't you see me last week?

1155
00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:20.789
I can't keep a poker face.

1156
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.389
- Really? - At that time...

1157
00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:24.860
- I can't do it either. - when we were changing...

1158
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.900
- You're good at it. - No, I'm not.

1159
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.769
- I knew that he wasn't Angel. - I'm not.

1160
00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:30.500
- That's why. - I can't lie.

1161
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.699
Last week...

1162
00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:34.239
It's because you weren't Angel.

1163
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.170
I have no idea.

1164
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.070
I can't believe...

1165
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.039
- that you suspect me. - No.

1166
00:42:40.039 --> 00:42:42.280
I'm utterly speechless.

1167
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.079
It's an intense psychological warfare.

1168
00:42:45.679 --> 00:42:49.050
(Investigation Mission 2)

1169
00:42:49.789 --> 00:42:52.059
- Here's Round 2. - This is Round 2.

1170
00:42:52.659 --> 00:42:54.690
It's Locker Bingo.

1171
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.989
If you win the game...

1172
00:42:56.989 --> 00:42:58.829
inside the locker,

1173
00:42:58.829 --> 00:43:00.460
you gain that locker.

1174
00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.099
We play Bingo with the lockers.

1175
00:43:03.429 --> 00:43:06.000
The idea for this game is impressive.

1176
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.869
As you may already know,

1177
00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:09.909
the most important number is 13.

1178
00:43:09.909 --> 00:43:10.909
It's the center.

1179
00:43:10.909 --> 00:43:12.409
It can be part of any row.

1180
00:43:12.409 --> 00:43:13.840
We must win this first.

1181
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.110
If you win this...

1182
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:16.409
That's my strategy.

1183
00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:17.949
May I open Locker Number 13?

1184
00:43:17.949 --> 00:43:19.219
Go ahead.

1185
00:43:19.219 --> 00:43:20.519
(What kind of game is inside?)

1186
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:22.889
Open it.

1187
00:43:22.889 --> 00:43:24.619
(It's a mysterious red tile.)

1188
00:43:25.289 --> 00:43:26.360
What is it?

1189
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.519
(What's that?)

1190
00:43:27.519 --> 00:43:28.929
- What is it? - Is it chocolate?

1191
00:43:28.929 --> 00:43:29.960
Run On Your Back.

1192
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.059
Crawl on your back.

1193
00:43:32.059 --> 00:43:33.730
The person to finish first wins.

1194
00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:34.760
- What? - Backwards?

1195
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.400
- I'm good at this. - He's good.

1196
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.099
He's good at it.

1197
00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:39.769
I was a B-boy.

1198
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.940
- He was a B-boy. - B-boy.

1199
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.940
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 2, 3, 4.

1200
00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:46.710
(It's passionate B-boy dance.)

1201
00:43:47.179 --> 00:43:50.280
(They're excited to watch him dance but...)

1202
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.219
How does that relate to the back?

1203
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.250
That's true.

1204
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.690
It's related.

1205
00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.019
Is there any B-boy?

1206
00:43:57.019 --> 00:43:58.420
I'm home often.

1207
00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.989
I'm usually on the floor.

1208
00:43:59.989 --> 00:44:00.989
While lying down?

1209
00:44:00.989 --> 00:44:03.190
Do you move on your back?

1210
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.530
Are you confident?

1211
00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:06.360
(It's hard to believe him.)

1212
00:44:06.659 --> 00:44:07.860
- If you win, - Do we start on the back?

1213
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.099
I'll believe that you're Angel.

1214
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.570
Do your best.

1215
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.639
- I'll play. - If he's Angel, he'll want to tell.

1216
00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:14.969
He'll try to win.

1217
00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:18.010
We have to win Locker Number 13.

1218
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.139
- Seriously. - It's the best one.

1219
00:44:20.139 --> 00:44:21.949
- Does it depend on it? - You must do well.

1220
00:44:21.949 --> 00:44:23.110
(I'll show you my strength.)

1221
00:44:23.449 --> 00:44:24.880
- You can do it. - Let's go.

1222
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:26.679
(The competition will be fierce.)

1223
00:44:26.679 --> 00:44:27.949
- Let's go. - Go.

1224
00:44:27.949 --> 00:44:30.289
Don't go out to the cement.

1225
00:44:30.519 --> 00:44:31.820
(What?)

1226
00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:32.889
That's right.

1227
00:44:32.889 --> 00:44:34.090
Is it possible to go straight?

1228
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.260
- You can take a look. - Disturb him.

1229
00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.199
You can stop each other. Are you ready?

1230
00:44:39.699 --> 00:44:41.630
It's a B-boy versus a couch potato.

1231
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:42.699
(B-boy versus couch potato)

1232
00:44:42.699 --> 00:44:44.400
Start when I say go.

1233
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.840
Get ready, set, go.

1234
00:44:48.369 --> 00:44:49.369
That's good.

1235
00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:50.440
(The game starts.)

1236
00:44:50.639 --> 00:44:51.670
Go.

1237
00:44:51.769 --> 00:44:52.780
That's good.

1238
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.309
(It's a close match.)

1239
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:56.610
(Are they really running?)

1240
00:44:56.849 --> 00:44:58.650
(Daniel is impressive...)

1241
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.050
(as he was a B-boy.)

1242
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.650
(I'm Angel.)

1243
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.460
(I won't...)

1244
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.920
(let you win.)

1245
00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:11.030
(He suddenly accelerates.)

1246
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:12.860
(This is great.)

1247
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:18.530
(The winner of the close match)

1248
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.940
(It's Daniel.)

1249
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.340
They were running.

1250
00:45:23.739 --> 00:45:25.110
(He proves himself as Angel.)

1251
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.280
Weren't they practically running?

1252
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.849
(Some are excited and some are disappointed.)

1253
00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:32.179
- That was amazing. - They were so fast.

1254
00:45:32.179 --> 00:45:33.179
(He shows the best.)

1255
00:45:33.179 --> 00:45:34.250
Where are you going?

1256
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.949
- That was impressive. - By the way,

1257
00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:38.489
Daniel was faster than me walking.

1258
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.519
- How did they bounce like that? - I know.

1259
00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.789
- Our team wins Locker Number 13. - That was so close.

1260
00:45:44.789 --> 00:45:45.960
(Team Su Geun wins Locker Number 13.)

1261
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.329
Can we mark it?

1262
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:49.429
- Put it on. - I'm putting it on.

1263
00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:51.969
(Team Su Geun gets a locker with the most advantage.)

1264
00:45:51.969 --> 00:45:53.739
- Let's block them. - We'll go this way.

1265
00:45:53.739 --> 00:45:55.239
- We'll block them. - We'll go this way.

1266
00:45:55.239 --> 00:45:57.139
(Daniel is excited.)

1267
00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.710
- That was amazing. You're Angel. - Thank you.

1268
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.949
Daniel, I temporarily accept that you're Angel.

1269
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.320
- You can't do that. - You're Angel at this moment.

1270
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.119
- Wait a minute. - Only this moment?

1271
00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:12.559
What's wrong with you?

1272
00:46:12.559 --> 00:46:14.219
- Choose the next one. - Okay.

1273
00:46:14.219 --> 00:46:16.489
- Shall we go this way? - Seven?

1274
00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:17.989
- It's the lucky number. - You wanted it.

1275
00:46:17.989 --> 00:46:19.460
- Seven. - Let's do that.

1276
00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.630
- Why are you giving us a look? - We'll choose seven.

1277
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.199
- Number seven. - Is this it?

1278
00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:23.300
- Look. - What is it?

1279
00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:26.170
It must be My Hands Are Cold, My Feet Are Cold.

1280
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.269
Is that right?

1281
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.769
- This is... - What is it?

1282
00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.670
It's Mat Flipping.

1283
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:33.239
- Put the mittens on. - What is it?

1284
00:46:33.239 --> 00:46:35.809
Flip the mats on the floor.

1285
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:39.449
- You win if you flip more mats. - Is it difficult?

1286
00:46:39.449 --> 00:46:40.550
- What? - With the mittens?

1287
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.050
(Is this possible?)

1288
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:43.320
- Put the mittens on. - Who's good at it?

1289
00:46:43.719 --> 00:46:45.250
(I can do this.)

1290
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.389
Having long nails makes it easier.

1291
00:46:47.389 --> 00:46:48.659
- Show me your nails. - They aren't long,

1292
00:46:48.659 --> 00:46:50.059
- I have long nails. - but I know how to play it.

1293
00:46:50.389 --> 00:46:52.329
- I have long nails. - I know a technique.

1294
00:46:52.329 --> 00:46:53.460
Which technique?

1295
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.099
- As the floor... - Don't we flip them?

1296
00:46:55.099 --> 00:46:57.130
- We shouldn't lift them. - What do we do?

1297
00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.969
We should pile them and flip them when there's space.

1298
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.239
- Pile them together. - I bet the mats stick.

1299
00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:04.840
- We can't lift them. - Listen.

1300
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.440
We'll announce beforehand.

1301
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.780
Ye Rin will play.

1302
00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.650
It's better for a calm person to play.

1303
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:11.949
If Ye Rin plays,

1304
00:47:12.219 --> 00:47:13.550
- Seong Wu should play. - Seong Wu?

1305
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.619
(Here's Seong Wu.)

1306
00:47:15.019 --> 00:47:16.690
My goodness.

1307
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.550
(Seong Wu has a determined look.)

1308
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:19.889
- Which color? - Is ours black?

1309
00:47:20.119 --> 00:47:22.559
- Okay. - Trust yourself.

1310
00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:23.789
Lay out the equal number of mats.

1311
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.960
I used to be a recreational activity instructor.

1312
00:47:26.429 --> 00:47:28.429
(Why can't you trust me?)

1313
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:30.969
- We need one more blue. - Is it equal?

1314
00:47:30.969 --> 00:47:32.369
- Wait. - It's stuck.

1315
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.340
Let it go.

1316
00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.969
What's wrong with you?

1317
00:47:35.969 --> 00:47:37.610
It's off the floor.

1318
00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:38.980
- That's not allowed. - It's the design.

1319
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.239
Please give me 60 dollars. I'll send them to a sauna.

1320
00:47:41.239 --> 00:47:43.710
- They're dirty. - I agree that I was wrong.

1321
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:45.679
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1322
00:47:45.679 --> 00:47:46.880
It's off the floor.

1323
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.949
Do you understand?

1324
00:47:48.179 --> 00:47:49.449
(Let's stick it to the floor.)

1325
00:47:49.449 --> 00:47:51.090
Stop it, Hyun Moo.

1326
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.320
You're unbelievable.

1327
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.889
I should kick you and make you pass out.

1328
00:47:56.059 --> 00:47:57.429
My goodness.

1329
00:47:57.429 --> 00:47:59.230
(All we have to do is win.)

1330
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.599
Let's do our best.

1331
00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:01.829
Get ready.

1332
00:48:02.369 --> 00:48:04.099
- Let's go. - It's ready.

1333
00:48:04.099 --> 00:48:05.130
- Get ready. - Let's go.

1334
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:07.369
(Serious Seong Wu plays against Ye Rin.)

1335
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.610
(These mats are slightly off the floor.)

1336
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.239
Get ready, set, go.

1337
00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:13.840
- Let's go, Ye Rin. - Let's go.

1338
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.909
- That's great, Ye Rin. - Let's go.

1339
00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.219
(She flips the ones that aren't stuck.)

1340
00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:22.820
- Come on. - Ye Rin.

1341
00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.090
- Ye Rin. - That's amazing.

1342
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.190
(However, he seems unstable.)

1343
00:48:29.489 --> 00:48:30.690
(Move your feet.)

1344
00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:33.000
(He got the hang of it.)

1345
00:48:34.329 --> 00:48:35.329
This one.

1346
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:37.269
(Did he get the hang of it? He seems lost.)

1347
00:48:37.269 --> 00:48:38.269
- Go. - There are two.

1348
00:48:38.269 --> 00:48:39.869
- What are you doing? - There are two.

1349
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.500
What are you doing?

1350
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.539
(She flips two simultaneously.)

1351
00:48:42.539 --> 00:48:43.769
There you go.

1352
00:48:44.139 --> 00:48:46.110
- Seong Wu. - Come on, Ye Rin.

1353
00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.909
(Ye Rin flipped twice as more.)

1354
00:48:48.909 --> 00:48:51.579
- Good job, Ye Rin. - Flip this one.

1355
00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:54.349
(Seong Wu screams for help.)

1356
00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.650
Seong Wu.

1357
00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.449
(Didn't you know a technique?)

1358
00:48:57.619 --> 00:48:58.659
Time is up.

1359
00:48:59.289 --> 00:49:01.159
- Seong Wu. - Ye Rin.

1360
00:49:01.159 --> 00:49:04.730
(Ye Rin wins.)

1361
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.800
- Come back. - He must be Demon.

1362
00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.800
(You said that you'll win.)

1363
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.070
Aren't you Demon?

1364
00:49:12.539 --> 00:49:14.039
- Was that intentional? - Seong Wu.

1365
00:49:14.039 --> 00:49:15.570
- How could you be so slow? - He's Demon.

1366
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.010
Come on, show us your face.

1367
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.079
We still have hope. Was it Locker Number seven?

1368
00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:21.480
- Yes. - If we win number one,

1369
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.250
we can block the diagonal.

1370
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:24.449
You're very positive.

1371
00:49:24.909 --> 00:49:26.849
- That's right. - Put them together.

1372
00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:27.949
Good job.

1373
00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:30.050
- Good job. - It was a fair game.

1374
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.190
(Team Su Geun aims for the diagonal.)

1375
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:32.289
What's next?

1376
00:49:32.289 --> 00:49:33.960
Let's continue the diagonal.

1377
00:49:34.119 --> 00:49:35.889
- Number 25. - We'll win next time.

1378
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.460
- Let's block Number 25. - We must win.

1379
00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.659
It'll be tough if we lose.

1380
00:49:38.659 --> 00:49:39.860
- Right. - We must win.

1381
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:42.469
- It'll be tough if we lose. - Ta-da.

1382
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:44.369
It's time for presents.

1383
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.199
Congratulations, you're the winner.

1384
00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:48.369
(Thank you very much.)

1385
00:49:48.639 --> 00:49:50.340
- What is it? - It's Lucky Box.

1386
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:55.579
(The team to choose the locker wins the locker for free.)

1387
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.250
(They can't believe it.)

1388
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:59.550
We got it.

1389
00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:01.119
- My goodness. - Unbelievable.

1390
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:02.119
(Why wasn't it ours?)

1391
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.449
(Everyone, look at this.)

1392
00:50:04.889 --> 00:50:06.559
(They're so excited.)

1393
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.889
- Great. - No way.

1394
00:50:08.889 --> 00:50:09.889
(Team Su Geun continues to advance.)

1395
00:50:09.889 --> 00:50:11.690
- That must be nice. - It's because...

1396
00:50:12.329 --> 00:50:13.800
Angel is on your side.

1397
00:50:14.059 --> 00:50:15.099
Go first.

1398
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:17.329
Go first.

1399
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:18.639
(They're reminded of Angel's movement.)

1400
00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:20.570
It's 25, not 19.

1401
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.469
- It's Locker Number 25. - We got lucky.

1402
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.139
(They have 2 lockers left.)

1403
00:50:25.139 --> 00:50:26.940
All we have to do is block it.

1404
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.150
- What kind of expression is that? - We have to block it.

1405
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.679
- We have to be strategic. - Let's go. What's next?

1406
00:50:32.679 --> 00:50:33.880
Look carefully.

1407
00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.449
If we win Locker Number one,

1408
00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:37.519
we can take over these rows.

1409
00:50:37.519 --> 00:50:38.820
Locker Number one is better.

1410
00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.190
- That's good. - Right?

1411
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.389
Let's choose Number one.

1412
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.829
- Check what's inside. - Number one.

1413
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:45.559
- One. - We could get lucky again.

1414
00:50:45.559 --> 00:50:46.730
(What's in Number one?)

1415
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.099
- What is it? - A flipper?

1416
00:50:48.099 --> 00:50:49.400
- It's a flipper. - What's that?

1417
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.400
- This? - It's jaegi.

1418
00:50:50.969 --> 00:50:53.070
(Su Geun is good at playing jaegi.)

1419
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.070
(Is it a game of jaegi?)

1420
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.440
(I'll win no matter what.)

1421
00:50:57.909 --> 00:51:01.139
It's jaegi.

1422
00:51:01.139 --> 00:51:02.550
(Let's play jaegi all night long.)

1423
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:04.409
- It's jaegi. - What about the flipper?

1424
00:51:05.079 --> 00:51:06.179
There's a flipper.

1425
00:51:06.179 --> 00:51:07.219
(We don't know yet.)

1426
00:51:07.219 --> 00:51:08.719
It's different with the flipper.

1427
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:10.389
We have to kick forward.

1428
00:51:10.389 --> 00:51:11.690
Maybe.

1429
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.460
We have to kick like this.

1430
00:51:13.719 --> 00:51:15.159
- That's right. - It's difficult.

1431
00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:16.630
Who wants to go first?

1432
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:17.659
Seong Wu.

1433
00:51:17.659 --> 00:51:19.730
(Seong Wu from Team Hyun Moo starts.)

1434
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.199
Can we kick like this?

1435
00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:23.869
Do we count the total?

1436
00:51:23.869 --> 00:51:24.869
(He represents failure.)

1437
00:51:24.929 --> 00:51:26.539
- Challenge. - That's great.

1438
00:51:26.599 --> 00:51:30.470
(Team Hyun Moo's catching up depends on this man.)

1439
00:51:30.719 --> 00:51:33.320
- Come on. - Ye Rin.

1440
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.590
- Ye Rin. - That's amazing.

1441
00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:39.390
(However, he seems unstable.)

1442
00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:41.539
- Challenge. - That's great.

1443
00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:43.770
(No more defeats this time)

1444
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:46.840
(Will he manage to win this time?)

1445
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.410
- 1, 2. - Good.

1446
00:51:55.434 --> 00:52:00.434
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] SBS E05 Master Key "Locker Bingo"</font> <font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1447
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:09.369
Do we count the total?

1448
00:52:09.369 --> 00:52:10.369
(He represents failure.)

1449
00:52:10.429 --> 00:52:12.039
- Challenge. - That's great.

1450
00:52:12.099 --> 00:52:15.170
(Team Hyun Moo's catching up depends on this man.)

1451
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:18.940
(Will he manage to win this time?)

1452
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.510
1, 2. - Good.

1453
00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.119
(Is it already over?)

1454
00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:26.849
(Yes, it's over.)

1455
00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:29.650
(Without a chance to prove himself...)

1456
00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.519
(the game is already over.)

1457
00:52:31.519 --> 00:52:33.860
Come back to your place.

1458
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.630
You're not in good shape today.

1459
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.559
- Why don't you... - I'll play.

1460
00:52:37.559 --> 00:52:39.630
- Eun Kwang. - Follow what I do.

1461
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.970
- Do 20. - I bet he's good at it.

1462
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.070
- Do 20, Eun Kwang. - Challenge.

1463
00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:46.070
(He looks like a jaegi player.)

1464
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:47.939
3, 4. That's good.

1465
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.970
7, 8, 9, 10.

1466
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.840
(He seems quite stable.)

1467
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.910
7, 8, 9.

1468
00:52:56.979 --> 00:52:58.919
10, 11, 12.

1469
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.320
(Eun Kwang kicks 10 times.)

1470
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.389
That was great.

1471
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.820
You did so well.

1472
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.019
How did you do it?

1473
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:06.490
- Is there a technique? - He's so good.

1474
00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:07.829
(The result is unbelievable.)

1475
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:09.030
- I should wear yours. - Who's next?

1476
00:53:09.189 --> 00:53:10.689
- Henry? - I'll try.

1477
00:53:10.689 --> 00:53:12.300
- Make it up to 12. - I'm confident.

1478
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.400
One on the right.

1479
00:53:13.729 --> 00:53:16.099
Gosh, I'm shocked that he kicked 12 times.

1480
00:53:16.099 --> 00:53:19.269
- Great! - Ready, set, go!

1481
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:22.809
- 13, 14. 14. - Great. Come on!

1482
00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:24.470
(The end)

1483
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.110
- Well done. - What did you do?

1484
00:53:26.139 --> 00:53:27.849
I think Henry is on our side.

1485
00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:30.680
- Next is Hong Bin. - It's like he's on our team.

1486
00:53:30.709 --> 00:53:32.820
- He's the ace. Ready and go. - Go!

1487
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.749
Start. 15, 16,

1488
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:36.019
17.

1489
00:53:36.749 --> 00:53:38.660
- My gosh. - 18.

1490
00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.160
(She gets hit by the jaegi.)

1491
00:53:42.289 --> 00:53:43.990
18. It was 18.

1492
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:45.599
- She got hit in the head. - I am all right.

1493
00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.760
- I am all right. - Are you okay?

1494
00:53:47.869 --> 00:53:50.400
It hit Wendy's head, so it's 18.

1495
00:53:50.599 --> 00:53:52.639
- I am okay. It hit my head. - It hit her head.

1496
00:53:52.999 --> 00:53:55.510
- You're good. - Stop it.

1497
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:57.880
- Instead of asking... - Our motto is "To cheat".

1498
00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.280
Wendy if she's all right, you went, "That's 18!"

1499
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.979
- How can you do that? - It's just...

1500
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.110
Wendy wanted this result too.

1501
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:05.849
Is it 18 then?

1502
00:54:06.579 --> 00:54:07.950
- 18... - She didn't say anything.

1503
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:09.519
Your hair is a mess.

1504
00:54:09.519 --> 00:54:11.590
- 17. - Okay.

1505
00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.090
Start from 17. Start.

1506
00:54:13.919 --> 00:54:16.189
- 18, 19. - 2 is a lot.

1507
00:54:16.189 --> 00:54:17.559
- Great job. - It's 19.

1508
00:54:17.559 --> 00:54:20.130
It's okay.

1509
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.900
- Hyun Moo might kick the air. - He's our ace.

1510
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.769
- 20. - He might do well.

1511
00:54:25.769 --> 00:54:27.499
- 20. - Don't hit even one.

1512
00:54:28.439 --> 00:54:30.910
20, 21. Wait.

1513
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.979
(What is he doing?)

1514
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:39.950
(Will he do well? It's just how we expected.)

1515
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.650
My goodness.

1516
00:54:43.289 --> 00:54:45.090
(He threw himself to the floor.)

1517
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:46.459
It's 21.

1518
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.689
There was a thud.

1519
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:49.889
- Great job. - Team Hyun Moo's score is 21.

1520
00:54:49.889 --> 00:54:52.130
Can't you count the one that hit my head?

1521
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.959
I think this is the best.

1522
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.169
Lifting it like this is the best. You know, right?

1523
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.369
- Who will go first? - Let's do this.

1524
00:54:58.769 --> 00:55:00.369
- I will do it first. - Great.

1525
00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:02.769
- Go, Se Woon. - Get 27.

1526
00:55:02.769 --> 00:55:04.979
- Their score is 21. Just hit 20. - Okay.

1527
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.639
Just hit 20?

1528
00:55:06.709 --> 00:55:09.079
- No pressure. Just 20. - 21?

1529
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:11.349
- It's difficult. - He's going to be good.

1530
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:13.320
- It's difficult. - I think he's going to be good.

1531
00:55:13.479 --> 00:55:15.050
Let's go. That's good, Se Woon.

1532
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.990
- What's this? - He's trying to balance.

1533
00:55:17.389 --> 00:55:19.320
- What's this, Se Woon? - Here we go.

1534
00:55:19.689 --> 00:55:21.229
You're doing good, Se Woon.

1535
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.160
I think he's going to hit two.

1536
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.729
- I think he's going to hit 2. - 1, 2, 3.

1537
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.829
(Isn't it too high?)

1538
00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.499
- Great. - He received it.

1539
00:55:33.939 --> 00:55:36.939
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1540
00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.209
- Good job! - 3, 4,

1541
00:55:38.209 --> 00:55:39.439
(How can he be so good?)

1542
00:55:39.439 --> 00:55:42.110
7, 8, 9, 10.

1543
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:44.280
8, 9, 10.

1544
00:55:44.519 --> 00:55:47.650
10, 11, 12, 13.

1545
00:55:49.749 --> 00:55:51.789
16.

1546
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:53.689
(It's a calamity.)

1547
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.189
(Henry sacrifices himself to stop Se Woon.)

1548
00:55:56.189 --> 00:55:57.329
Wait.

1549
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:59.499
Se Woon.

1550
00:55:59.829 --> 00:56:01.700
- I did it. - What was that?

1551
00:56:01.729 --> 00:56:03.130
How could he be so good?

1552
00:56:03.329 --> 00:56:05.539
- What was that? - He was so good.

1553
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.410
Even if the rest of us hit one each, it will be a tie.

1554
00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:10.439
Great job.

1555
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.880
Let's give it up for Se Woon.

1556
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.050
- He's great. - Don't be too good.

1557
00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.119
Anything is possible.

1558
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.119
- He's really good. - You should sit down and film.

1559
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.249
It's going to get really boring.

1560
00:56:23.289 --> 00:56:25.260
By the way, let's set a record.

1561
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.320
- Here we go. - Okay.

1562
00:56:27.519 --> 00:56:30.729
- 16, 17, 18. - That's good.

1563
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.099
- Here we go. - Go. 19,

1564
00:56:33.099 --> 00:56:34.329
- 20. - 20.

1565
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.340
- 21, 22, 23, 24, - He didn't say he'd start.

1566
00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.639
- 25, 26. - He has to start over.

1567
00:56:42.809 --> 00:56:45.240
- Go. - 28, 29.

1568
00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.840
(Team Su Geun has won, but they try to set the record.)

1569
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.910
Great.

1570
00:56:47.979 --> 00:56:49.780
- You saved the last one. - This is too boring.

1571
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.590
(They have already won.)

1572
00:56:55.289 --> 00:56:57.019
(We dedicate our victory to you.)

1573
00:56:57.019 --> 00:56:58.220
We won.

1574
00:56:59.559 --> 00:57:01.289
We won.

1575
00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:04.229
- We have 19 now. - We have 1 more to go.

1576
00:57:04.289 --> 00:57:06.959
- We just need one more. - Let's disappoint them...

1577
00:57:06.959 --> 00:57:08.630
- by getting 19. - Okay.

1578
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.900
- That would be so disappointing. - That would be very disappointing.

1579
00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.300
- What will you do? - What do you mean?

1580
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:16.769
- We'll go with 19. - Go with 6.

1581
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:19.240
- We choose 19. - If they get the Lucky Box...

1582
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.110
- I hope it's in here. - Lucky Box.

1583
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:25.919
(Which game is it?)

1584
00:57:25.919 --> 00:57:27.450
- Minus One Box? - How do you play this?

1585
00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:29.090
- Is it Minus One Box? - I don't know how to play this.

1586
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:30.550
- What's that? - It's a hula hoop.

1587
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:31.789
We have to go through it.

1588
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:34.559
You have to wear it.

1589
00:57:34.559 --> 00:57:36.090
It's Hula Hoop Human Tuho.

1590
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:39.329
You will throw hula hoops, and the other player will receive them.

1591
00:57:39.329 --> 00:57:40.829
- I am good at this. - Will you throw them to a person?

1592
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:42.499
Ye Rin is the only one slim enough for the hula hoop to go through.

1593
00:57:42.499 --> 00:57:43.829
- He's really good. - I can even throw a choux.

1594
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:46.099
- Really? - Eun Kwang is the master thrower.

1595
00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.570
Shouldn't someone with a small head be receiving them?

1596
00:57:49.669 --> 00:57:50.939
- What? - Are you allowed to move?

1597
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.709
You have to stand.

1598
00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:55.849
- He will throw. - Can we finally win?

1599
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:57.950
- Let's win. - Can we finally win one game?

1600
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:59.519
- Let's get 19. - Yes.

1601
00:57:59.519 --> 00:58:01.349
- Let's upset them. - Yes.

1602
00:58:01.419 --> 00:58:02.419
- Let's get 19. - Yes.

1603
00:58:02.419 --> 00:58:03.550
Let's do this.

1604
00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:06.689
Ready.

1605
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:11.430
(Will they have a great harmony?)

1606
00:58:12.559 --> 00:58:15.229
- Start. - You should throw vertically.

1607
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:18.769
- That's it. - Take it slowly.

1608
00:58:18.769 --> 00:58:20.200
- This... - That's it.

1609
00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:21.939
That's great.

1610
00:58:22.039 --> 00:58:23.309
(He received 5 in no time.)

1611
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.539
Come on, Henry.

1612
00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:25.740
(Henry received 6.)

1613
00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.209
I can't believe it.

1614
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:33.320
(They put on a circus.)

1615
00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.019
(We get to watch a circus for free.)

1616
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.760
- That's it. - Henry.

1617
00:58:40.919 --> 00:58:43.530
- It's too low. - Stay calm.

1618
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:44.930
- That's it. - Stay calm.

1619
00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:47.260
- Be calm. - Stay in the line.

1620
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:49.030
Be calm.

1621
00:58:49.769 --> 00:58:51.840
It fell. It fell.

1622
00:58:51.869 --> 00:58:55.169
Stop. This one is invalid. We should take one out.

1623
00:58:55.169 --> 00:58:56.769
- I will take one out. - Thank you.

1624
00:58:56.769 --> 00:58:59.079
It's all right.

1625
00:58:59.539 --> 00:59:01.550
- You did well. - That was really good.

1626
00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:02.809
I won't be able to do it.

1627
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:04.249
He received 12.

1628
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:05.720
He did well.

1629
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.849
I thought you were a seal.

1630
00:59:07.019 --> 00:59:08.849
- You were like a seal. - He threw them very well.

1631
00:59:08.889 --> 00:59:11.889
- You have a talent. - Let's get 19.

1632
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.419
- I will hold this. - I think they will be good.

1633
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:17.660
- I will hold this. - And... Look at his skill.

1634
00:59:17.729 --> 00:59:20.530
That's a meaningless skill.

1635
00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.599
(They show off the meaningless technique.)

1636
00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:25.439
(He plays games quite well too.)

1637
00:59:25.439 --> 00:59:29.010
- You should throw it farther. - Let's do it.

1638
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:34.010
(The small-headed Key will receive,)

1639
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.380
(and the game genius Min Ho will throw.)

1640
00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.320
(Will they finish the game this time?)

1641
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.389
Ready.

1642
00:59:42.249 --> 00:59:44.389
- Start. - Please.

1643
00:59:44.389 --> 00:59:45.889
They are very serious.

1644
00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:48.030
They're hopeless.

1645
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:49.090
(Key receives 1.)

1646
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:52.599
(Speed is more important than precision.)

1647
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.360
Throw it farther.

1648
00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.329
Min Ho, throw it farther.

1649
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:58.499
Farther, Min Ho. That's it.

1650
00:59:58.740 --> 00:59:59.869
We are in trouble.

1651
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.470
We have to do it again.

1652
01:00:02.169 --> 01:00:03.709
What's wrong with you? Min Ho.

1653
01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.240
You have to see where you are throwing.

1654
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.849
A little farther.

1655
01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.950
Get it, Key.

1656
01:00:09.209 --> 01:00:11.479
Once it goes through your head, hold it with your hand.

1657
01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:12.749
He's dropping everything.

1658
01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:16.019
Hold it with your hand.

1659
01:00:16.749 --> 01:00:18.260
That's a foul.

1660
01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:19.559
That's a foul.

1661
01:00:20.459 --> 01:00:21.689
Wait.

1662
01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:23.559
Eun Kwang is really good.

1663
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:26.030
(Watching them...)

1664
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.999
(makes us admire these guys.)

1665
01:00:28.099 --> 01:00:29.829
- Great. - Who's next?

1666
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:31.939
This is really difficult.

1667
01:00:31.939 --> 01:00:33.639
- We're ruined. - He dropped so many.

1668
01:00:33.939 --> 01:00:35.939
- 6, 7. - No way.

1669
01:00:35.939 --> 01:00:38.079
Congratulations.

1670
01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:39.410
Congratulations.

1671
01:00:39.709 --> 01:00:41.749
- Are you going to get 19? - We are getting this one.

1672
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.079
- We have hope now. - They won.

1673
01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:46.849
- We got hope now. - We should get 14.

1674
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:49.889
- 14. - There will be a twist.

1675
01:00:50.389 --> 01:00:51.490
There will be a twist in this drama.

1676
01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:54.630
(Slowly, Team Hyun Moo starts to catch up.)

1677
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:58.329
(They get the Lucky Box right after.)

1678
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.559
Four.

1679
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:04.570
(They win the Jaegi Revenge Match.)

1680
01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:06.999
- Go ahead. - This is Team Hyun Moo.

1681
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.439
We turn things around.

1682
01:01:09.439 --> 01:01:11.010
This is what a variety show ought to be.

1683
01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:13.539
- Which one will you get next? - Nine.

1684
01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:15.450
- We will go with 9. - 9. Please open it.

1685
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:17.650
- 9. - It's okay.

1686
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.320
- Maybe the gift box is inside. - It's a close fight.

1687
01:01:21.079 --> 01:01:22.919
- What's that? - What?

1688
01:01:23.249 --> 01:01:24.419
- Say the Number Like a Fool. - What?

1689
01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:27.990
Your mouth and your fingers should say a different number.

1690
01:01:28.289 --> 01:01:30.490
- This. - I know this.

1691
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.599
1, 6, 3, 1,

1692
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:34.999
- 5, 2. - 3, 4.

1693
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:37.499
- He's good. - Okay.

1694
01:01:37.499 --> 01:01:39.369
He's good.

1695
01:01:39.639 --> 01:01:42.070
Seong Wu is good. We have to win.

1696
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.840
- 102, 103. - I want to do it.

1697
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.340
Okay. Key.

1698
01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:49.479
You should regain your honor.

1699
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.010
Everything matters.

1700
01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:54.349
- We will play one round. - Look at Key.

1701
01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.820
- It's a war. - It's not a staring contest.

1702
01:01:55.889 --> 01:01:56.990
- 5. - 1.

1703
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:58.559
- 5. 4. - 1.

1704
01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:00.019
- 2. 3. - 3. 2.

1705
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:02.260
(What happened?)

1706
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:04.660
- You said the same number. - He did.

1707
01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.900
You said the same number.

1708
01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.400
- 5. 4. - 1. 2.

1709
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.039
3.

1710
01:02:12.039 --> 01:02:14.300
(You made a mistake, Seong Wu.)

1711
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.539
You said the same number.

1712
01:02:16.869 --> 01:02:19.309
- No. - 5, 4, 3.

1713
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:20.979
See?

1714
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:22.650
It was 5, 4, 3.

1715
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:26.380
We know what you were thinking.

1716
01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.289
(Daniel puts the sticker on Locker Number 9.)

1717
01:02:28.289 --> 01:02:30.050
We know what you were thinking.

1718
01:02:30.249 --> 01:02:32.360
You were working backwards.

1719
01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.320
But the middle number failed you

1720
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.389
This is why it happened.

1721
01:02:37.289 --> 01:02:38.430
(It's his charm to always lose without an exception.)

1722
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.930
Why didn't he think of that?

1723
01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:42.729
- The strategy was good. - It was good.

1724
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.139
But he should've thought it through.

1725
01:02:45.369 --> 01:02:46.539
It was fun.

1726
01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:49.510
I thought he was really good, but he said three like this.

1727
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:52.139
(He was so confident that nobody knew he lost.)

1728
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:54.039
This is great.

1729
01:02:54.039 --> 01:02:55.410
(Is luck with Team Su Geun?)

1730
01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:56.450
Put this on Locker Number 8.

1731
01:02:56.709 --> 01:02:58.619
- Number 8. - We are so lucky.

1732
01:03:00.019 --> 01:03:04.050
(In the Dice Building Game,)

1733
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.889
(Team Su Geun wins too.)

1734
01:03:05.889 --> 01:03:07.559
- We won! - Yes!

1735
01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:09.829
We play games so well.

1736
01:03:09.959 --> 01:03:12.160
We are really good.

1737
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.800
(They get Numbers 8 and 10.)

1738
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.269
- 6. - Let's go with 6.

1739
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:17.970
- 6. - 6 is great.

1740
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:18.970
6.

1741
01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.539
That's it.

1742
01:03:20.539 --> 01:03:23.139
- It must be something bad. - No.

1743
01:03:23.539 --> 01:03:24.979
- What is it? - I will toss this.

1744
01:03:24.979 --> 01:03:26.010
- What is this? - What's that?

1745
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.010
- What's that? - What is it?

1746
01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.450
- Are we wearing it? - I'm sure this is not it.

1747
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:31.720
Spinning a Ball Inside a Pantyhose.

1748
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.749
You have to wear it.

1749
01:03:32.749 --> 01:03:34.720
You have to wear the pantyhose which has a ball inside.

1750
01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.849
You have to spin your neck...

1751
01:03:36.849 --> 01:03:38.919
- and hit the target. - There's a target.

1752
01:03:38.919 --> 01:03:40.059
What's the target?

1753
01:03:40.059 --> 01:03:41.160
- What is it? - Is it the other player?

1754
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.229
- It must be that. - I think I can do this well.

1755
01:03:43.229 --> 01:03:44.860
- You have to hit this. - You should protect your image.

1756
01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.760
I will do it. It's all right.

1757
01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.869
You've done enough.

1758
01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:49.030
It's okay.

1759
01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:50.800
- You've done enough. - I'll try to make it stand.

1760
01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.570
(Su Geun sacrifices his image.)

1761
01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:54.070
(The pantyhose met the right person.)

1762
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.869
- He's really handsome. - I am ready.

1763
01:03:55.869 --> 01:03:58.180
I hope you will praise my self-sacrificing spirit.

1764
01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.639
They've got the images to protect.

1765
01:04:00.639 --> 01:04:01.650
It suits him very well.

1766
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:02.979
Hey!

1767
01:04:02.979 --> 01:04:05.450
How can you make her do it?

1768
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.849
(How can the team leader force her into wearing the pantyhose?)

1769
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:08.889
You are terrible.

1770
01:04:08.889 --> 01:04:10.889
- She volunteered for this. - You're terrible.

1771
01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.419
Then it's all right.

1772
01:04:13.289 --> 01:04:14.530
Who wants to do it?

1773
01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.229
How do you do it? Do you wear it...

1774
01:04:16.229 --> 01:04:18.559
and spin your head to hit the target?

1775
01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:20.930
- Wendy? - Should I do it?

1776
01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.499
(She must regret it now.)

1777
01:04:24.499 --> 01:04:26.869
- She should do it if she wants. - I didn't expect this.

1778
01:04:26.869 --> 01:04:28.070
Are you all right?

1779
01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:29.869
She looks beautiful.

1780
01:04:30.039 --> 01:04:32.340
1, 2, 3. Spin it.

1781
01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:35.280
- Great. - Stay behind the line, Wendy.

1782
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.450
- Here? How can I hit that? - She's a girl.

1783
01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.079
He looks better like that.

1784
01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.079
(The pantyhose made him more handsome.)

1785
01:04:41.079 --> 01:04:42.090
Thank you.

1786
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.789
He looks great now.

1787
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:45.490
(He looks like a supporting actor from a hero movie.)

1788
01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.019
He looks like a master.

1789
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.630
(Film me when you can.)

1790
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.530
I think he will make this popular.

1791
01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:55.800
He's like a game character.

1792
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.970
(He looks like a Kung Fu master.)

1793
01:04:57.970 --> 01:04:59.269
Let's do this.

1794
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.410
- Move back. - Let's go.

1795
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.610
(The pantyhose owner and the normal contestant compete.)

1796
01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:04.709
- Ready. - Wendy is going to win.

1797
01:05:04.939 --> 01:05:06.139
(The game begins.)

1798
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:07.880
- Go, team! - She's doing well.

1799
01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.880
Wendy.

1800
01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.950
A little bit higher.

1801
01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.280
A bit higher.

1802
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.820
(This game isn't about who spins it longer.)

1803
01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.550
- Start again. - Wait.

1804
01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.619
- Raise it. - You have to spin it harder.

1805
01:05:17.619 --> 01:05:18.619
(She wants to hit it, but she can't control the ball.)

1806
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.030
(Su Geun gets close.)

1807
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:24.559
(Hit it!)

1808
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.959
(He's so close,)

1809
01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:28.400
(but he can't hit it.)

1810
01:05:28.999 --> 01:05:30.430
(The ball goes very near the bottle.)

1811
01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:31.869
(It keeps happening.)

1812
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.200
(What is this?)

1813
01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:35.970
Come on!

1814
01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:38.709
(He cracks up.)

1815
01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:40.039
This is so funny.

1816
01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:41.139
This is funny.

1817
01:05:41.849 --> 01:05:45.050
(Don't laugh. I am serious.)

1818
01:05:45.979 --> 01:05:47.320
(I am determined to hit it.)

1819
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.419
(I will hit it.)

1820
01:05:48.419 --> 01:05:49.490
(Please hit it.)

1821
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:50.519
(The ball hits the table.)

1822
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.160
(This is mad.)

1823
01:05:54.729 --> 01:05:56.760
(It upsets him.)

1824
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:58.999
You can do it.

1825
01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.059
I am going to do it.

1826
01:06:01.059 --> 01:06:02.769
(I know it's funny, but don't laugh.)

1827
01:06:03.999 --> 01:06:06.139
(They spin it faster.)

1828
01:06:07.099 --> 01:06:10.240
(He's getting closer.)

1829
01:06:11.209 --> 01:06:12.740
You can do it!

1830
01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:16.780
(The ball hits the table again.)

1831
01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.220
(He can't believe it.)

1832
01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.189
Hurry up.

1833
01:06:26.189 --> 01:06:28.789
Hurry.

1834
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:31.660
This is so funny.

1835
01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.360
My stomach hurts.

1836
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.130
Come on.

1837
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:37.200
Wendy!

1838
01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:39.340
- She can do it. - Come on, Wendy!

1839
01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.800
You have to raise the ball.

1840
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.869
Raise your head.

1841
01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.369
Raise your head.

1842
01:06:44.369 --> 01:06:46.610
Lower your body.

1843
01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.610
- Don't lower your head. - Go forward.

1844
01:06:48.979 --> 01:06:50.309
- Come on. - That's not it.

1845
01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:54.380
(He becomes determined,)

1846
01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.950
(and he finally hits it.)

1847
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.919
(She did her best.)

1848
01:07:00.959 --> 01:07:02.430
(Good job spinning the ball.)

1849
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.930
Good job.

1850
01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:05.660
(Good job laughing.)

1851
01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.860
That was tough.

1852
01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:07.900
(He takes a deep breath.)

1853
01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:12.470
You should all play it.

1854
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:14.439
I've never seen such an annoying game.

1855
01:07:14.439 --> 01:07:16.369
It's the most annoying game ever.

1856
01:07:16.369 --> 01:07:17.769
It was annoying.

1857
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.680
That was amazing.

1858
01:07:20.039 --> 01:07:22.209
- It's over. - Locker Bingo.

1859
01:07:22.209 --> 01:07:25.119
Team Su Geun got Lockers 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

1860
01:07:25.119 --> 01:07:27.249
Bingo!

1861
01:07:27.249 --> 01:07:28.550
(Team Su Geun wins the Locker Bingo.)

1862
01:07:31.689 --> 01:07:34.019
- Let's go in. - You look really sad.

1863
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:36.490
Wendy is so gullible.

1864
01:07:37.559 --> 01:07:39.400
Wendy is very gullible.

1865
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.430
- The Demon revealed himself. - He's appealing himself less.

1866
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:44.769
- I said I won't talk any longer. - Is that right?

1867
01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.840
- I think he's given up. - I will keep my words.

1868
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.439
- Usually Angel appeals himself. - Yes.

1869
01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.110
Gather up, guys.

1870
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:51.110
Check what?

1871
01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:52.780
Five players will be randomly chosen.

1872
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.979
1 of them will have the Master Key, and the rest won't the Master Key.

1873
01:07:54.979 --> 01:07:56.150
It will show on the screen, right?

1874
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:57.479
Yes. We have to play together.

1875
01:07:57.479 --> 01:07:58.650
Let's go with this.

1876
01:07:58.749 --> 01:07:59.849
- Great. - Okay.

1877
01:07:59.849 --> 01:08:01.119
- Let's go with this. - Let's go.

1878
01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.419
This is actually a good one.

1879
01:08:02.419 --> 01:08:03.919
We can all see this together, right?

1880
01:08:03.919 --> 01:08:05.660
I am not sure about Key.

1881
01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:06.760
Key is making me confused.

1882
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.760
You just need to say the names of five people.

1883
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:10.289
Are you Angel or Demon?

1884
01:08:10.289 --> 01:08:12.099
I am Angel. I told you.

1885
01:08:12.099 --> 01:08:13.099
He's overreacting.

1886
01:08:13.099 --> 01:08:14.869
Why is the Angel overreacting?

1887
01:08:14.869 --> 01:08:17.229
I can't keep a poker face.

1888
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:18.800
- He's Angel. - Don't you know me?

1889
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.910
(Does Key have the other Master Key?)

1890
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:25.039
I think... Look. Seong Wu's name will appear.

1891
01:08:25.039 --> 01:08:26.610
(Or does Seong Wu have the other Master Key?)

1892
01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:28.150
My neck hurts.

1893
01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:31.220
Master Key is with 1 of these 5 people.

1894
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.849
- It will appear on the screen. - Let's see.

1895
01:08:32.849 --> 01:08:34.349
Let's take our time.

1896
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:35.990
I am certain that Daniel is in the list.

1897
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:42.130
(Who are the 5 people on the list of suspects?)

1898
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.999
(Lee Su Geun, Ong Seong Wu, Key, Jun Hyun Moo, Seo Eun Kwang)

1899
01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:51.669
(1 of them has the Master Key, and the rest doesn't.)

1900
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.669
Wait.

1901
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:57.110
It's what we expected.

1902
01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.380
It's...

1903
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.240
- Daniel. - He's overreacting.

1904
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.180
You're acting very well today.

1905
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:04.519
Don't wink.

1906
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.820
I think he intended it.

1907
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.960
It's because of what you said.

1908
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.259
I am convinced now.

1909
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:18.030
Looking at them, it seems like...

1910
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:20.330
- They don't have the answer. - something is up with Seong Wu.

1911
01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:22.799
They don't have the answer. They're not sure.

1912
01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:24.700
No. They got the names of five people.

1913
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:26.099
They didn't get...

1914
01:09:26.099 --> 01:09:27.969
- what they wanted. - I think we are...

1915
01:09:27.969 --> 01:09:29.469
- Are you happy with what you have? - The list includes...

1916
01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:32.040
the five people we are most suspicious of.

1917
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.809
So I personally feel very good about it.

1918
01:09:33.809 --> 01:09:35.580
- If we win the next game, - It's the last game.

1919
01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.150
we will check two people.

1920
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:39.849
Let's move onto the next game.

1921
01:09:39.849 --> 01:09:41.250
- I have no idea. - I know.

1922
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.189
We met today for the first time.

1923
01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:48.429
Who do you think it is? Who are you suspicious of?

1924
01:09:48.629 --> 01:09:50.660
You saw the five names on the screen.

1925
01:09:51.089 --> 01:09:52.200
Right?

1926
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.670
Why are you looking at me like that?

1927
01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:56.870
I've given up.

1928
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:57.870
Why?

1929
01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:00.570
When the game finishes, you will all regret it.

1930
01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:03.339
- Stop it. - I won't say longer.

1931
01:10:03.339 --> 01:10:05.839
No matter what I say, you don't believe it.

1932
01:10:05.839 --> 01:10:07.809
I believed it at first, but you kept talking.

1933
01:10:07.809 --> 01:10:10.410
So I won't say anything anymore. You won't believe me anyway,

1934
01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:11.979
- whatever I say. - Look.

1935
01:10:11.979 --> 01:10:13.320
- I want... - Through...

1936
01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.389
- to hear the truth. - a text message,

1937
01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:17.620
I checked Key's key.

1938
01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.219
Key checked my key.

1939
01:10:19.589 --> 01:10:21.019
We...

1940
01:10:21.019 --> 01:10:23.929
- checked each other's key. - He might be lying.

1941
01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:25.629
- They're deceiving each other. - If you lie, you're terrible.

1942
01:10:25.629 --> 01:10:27.360
They're deceiving each other.

1943
01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.229
I am not a bad person.

1944
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:31.769
This show is making me get scared of people.

1945
01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.540
Same here.

1946
01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:34.939
- I feel like a bad person. - When the game is over,

1947
01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:37.910
- you will be surprised. - I feel the same.

1948
01:10:38.009 --> 01:10:41.250
I can't talk as well as Key. I can't do this.

1949
01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:43.110
This is too difficult.

1950
01:10:43.179 --> 01:10:45.849
- This is really tough. - He's amazing.

1951
01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.750
- Anyway, that's it. - You might be acting.

1952
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:48.790
You might be acting now.

1953
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:49.950
I can't act.

1954
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:53.089
When he acts, he talks like he's from Seoul.

1955
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.660
I speak with Seoul accent well now.

1956
01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.860
- You're talking with Seoul accent. - I am good now.

1957
01:10:56.889 --> 01:10:58.200
I am falsely accused.

1958
01:10:59.059 --> 01:11:01.269
- What's going on? - I have no clue.

1959
01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:02.769
This is how I feel.

1960
01:11:02.769 --> 01:11:04.900
While shooting this show,

1961
01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:06.939
I wondered if this is what it's like being an adult.

1962
01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.410
(Master Key lets you experience the extremes.)

1963
01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:11.009
This is too difficult.

1964
01:11:11.009 --> 01:11:12.740
Is this what it's like to be an adult?

1965
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.549
Everyone gathered here somehow.

1966
01:11:15.549 --> 01:11:19.019
Daniel was acting like me last week.

1967
01:11:19.019 --> 01:11:22.219
You know what I mean, right? He's been overreacting.

1968
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:26.189
He was acting like Chan Yeol.

1969
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:28.030
If he continues acting like this,

1970
01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:31.530
Daniel is most likely to get many votes.

1971
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.200
He might get the most votes.

1972
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.969
Not many people think Daniel is Angel.

1973
01:11:35.969 --> 01:11:37.500
People might vote him as Demon.

1974
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.939
Anyway, we have the key.

1975
01:11:38.939 --> 01:11:41.070
But there's a justification.

1976
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:42.139
We have the key.

1977
01:11:42.139 --> 01:11:44.269
Seong Wu will choose Daniel.

1978
01:11:44.269 --> 01:11:46.439
They are going to divide the gold.

1979
01:11:46.439 --> 01:11:47.580
(He suggests that Seong Wu and Daniel are allies.)

1980
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:48.910
What's that?

1981
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.479
That's a new way to approach it.

1982
01:11:50.479 --> 01:11:53.620
Look. He's already got three votes.

1983
01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.049
If four of you vote for him too,

1984
01:11:56.049 --> 01:11:58.420
and if he turns out to be Demon, it will get multiplied by five.

1985
01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:00.120
- Seven times... - That is a new approach.

1986
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.929
5 is 35. He's going to get 35.

1987
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:05.059
If they get 35 gold keys,

1988
01:12:05.059 --> 01:12:07.360
they will have a party.

1989
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.129
But that's based on the premise that Daniel is the Demon.

1990
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:11.769
If Daniel is the Angel,

1991
01:12:11.769 --> 01:12:14.269
will the ones who voted for him get awarded too?

1992
01:12:14.269 --> 01:12:15.309
- Yes. - Right.

1993
01:12:15.309 --> 01:12:16.939
- We have to find the Angel. - We have to find the Angel.

1994
01:12:16.939 --> 01:12:18.679
- You... - You are a voter.

1995
01:12:18.679 --> 01:12:19.910
I am a voter.

1996
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:21.549
He gave up a while ago.

1997
01:12:21.549 --> 01:12:23.450
He's a voter.

1998
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:24.950
Okay.

1999
01:12:25.349 --> 01:12:27.349
Do you want to be treated?

2000
01:12:27.349 --> 01:12:29.719
- I'm losing faith in him. - I don't think it's him.

2001
01:12:29.719 --> 01:12:31.820
We should form an alliance.

2002
01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.589
Yes.

2003
01:12:33.589 --> 01:12:35.790
These two are together.

2004
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:37.389
(Investigation Mission 3)

2005
01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.660
(What is the 3rd mission?)

2006
01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.330
What is this?

2007
01:12:42.729 --> 01:12:43.870
(Extra-large size bed is launched.)

2008
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:46.540
We should all get some sleep.

2009
01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:47.939
(It will be sold out soon! Order it now.)

2010
01:12:47.939 --> 01:12:49.509
I am too shy to sleep here.

2011
01:12:49.509 --> 01:12:51.839
I called my wife and told her I won't be coming home.

2012
01:12:52.009 --> 01:12:54.009
We get to sleep here.

2013
01:12:54.009 --> 01:12:55.450
- Can we all go up? - Let's go up.

2014
01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:56.780
What is this?

2015
01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.320
- This is amazing. - Who wants to sleep over?

2016
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.179
Who can sleep here?

2017
01:13:00.179 --> 01:13:01.290
(Hyun Moo rushes onto the bed.)

2018
01:13:01.849 --> 01:13:03.219
It's a duck-down bedding.

2019
01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.089
I am sorry, but...

2020
01:13:07.089 --> 01:13:09.089
- What is this? - What kind of a game is this?

2021
01:13:09.729 --> 01:13:13.400
- This is great. - I wish my bed is this big.

2022
01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.830
- I wish this was my bed. - I know.

2023
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.400
- Electricity game. - I see something up there.

2024
01:13:18.599 --> 01:13:21.370
- This is perfect for the king game. - What is that?

2025
01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:24.540
- What is that up there? - There's a monitor.

2026
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.240
Is it going to pour water?

2027
01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.280
What is that?

2028
01:13:27.509 --> 01:13:29.780
- Does it have water inside? - It's going to pour water.

2029
01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.450
- My goodness. - It's on night mode.

2030
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:33.849
It's on night mode?

2031
01:13:34.349 --> 01:13:35.349
They're going to turn off the light.

2032
01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:38.120
There's going to be a motion on the monitor.

2033
01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.790
When the monitor turns off, it will get dark,

2034
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.360
and we have to follow that motion.

2035
01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.660
When the light comes back on,

2036
01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.629
we have to be in that motion.

2037
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:46.660
(Equal, unequal)

2038
01:13:46.799 --> 01:13:50.170
If we fail, strings that hold the female player will disconnect.

2039
01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:51.439
(A penalty to a female member when they fail)

2040
01:13:51.439 --> 01:13:53.500
- They're going to fall. - They're going to fall on that.

2041
01:13:53.939 --> 01:13:55.170
- Are we supposed to save them? - Yes.

2042
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:56.740
It will be very scary when the string disconnects.

2043
01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.210
I know.

2044
01:13:58.210 --> 01:13:59.780
The motion will be...

2045
01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:02.110
on the monitor for five seconds.

2046
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:04.280
You must not miss it.

2047
01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.849
We're protecting the princesses from each team.

2048
01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.990
It's weird.

2049
01:14:09.219 --> 01:14:12.320
I want to lie down here.

2050
01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:14.360
Can we take a nap?

2051
01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.960
This is why we shouldn't sit down.

2052
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.160
Once I sit down, I want to lie down.

2053
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:19.429
Yes, me too.

2054
01:14:19.429 --> 01:14:21.830
Let's just have fun and drink soju.

2055
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.099
You don't even drink.

2056
01:14:24.099 --> 01:14:25.170
The food is delicious.

2057
01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.040
(Food over soju)

2058
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.339
I love food.

2059
01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:30.269
Gosh. You're such a punk.

2060
01:14:30.839 --> 01:14:31.910
(He nags like an old man.)

2061
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:33.379
He sounds like a grandfather.

2062
01:14:33.379 --> 01:14:34.849
My goodness.

2063
01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:36.650
Let's begin now.

2064
01:14:36.650 --> 01:14:38.080
Lie down.

2065
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.250
(2 minutes before the 1st darkness)

2066
01:14:40.479 --> 01:14:43.120
Get our heads together.

2067
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.320
What are you doing?

2068
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.689
(Passion, my foot.)

2069
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:48.830
The bed is so red.

2070
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:50.360
I can't do this anymore.

2071
01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:55.200
(This is nice.)

2072
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:59.570
I see the difference between the winning team and the losing team.

2073
01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.839
I didn't understand why we were losing at first.

2074
01:15:02.809 --> 01:15:04.170
(The difference between dispassion and passion)

2075
01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:06.240
- They're having a discussion. - Lie down.

2076
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.950
You can just relax, guys.

2077
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:09.049
Sure.

2078
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.650
- Sure. - Get it?

2079
01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:12.450
- This is nice. - This is our room.

2080
01:15:13.019 --> 01:15:15.049
We have to get up all at once.

2081
01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:16.750
Let's do this.

2082
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:17.920
(Which team will save their princess?)

2083
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.689
- We'll save you. - I'm falling asleep.

2084
01:15:21.889 --> 01:15:23.129
Hey.

2085
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.030
- Ye Rin. - He keeps saying that.

2086
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:27.599
Don't waste electricity.

2087
01:15:27.599 --> 01:15:29.769
Be ready to fall, Wendy.

2088
01:15:30.299 --> 01:15:31.339
I want to punch him.

2089
01:15:31.339 --> 01:15:32.799
- Be ready to fall. - What is that?

2090
01:15:32.839 --> 01:15:34.070
What is that?

2091
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.509
- Hey. - Handstand.

2092
01:15:36.509 --> 01:15:38.009
It's easy.

2093
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.479
- Let's begin. - Who?

2094
01:15:39.509 --> 01:15:40.879
You do the handstand.

2095
01:15:40.879 --> 01:15:43.179
He and I will support you.

2096
01:15:43.179 --> 01:15:44.780
- With Hong Bin. - Get ready.

2097
01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:46.820
(I'll handstand with Hong Bin. Where are you?)

2098
01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.990
(I'm here. Where's number five?)

2099
01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:52.589
(Both teams begin moving.)

2100
01:15:52.759 --> 01:15:54.259
Where are you?

2101
01:15:54.259 --> 01:15:55.290
Se Woon's right here.

2102
01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:56.689
Grab Se Woon first.

2103
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.559
- Towards the camera. - He's on your left.

2104
01:15:58.559 --> 01:16:00.900
- I'm sorry. - Make it fun, Se Woon.

2105
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:01.929
I can't see anything.

2106
01:16:01.929 --> 01:16:03.070
- Go on your hands. - I can't see anything.

2107
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:04.400
Stand up.

2108
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.740
- Don't touch my butt. - I can't see anything.

2109
01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:07.469
Go on your hands.

2110
01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:11.339
(What is the result?)

2111
01:16:17.479 --> 01:16:19.780
(Not identical)

2112
01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.950
We're close.

2113
01:16:21.019 --> 01:16:22.019
(The string disconnects.)

2114
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:26.790
(Princesses lost one string each.)

2115
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.429
That's what happens?

2116
01:16:28.429 --> 01:16:29.759
We have to be faster.

2117
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:32.160
- Let me see. - I'm sorry.

2118
01:16:32.729 --> 01:16:34.129
You have to bare it.

2119
01:16:34.129 --> 01:16:35.129
We're lying down.

2120
01:16:35.129 --> 01:16:36.200
(He doesn't care about his princess.)

2121
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.599
- As you know... - I'm sorry.

2122
01:16:38.599 --> 01:16:41.000
You should say sorry at least.

2123
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.839
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

2124
01:16:42.839 --> 01:16:44.309
- I'm sorry. - Come here.

2125
01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:45.740
I'm sorry.

2126
01:16:46.009 --> 01:16:48.009
Remember your position.

2127
01:16:48.049 --> 01:16:49.950
- On your position. - Let's get at least one.

2128
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:52.549
I think we will win with just one answer.

2129
01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:55.719
- Let's grab our hands. - Go on your hands.

2130
01:16:55.719 --> 01:16:57.450
Let's say our names.

2131
01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:00.160
The numbers are confusing.

2132
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.189
Let's go with names.

2133
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.990
(He steps on Su Geun's foot.)

2134
01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.429
Why would you...

2135
01:17:06.559 --> 01:17:07.830
cross the line?

2136
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:10.030
Why would you cross the line?

2137
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:11.030
(He punishes the person who crossed the line.)

2138
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:12.769
- He stepped on him. - That's the line.

2139
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.269
He stepped on Su Geun.

2140
01:17:14.269 --> 01:17:15.269
(Don't cross the line.)

2141
01:17:15.269 --> 01:17:16.710
Good job.

2142
01:17:16.710 --> 01:17:18.740
That was a great move.

2143
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.710
I can't believe you.

2144
01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:22.280
Jun Hyun Moo!

2145
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.849
Fine.

2146
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:27.219
What's wrong?

2147
01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:29.019
- Did you get beat? - No.

2148
01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:30.889
- What's wrong? - Oh, that.

2149
01:17:30.889 --> 01:17:32.189
(What is that skill?)

2150
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.719
That helps you see better in dark.

2151
01:17:33.719 --> 01:17:34.990
I couldn't see anything at all.

2152
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:36.589
That helps you see better?

2153
01:17:36.589 --> 01:17:37.929
You get used to the darkness.

2154
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.759
Oh, getting used to the darkness?

2155
01:17:39.759 --> 01:17:41.170
(Get used to the darkness by covering one eye.)

2156
01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:43.400
You have to see the motion.

2157
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.700
What if I go like this?

2158
01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:45.969
(Mysterious home remedy)

2159
01:17:45.969 --> 01:17:48.670
That's useless.

2160
01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:51.179
Don't think it's useless. Try it.

2161
01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.349
The light goes off after the motion.

2162
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:58.519
- Give me. - All the best!

2163
01:17:58.519 --> 01:17:59.549
(Any more mistakes are critical to princess.)

2164
01:17:59.549 --> 01:18:02.150
- Let's get it this time. - He sounds like an old man.

2165
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:05.660
Hey, don't waste the energy.

2166
01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.420
(Their eyes widen.)

2167
01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.059
- I've said it so many times. - Okay.

2168
01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.790
- I've said it so many times. - Okay.

2169
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:12.160
Okay.

2170
01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.160
I've said it so many times.

2171
01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:14.900
- Okay. - Start now.

2172
01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.170
No.

2173
01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:17.330
What is it?

2174
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.439
Ong Seong Wu.

2175
01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:21.469
(I'll hold. Let's hold Ong Seong Wu.)

2176
01:18:21.469 --> 01:18:23.040
(1, 2, 3.)

2177
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:25.280
(They're in order this time.)

2178
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.679
We got it.

2179
01:18:28.049 --> 01:18:30.780
- It's scary. - It's done.

2180
01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:31.780
Okay. We're done.

2181
01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.019
- It's done. - We got it.

2182
01:18:34.019 --> 01:18:36.389
(The problem lies on how detailed it is.)

2183
01:18:39.259 --> 01:18:41.189
- We both got it. - The direction of the face.

2184
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:42.530
It's this way.

2185
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:44.830
(It's identical.)

2186
01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.400
Does the direction matter?

2187
01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.429
(It's not identical.)

2188
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.969
(My goodness.)

2189
01:18:54.809 --> 01:18:55.809
I'm sorry.

2190
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:58.710
My goodness.

2191
01:18:58.879 --> 01:19:00.410
My goodness.

2192
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:01.549
Gosh.

2193
01:19:01.549 --> 01:19:02.580
She should be lower.

2194
01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.479
- What if she hits the ground? - Work harder.

2195
01:19:05.519 --> 01:19:06.519
Cover your face.

2196
01:19:06.519 --> 01:19:07.580
Work harder.

2197
01:19:08.019 --> 01:19:11.019
You should've been careful. That was a lousy job.

2198
01:19:11.019 --> 01:19:12.360
- Do you get it? - Yes.

2199
01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.559
We won.

2200
01:19:13.559 --> 01:19:15.689
How can you throw me like that?

2201
01:19:16.059 --> 01:19:17.360
Seong Wu.

2202
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.360
Seong Wu.

2203
01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360
(He fell to the ground.)

2204
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.460
I'm so sorry.

2205
01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:21.469
(Don't make me sad.)

2206
01:19:21.469 --> 01:19:22.570
We were just so happy.

2207
01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:24.700
I fell to the ground.

2208
01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.799
Good. We're doing great.

2209
01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.939
- Let's do it. - There are so many.

2210
01:19:28.939 --> 01:19:30.170
Are you on your feet?

2211
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:32.610
I don't want to fall.

2212
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:34.439
- Okay. - Good luck.

2213
01:19:34.439 --> 01:19:35.950
(3rd round begins.)

2214
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:36.979
Let's do it.

2215
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:41.080
Last month bill was over 100 dollars.

2216
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:43.320
Turn the light off! We're ready.

2217
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.360
Save the energy. Turn the light off!

2218
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.559
Hey.

2219
01:19:48.259 --> 01:19:49.729
It's the same.

2220
01:19:49.929 --> 01:19:51.599
- It's the same. - No.

2221
01:19:51.599 --> 01:19:53.160
Don't go on your knees.

2222
01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.500
(Counting until the light goes off)

2223
01:19:55.769 --> 01:19:56.929
Don't go on your knees.

2224
01:19:56.929 --> 01:19:59.670
(Light goes off.)

2225
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.000
Okay.

2226
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.910
Henry in rear.

2227
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:04.139
On your knees.

2228
01:20:04.139 --> 01:20:05.879
Hands on your knees.

2229
01:20:05.879 --> 01:20:07.110
Hands on your knees.

2230
01:20:08.479 --> 01:20:10.009
- Go up first. - Go up.

2231
01:20:10.009 --> 01:20:11.650
Don't go on your knees, Henry.

2232
01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:13.080
- Go up first. - Go up.

2233
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.889
Don't go on your knees, Henry.

2234
01:20:14.889 --> 01:20:16.389
Go up first.

2235
01:20:17.049 --> 01:20:18.059
It's over.

2236
01:20:18.389 --> 01:20:20.290
They're not up yet.

2237
01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:21.990
That's not what it looks like.

2238
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:23.629
They're not up yet.

2239
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:24.660
You shouldn't be on your knees.

2240
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:28.629
(Team Su Geun matches the motion.)

2241
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.429
(She screams.)

2242
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.299
(Princess Wendy loses one string.)

2243
01:20:33.299 --> 01:20:35.139
You should've done this.

2244
01:20:35.139 --> 01:20:37.269
- I didn't see it. - You should've done this.

2245
01:20:37.269 --> 01:20:38.679
You should've done this.

2246
01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.240
My team's awesome.

2247
01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.349
It was my fault.

2248
01:20:41.349 --> 01:20:42.780
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

2249
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.410
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

2250
01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:47.780
Both girls...

2251
01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.189
have one string left.

2252
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:51.290
Are they going to fall if we don't get it this time?

2253
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:52.290
(The team that wins this time is the winner.)

2254
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:53.559
- They're going to fall. - It will be hard this time.

2255
01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.790
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

2256
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:57.389
(The final round begins.)

2257
01:20:57.389 --> 01:20:58.400
Let's do it.

2258
01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.759
I want something hard.

2259
01:20:59.759 --> 01:21:00.830
Are you going to say anything?

2260
01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:02.969
- Hey. - She's out.

2261
01:21:02.969 --> 01:21:04.429
Don't make me repeat it!

2262
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.469
Why would you swear at her?

2263
01:21:07.469 --> 01:21:08.540
(Why are you so mean to your family?)

2264
01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.910
Why would you be so mean to her?

2265
01:21:10.509 --> 01:21:14.379
Turn the lights off to save the energy.

2266
01:21:14.379 --> 01:21:16.710
- Turn the light off. - Are you an old man or woman?

2267
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:18.450
(The last match for the last Key Guide)

2268
01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:22.320
(Which team will get the Key Guide through darkness?)

2269
01:21:24.759 --> 01:21:26.059
- There is it. - What is that?

2270
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:28.129
Put your arms out, and put your hands together.

2271
01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:30.790
(Counting before the light goes off)

2272
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:33.000
- In the middle. - Put your hands together.

2273
01:21:33.129 --> 01:21:34.259
I'll be in the middle.

2274
01:21:34.259 --> 01:21:35.269
Okay.

2275
01:21:35.269 --> 01:21:37.030
Back to your position.

2276
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:38.900
- Jun Hyun Moo in the center. - Jun Hyun Moo in the center.

2277
01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.540
- Jun Hyun Moo in the center. - You have to support two people.

2278
01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.540
Next to my elbows.

2279
01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.139
(It's important to stand on the knees.)

2280
01:21:45.139 --> 01:21:46.179
People on the top, put your hands together.

2281
01:21:46.179 --> 01:21:47.780
- I'll go up. - It hurts.

2282
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:50.450
Hold on to his elbows.

2283
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:51.450
(He slipped.)

2284
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:52.620
Again.

2285
01:21:55.719 --> 01:21:56.820
Come here.

2286
01:21:58.689 --> 01:22:00.559
(Both teams are done.)

2287
01:22:00.559 --> 01:22:04.830
(Which team will get the last Key Guide?)

2288
01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.330
- Step on my thigh. - Now.

2289
01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:09.170
(Hold on.)

2290
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.240
(He slipped.)

2291
01:22:14.939 --> 01:22:17.110
(Team Su Geun matches.)

2292
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:19.080
(She falls.)

2293
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:22.610
(Princess Wendy to chicken feather bed)

2294
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:26.679
(Princess Wendy is suffering due to low quality guards.)

2295
01:22:26.679 --> 01:22:27.820
I'm fine.

2296
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:30.549
I'm so sorry.

2297
01:22:30.589 --> 01:22:32.189
- Ye Rin! - You're safe.

2298
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:33.820
- Ye Rin! - We got it!

2299
01:22:34.089 --> 01:22:35.360
It was amazing.

2300
01:22:35.429 --> 01:22:37.360
Are you okay, Wendy?

2301
01:22:37.689 --> 01:22:39.559
- Because... - I'm fine.

2302
01:22:39.559 --> 01:22:40.860
Team Su Geun wins.

2303
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.870
(Team Su Geun wins the last Key Guide.)

2304
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:44.000
The last Key Guide.

2305
01:22:44.429 --> 01:22:46.200
Good job, Ye Rin.

2306
01:22:46.939 --> 01:22:49.339
This is annoying.

2307
01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:50.339
We lost.

2308
01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:54.610
I'd be upset if they doubt me when I put so much effort.

2309
01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:58.019
(Who is Angel and Demon?)

2310
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.490
We're here.

2311
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:03.290
This is our last chance.

2312
01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:07.290
It's time for us to open the Key Guide.

2313
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:10.290
Don't listen to them. Make the decision on you own.

2314
01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.160
Everyone must gather.

2315
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:15.969
We won the last Key Guide.

2316
01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.570
- We won the last one. - Yes.

2317
01:23:18.639 --> 01:23:21.540
As we've discussed,

2318
01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:24.509
those two will check the other team.

2319
01:23:24.509 --> 01:23:26.080
Then there's no point.

2320
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.509
Then no one else will know.

2321
01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.719
Let's select two people from our team...

2322
01:23:31.879 --> 01:23:34.589
- with rock paper scissors. - All right.

2323
01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:37.019
You must win.

2324
01:23:37.019 --> 01:23:39.519
You don't need to win if you want to keep yourself secret.

2325
01:23:39.519 --> 01:23:41.629
Two people. Rock paper scissors.

2326
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:44.530
Rock paper scissors.

2327
01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:46.599
- You two. - That was fast.

2328
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:48.330
- We check? - Yes.

2329
01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:49.629
Go up.

2330
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:51.200
You'll be surprised to see mine.

2331
01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.639
How about Seong Wu's?

2332
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.040
If I were you, I'd choose him.

2333
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.580
Seong Wu's pretty ambitious.

2334
01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.179
- He's very passionate. - Yes, he is.

2335
01:24:02.179 --> 01:24:03.710
If you check me,

2336
01:24:04.979 --> 01:24:06.049
you'll faint.

2337
01:24:06.679 --> 01:24:08.920
You'll fall to the ground.

2338
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.189
Let's find out.

2339
01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:11.889
Seong Wu.

2340
01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.960
Your reaction will...

2341
01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.830
He's writing a fiction.

2342
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:19.860
- Let's go. - He's writing a fiction.

2343
01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.469
I choose Seong Wu.

2344
01:24:22.469 --> 01:24:23.769
He's aiming directly at him.

2345
01:24:23.769 --> 01:24:27.040
(He aims at Seong Wu.)

2346
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.469
- He's making it sure. - He's making it sure.

2347
01:24:28.469 --> 01:24:30.710
You've done a good job.

2348
01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:34.849
(What's the truth behind his mysterious smile?)

2349
01:24:34.849 --> 01:24:36.150
We're abandoning him.

2350
01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:37.250
(Seong Wu's about to reveal his key.)

2351
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.519
We're not abandoning him.

2352
01:24:40.519 --> 01:24:41.920
- Can I see it too? - Good job.

2353
01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.620
Let's go.

2354
01:24:44.219 --> 01:24:45.519
They will start laughing.

2355
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:47.960
Can I trust you?

2356
01:24:48.589 --> 01:24:49.990
My goodness.

2357
01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.929
- Is this key the Master Key? - Is this key the Master Key?

2358
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:56.700
Good job.

2359
01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:57.839
Observe their faces.

2360
01:24:58.099 --> 01:25:00.070
- I'm not sure. - I can't wait.

2361
01:25:00.439 --> 01:25:02.240
(Seong Wu's key was a hot issue of this Master Key.)

2362
01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.540
- Let's share it with the team. - I want to see it too,

2363
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:08.549
(Is Seong Wu really an Angel?)

2364
01:25:08.549 --> 01:25:09.809
but I can't.

2365
01:25:09.809 --> 01:25:11.379
(Is Seong Wu really an Angel?)

2366
01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.219
I'm an Angel.

2367
01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.790
- I can't believe it. - I'm serious.

2368
01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.120
I'm an Angel.

2369
01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:24.500
(Seong Wu kept arguing that he's an Angel.)

2370
01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:27.729
(He even persuades his team.)

2371
01:25:27.729 --> 01:25:29.469
(24 hours is not enough to argue he's an Angel.)

2372
01:25:29.469 --> 01:25:32.070
You'll all regret when this is over.

2373
01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:37.839
(You don't know until you check.)

2374
01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.879
(Was Seong Wu telling the truth?)

2375
01:25:42.879 --> 01:25:46.849
(We'll find out now.)

2376
01:25:49.849 --> 01:25:53.360
(Seong Wu's key is not a Mater Key.)

2377
01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:57.729
(Seong Wu's key is not a Mater Key.)

2378
01:25:57.729 --> 01:26:00.360
(Was he a mere voter?)

2379
01:26:00.929 --> 01:26:03.269
(I'm sorry.)

2380
01:26:03.269 --> 01:26:06.000
(Seong Wu's key is not a Mater Key.)

2381
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.299
They're acting.

2382
01:26:07.299 --> 01:26:09.610
Good job.

2383
01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:11.580
Give me a hug.

2384
01:26:12.309 --> 01:26:14.210
Good job.

2385
01:26:14.809 --> 01:26:17.349
I can't tell because it's their first day.

2386
01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:19.080
- Give us a hint. - Don't be like this.

2387
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.790
Wait a minute. This is giving me a headache.

2388
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:23.189
That might be a trick.

2389
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:26.420
Tell us if you're an Angel.

2390
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:29.030
- Don't confuse me. - I said I'm the Angel.

2391
01:26:30.490 --> 01:26:31.929
Then why won't you tell me?

2392
01:26:31.929 --> 01:26:34.599
(Who's telling the truth?)

2393
01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:36.830
I saw Daniel talking.

2394
01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:40.570
He kept saying he's the Angel.

2395
01:26:40.939 --> 01:26:44.240
It looked like he was lying.

2396
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.879
What if he was faking it?

2397
01:26:46.879 --> 01:26:49.280
I've seen Daniel for a long time.

2398
01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:52.780
I know his personality.

2399
01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.320
When he can't help it, he's like, "Whatever."

2400
01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.559
"Since I'm the real one,"

2401
01:26:58.589 --> 01:27:01.160
- "whatever." - So?

2402
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:03.830
I think Daniel is the Angel.

2403
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:06.059
I was a Demon last time.

2404
01:27:06.129 --> 01:27:09.900
I was like Daniel.

2405
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.339
I pretended I was the Angel.

2406
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:15.139
- Were you like him? - Kind of.

2407
01:27:15.309 --> 01:27:18.939
I got the feeling that Daniel felt...

2408
01:27:19.509 --> 01:27:23.080
what I felt when I talked to Su Geun.

2409
01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.719
(Daniel smells like a Demon.)

2410
01:27:25.379 --> 01:27:26.549
I will...

2411
01:27:28.219 --> 01:27:29.349
trust you.

2412
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:33.490
This is confusing.

2413
01:27:35.129 --> 01:27:37.059
You don't have to vote if you don't want to.

2414
01:27:37.089 --> 01:27:39.960
I just need to prove it.

2415
01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:41.729
This is confusing.

2416
01:27:41.729 --> 01:27:44.030
(Who are the Angel and the Demon?)

2417
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:45.799
I really can't tell.

2418
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:48.809
- Are you an Angel? - I don't know.

2419
01:27:48.839 --> 01:27:51.540
Let's share for the last time.

2420
01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.839
I think sharing is good.

2421
01:27:53.879 --> 01:27:55.849
I was pretty offended today.

2422
01:27:55.849 --> 01:27:57.580
(Master Key owner, Kang Daniel is nervous.)

2423
01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:00.379
Write the name of the person you think is the Angel.

2424
01:28:00.379 --> 01:28:01.620
(Vote for the person they think is the owner of the Angel Master Key.)

2425
01:28:02.389 --> 01:28:04.420
- Are you writing it? - Yes, Seong Wu.

2426
01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.120
I'm sure it's Daniel.

2427
01:28:07.519 --> 01:28:09.030
Daniel is the Angel, everyone.

2428
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:12.460
I'm sure 100 percent Daniel is the Angel.

2429
01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:15.799
I knew it from the beginning. I was sure...

2430
01:28:16.269 --> 01:28:17.670
Daniel is the Angel.

2431
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.139
If the Demon gets more votes, you can share the money at home.

2432
01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:23.210
No. No.

2433
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:25.580
You don't need to try it if they don't trust me.

2434
01:28:25.679 --> 01:28:28.610
You're all fooled by the Demon's servants.

2435
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:31.650
I have nothing more to say. I know Daniel.

2436
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:34.080
I trust people easily.

2437
01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.150
I think we've never had so many people who trust so easily.

2438
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:39.620
- I know. - Me too.

2439
01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.759
- I can't write it. - From the bottom of my heart.

2440
01:28:42.929 --> 01:28:44.629
You're all going to regret.

2441
01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:45.929
I'll trust you.

2442
01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.500
- Me too. I'll trust you. - Key.

2443
01:28:48.729 --> 01:28:51.240
You should. I've been telling you.

2444
01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.639
If you believe it, the Demon can be an Angel.

2445
01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.139
SHINee's song "Lucifer" means demon.

2446
01:28:56.339 --> 01:28:58.280
I'm going to pick Ong Seong Wu.

2447
01:28:58.309 --> 01:28:59.740
I'll collect the votes.

2448
01:28:59.839 --> 01:29:01.009
It hurts my heart.

2449
01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.009
Let's reveal the prize box.

2450
01:29:03.009 --> 01:29:05.620
(Here comes the prize box.)

2451
01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.320
There's even a fog.

2452
01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.549
What is that?

2453
01:29:10.219 --> 01:29:13.059
I'll announce the person...

2454
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:14.990
who got the most vote.

2455
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:16.389
What if there's an unexpected twist?

2456
01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:18.299
I should've changed it.

2457
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:20.830
Let's please find the Angel this time.

2458
01:29:21.059 --> 01:29:22.530
Open up please.

2459
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:27.870
(Kang Daniel got the most votes.)

2460
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:30.110
You all trusted me.

2461
01:29:30.110 --> 01:29:32.009
- What? - What is that supposed to mean?

2462
01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.809
That explains everything.

2463
01:29:33.809 --> 01:29:35.750
Were you lying?

2464
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:37.150
- Really? - Daniel.

2465
01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:38.849
Are you a Demon?

2466
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:41.150
Please proceed to the Judgement Cabinet.

2467
01:29:41.519 --> 01:29:42.689
Is he the Angel?

2468
01:29:42.689 --> 01:29:44.089
(Daniel is going to win the prize regardless of who he is.)

2469
01:29:44.089 --> 01:29:47.290
If his key doesn't open it, it means he's not.

2470
01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:50.830
If he's the Demon, it will change to a red light.

2471
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:53.759
If he's the Angel, a green light will turn on.

2472
01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.830
- Now, - I think the red light will be on.

2473
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
please insert the key.

2474
01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:00.339
If it doesn't turn, it means he's not it.

2475
01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.769
Check the Master Key.

2476
01:30:03.769 --> 01:30:07.979
(He checks the key.)

2477
01:30:07.979 --> 01:30:10.250
(It turns.)

2478
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:12.580
Regardless of who he is, he's the Master Key.

2479
01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:15.120
- Is he the Angel? - No.

2480
01:30:15.219 --> 01:30:17.719
Let's say it together now.

2481
01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.019
- Are you a Demon or an Angel? - Are you a Demon or an Angel?

2482
01:30:20.059 --> 01:30:22.559
1, 2, 3.

2483
01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:29.400
(The owner of the Angel Master Key is Kang Daniel.)

2484
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.500
Daniel!

2485
01:30:31.299 --> 01:30:33.170
Daniel!

2486
01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:34.939
I really trusted him.

2487
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.269
Gosh.

2488
01:30:37.809 --> 01:30:38.979
Key!

2489
01:30:39.610 --> 01:30:41.410
I can't believe it.

2490
01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:43.080
I really trusted you.

2491
01:30:44.009 --> 01:30:45.979
(Is Key the owner of a Demon Master Key?)

2492
01:30:45.979 --> 01:30:46.979
He's a great actor.

2493
01:30:46.979 --> 01:30:48.490
I'm not going to listen to SHINee songs anymore.

2494
01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:51.189
Ladies and gentlemen. The vote was 6 to 6.

2495
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.389
- What? - I know.

2496
01:30:53.389 --> 01:30:55.889
Daniel received only half of the votes.

2497
01:30:56.759 --> 01:31:02.870
(We've forgotten something.)

2498
01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:07.040
(Because Daniel won Gold Chance Card,)

2499
01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:10.610
(Daniel's vote counts as 2.)

2500
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.280
He used that to win.

2501
01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.580
(Daniel wins by 1 vote.)

2502
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:18.580
(Summary of the Demon and the Angel)

2503
01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:20.120
(Your Key is the Angel's Master Key.)

2504
01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.620
Show us.

2505
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:23.049
I think I can guess it.

2506
01:31:23.049 --> 01:31:25.089
(Daniel is the owner of the Angel's Master Key.)

2507
01:31:25.089 --> 01:31:28.429
(Then what about Key?)

2508
01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.799
(Your Key is the Demon's Master Key.)

2509
01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.929
(Key is the owner of the Demon's Master Key.)

2510
01:31:37.269 --> 01:31:38.700
Hello. I'm the Angel.

2511
01:31:39.839 --> 01:31:43.939
(Daniel argued that he's the Angel from the beginning.)

2512
01:31:43.939 --> 01:31:47.379
(Key confirmed what Daniel is using the Key Guide.)

2513
01:31:48.150 --> 01:31:50.610
(Daniel is the Master Key.)

2514
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:55.189
(What did the Demon do after he found out who the Angel is?)

2515
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:58.320
(He persuaded people that he's the Angel.)

2516
01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.990
I checked Daniel, and it said yes.

2517
01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:03.929
Daniel is the one?

2518
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:05.960
Please trust me. I'm the Angel.

2519
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.099
What are you?

2520
01:32:08.269 --> 01:32:10.000
I'm telling you. I'm the Angel.

2521
01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.040
It looks like you're really sad.

2522
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.269
(However, Daniel's vote counts as 2.)

2523
01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:18.309
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

2524
01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.210
(The Angel and the voters receive the prize and 5 golden keys.)

2525
01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:23.509
Thank you.

2526
01:32:24.549 --> 01:32:25.620
Thank you.

2527
01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.620
Thank you.

2528
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.549
(It's always nice when you vote right.)

2529
01:32:29.549 --> 01:32:32.860
You could've got one if you trusted him.

2530
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.860
We got the key this time.

2531
01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:35.860
This is awesome.

2532
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.559
Try harder next week.

2533
01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.460
Let's work harder next week.

2534
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:43.000
- Sure. I'll see you next week. - Bye.

2535
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.969
(Daniel wins!)

2536
01:32:45.969 --> 01:32:47.339
