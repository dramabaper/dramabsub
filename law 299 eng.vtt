1
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.120
From the large lake to underground caves and a sinkhole,

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.260
Byung Man's Tribe concluded their survival in Atiu.

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.530
And the next location for survival...

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.960
with the new Byung Man's Tribe is Aitutaki.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.330
(Aitutaki)

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.300
It's been voted by explorers around the world...

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.930
as one of 1,001 sceneries to visit in your lifetime.

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.500
There are beautiful weathered volcanic rocks in Aitutaki.

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.740
3 volcanic islands and 12 coral islands...

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.880
form a triangle in this island.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.750
The white sand and the corals blend in with the turquoise sea,

12
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.150
so this place is called the last paradise on Earth.

13
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.150
(It's the last paradise on Earth.)

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.590
The Law of Jungle in Cook Islands unfolds in the paradise.

15
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.890
The second half starts now.

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.030
(On a sunny day in Aitutaki Airport, Cook Islands)

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.770
(Byung Man and Kang Nam await the new Tribe members.)

18
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.870
This is nice.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.340
Is that them?

20
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.540
(The plane cuts across the blue sky...)

21
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.450
(and arrives in Aitutaki Island.)

22
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.830
(The Tribe takes their first step towards a new challenge.)

23
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.100
Hello.

24
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660
Welcome to Aitutaki.

25
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.830
(The 34th Tribe took 34 hours to get here.)

26
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.240
Welcome to Aitutaki.

27
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.870
It was difficult to get here, right?

28
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.870
(You've come a long way.)

29
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.310
It was fun.

30
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.580
- Jung Tae. - Hello.

31
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.640
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

32
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.150
- Hello. - Joon Young.

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.210
It's your third time.

34
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.950
Hello, I'm Actor Kim Jung Tae.

35
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.050
(On TV and films,)

36
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.120
(he played unique roles with flawless acting.)

37
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.760
(He's a scene stealer who also took over variety shows.)

38
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.830
I'm not too worried.

39
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.570
Depending on the environment,

40
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.070
people adapt.

41
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.310
(As he said,)

42
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.610
(he starts surviving according to the environment.)

43
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.610
Give it to me.

44
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.950
(He conquers the rough sea with his surviving instincts.)

45
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.660
(He runs out of energy quickly too.)

46
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.990
That was unexpected.

47
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.700
(Unlike Jung Tae,)

48
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.870
(there's somebody who's full of energy.)

49
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.570
You need the fishing line, right?

50
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.240
(If somebody needs something,)

51
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.540
(she runs with her long legs.)

52
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.710
(Survival comes before the show.)

53
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.310
- Be careful. - Where?

54
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.580
(Who is this person who runs off without the camera?)

55
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.190
Hello, I'm Actress Lee Da Hee.

56
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.360
(She captivated the audience...)

57
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.960
(with her proud, chic, and sexy charms.)

58
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.100
NCO Recruit Lee Da Hee, mark!

59
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.300
(She conquered the military show,)

60
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.140
(and she's here to challenge herself in the survival.)

61
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.340
The other way.

62
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.580
(She's a perfect fit for the extreme nature of this show.)

63
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.550
(As a former model,)

64
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.980
(she has long legs, and she's proficient in underwater swimming.)

65
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.790
Did you receive training before coming here?

66
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.820
Pardon?

67
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.760
I'm so shy.

68
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.830
It's been a while. I'm Actor Park Jung Chul.

69
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.530
I went to Madagascar, Nepal, Costa Rica,

70
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.540
Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, and the Ecuadorian Amazon.

71
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.870
It was Chatham.

72
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.470
I've gone from the sea to the mountain. Isn't that everything?

73
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.470
(He's a veteran who's in the jungle for the 8th time.)

74
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.040
It's been 50 days since my baby was born.

75
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.380
I'm spending most days at home.

76
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.520
It's a parenting war.

77
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.650
I told people I'm going to the jungle,

78
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.260
and they think I'm avoiding my parenting responsibilities.

79
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.860
I think it's also good for my baby...

80
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.630
if I return home with good energy.

81
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.500
(Jung Joon Young's 3rd time, Niel's 2nd time)

82
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.240
(Byung Chan of Victon is the youngest.)

83
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.740
(The 34th Byung Man's Tribe is ready to go.)

84
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.380
All right. We have to take a boat, right?

85
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.150
- That's what it looks like, right? - Yes, that's what it looks like.

86
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.550
We are not going to the mountains.

87
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.350
- Right. - Should we divide ourselves?

88
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.290
- I think so. - Let's do that.

89
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.460
This survival begins...

90
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.990
as you leave the main island on the boat.

91
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.130
There are two boats behind you,

92
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.300
so please feel free to go on either one.

93
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.600
It's up to us?

94
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.770
- It's up to us? - Yes.

95
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.870
Let's go.

96
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.570
Let's get going.

97
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.970
- Should we go? - Let's go.

98
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040
What?

99
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.110
(What are you doing, Byung Chan?)

100
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.710
- What is it? - I...

101
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.980
- got something for the Chief. - It must be something.

102
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.010
What?

103
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.720
It's for the Chief.

104
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.720
I have something for everybody else too.

105
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.120
This is the best thing with idol members.

106
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.220
They always bring something.

107
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.420
They always bring interesting items.

108
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.990
Take that out.

109
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.290
This is it.

110
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.860
It was on the bottom.

111
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.430
- It's a letter. - It's from Ha Young.

112
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.230
She wrote you a letter.

113
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.470
- Ha Young did? - Yes.

114
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.940
- She wrote it herself. - Really?

115
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.140
- She really wrote this? - Yes.

116
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.340
Why did she write you a letter?

117
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.340
Read it out loud.

118
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.740
"Hello, Chief Byung Man and the members."

119
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.750
"Victon is in the same agency as us Apink."

120
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.850
"I heard that Byung Chan is going to the jungle,"

121
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.690
"so I thought Apink raincoats would be helpful..."

122
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.930
- "when you build houses." - It was so helpful.

123
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.830
"I wanted to help, so I sent them through Byung Chan."

124
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.270
"Please take care and don't overexert yourselves."

125
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.530
"From Ha Young of Apink."

126
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.570
(Ha Young's gift will be very practical for the Tribe.)

127
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.000
It's pretty useful.

128
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.310
- Yes. - Right?

129
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.480
We used Apink raincoats in Fiji last time.

130
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.980
- Really? - Are these the same ones?

131
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.880
- It's the same one. - It's for everybody?

132
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.350
- Yes. - It is the same one.

133
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.650
Here you go.

134
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.880
Does Apink sell raincoats?

135
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.220
- It's from our agency. - This raincoat?

136
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.250
It's a promotion.

137
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.460
It gets cold when it rains at night.

138
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.190
- We'll put these to good use. - Thank you.

139
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.730
- Thank you. - Don't worry.

140
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.760
- Let's go. - Let's go.

141
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.800
- We're leaving. - Come this way.

142
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.630
Go here.

143
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.070
(It's up to us.)

144
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.470
- Is it that important? - Pardon?

145
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.500
(They get on the boats.)

146
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.770
Are you going here?

147
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.440
- We'll go like this. - Sure.

148
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.380
- It doesn't matter, right? - No.

149
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.480
Which way are we going?

150
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.880
I'll go on first.

151
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.720
(Byung Man, Da Hee, Jung Chul, Niel, and Byung Chan in a big boat)

152
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.450
- Get on, Niel. - Okay.

153
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.550
Go on.

154
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.950
You can go first.

155
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.790
Go slowly.

156
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.090
(Jung Tae, Kang Nam, and Joon Young are in the small boat.)

157
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.290
We're good to go.

158
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.030
(Byung Man's Tribe is ready to go.)

159
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.530
See you.

160
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.470
(See you soon.)

161
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.700
Let's go.

162
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.480
(They sail across the emerald sea to their survival zone.)

163
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.080
Look at the color of the water.

164
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.550
- The color gets prettier. - This is unbelievable.

165
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.920
(They're amazed by the beautiful scenery.)

166
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.720
- This is an art. - It looks like computer graphics.

167
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.560
- Right. - It's beautiful.

168
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.820
I've never seen this color of water.

169
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.590
It's kind of white too.

170
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.530
It's so pretty.

171
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.870
Look at the color of the water. It's pretty.

172
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.600
- How many meters is this? - I wonder.

173
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.440
The color doesn't look real.

174
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.310
Right? It's so pretty.

175
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.840
It looks like the color of soda.

176
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.580
It's beautiful.

177
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.510
The water is so pretty.

178
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.280
This place looks like Hawaii.

179
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.150
Look at the color of the water.

180
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.350
Look.

181
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.490
- This... - The color...

182
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.090
(They can't take their eyes off from the water.)

183
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.100
Hey.

184
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.260
(They sail alongside each other and enjoy the nature.)

185
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.900
Hey! This looks like computer graphics.

186
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.970
It doesn't look real.

187
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.540
- Isn't this fake? - It looks like soda color.

188
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.670
The color is so pretty.

189
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.610
- It's so pretty. - I want to drink it.

190
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.110
- The color is so nice. - It's so pretty.

191
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.550
Is this the color of the water...

192
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.390
- or the corals inside? - No.

193
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.290
As you get deeper,

194
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.330
the water gets darker.

195
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.500
But it's not like the seas in Korea, right?

196
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.930
It's not as dark.

197
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.670
It's not totally dark. You can still see...

198
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.670
Do you fish in specific water?

199
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.770
Are most fish here edible?

200
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.080
Is it okay when you're catching them? They don't bite?

201
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.380
If you avoid them, they don't attack, right?

202
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.550
They won't just attack you.

203
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.120
Sea snakes are gentle.

204
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.150
When do we get to go in the water?

205
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.190
Have you learned to snorkel?

206
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.160
- Yes. - I'll guide you.

207
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.330
- Okay. - You can try.

208
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.930
- You know what? - What?

209
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.500
You can drink...

210
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.760
clear water like this.

211
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.100
I have something.

212
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.170
What is it?

213
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.430
(He takes care of his skin.)

214
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.200
It's a toner.

215
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.210
It brightens your skin.

216
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.880
The sun is strong, so you have to put something on.

217
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.340
True.

218
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.510
It's not about getting burnt. There's the volcano.

219
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.580
- The volcano. - That's true.

220
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.180
It's strong. Use a lot.

221
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.320
It's for everybody.

222
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.790
This is good.

223
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.460
You're too white.

224
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.230
I used what he gave me.

225
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.470
- I used everything he gave me. - It's too much.

226
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.670
Aren't you an actor?

227
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.070
Stop trying to be funny.

228
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.170
I used everything he gave me.

229
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.410
He was being thoughtful. I don't know how I look.

230
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.110
It's the Kabuki style.

231
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.110
I'm trying to rub it.

232
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.580
- Is it that bad? - I'm trying,

233
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.620
- but it's not getting absorbed. - You have to wipe it.

234
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.920
Put on a play.

235
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.250
(The members on this boat are getting ready to survive.)

236
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.690
Do it.

237
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.190
The color is beautiful.

238
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.220
It's getting prettier.

239
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.960
(They're absorbed in the Mother Nature.)

240
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.200
- When you look from above... - This is fantastic.

241
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.730
It is.

242
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.030
Director,

243
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.640
when this scene airs on the television...

244
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.340
(He sounds old.)

245
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.540
I haven't heard "television" in a while.

246
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.680
Can you play "Yeonan Pier" by Kim Trio?

247
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:40.480
(The boat comes by once in a while)

248
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.450
You didn't drink, right?

249
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.450
(Did you have a glass of rice wine?)

250
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.720
(He's mesmerized by the scenery.)

251
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.660
This is wonderful.

252
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.790
I think we're almost here.

253
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.130
- Cut the song. - We're here.

254
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.830
Our boat is going towards that island.

255
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.940
It's pretty.

256
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.870
- We're here. - It's pretty big.

257
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.780
(What will their survival zone be like?)

258
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.410
Is it the big island? Are we headed there?

259
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.210
Is it the big island?

260
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.850
It's so pretty.

261
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.660
- Is this it? - It's unbelievable.

262
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.760
- It's pretty. - Look at that.

263
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
- Are those all coconuts? - Yes.

264
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.170
We won't starve to death.

265
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.900
(Byung Man's Tribe is motivated from the beginning.)

266
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.240
- We're totally free here. - That's right.

267
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.410
Free?

268
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.680
- I'll show you how it's done. - It's really pretty.

269
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.280
It's pretty.

270
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.220
(Kang Nam's boat gets anchored first.)

271
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.690
What if...

272
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.950
(The others wait on their boat.)

273
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.620
Look at the waves.

274
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.660
This island is pretty.

275
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:57.990
- It's so nice. - It's small.

276
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.030
This is perfect for a commercial. I'm not ready.

277
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.030
It's a paradise. It's so nice.

278
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.240
- This is paradise. - Exactly.

279
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.810
(Byung Man scans the island from the boat.)

280
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.210
These rocks...

281
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.720
are from volcanic eruptions.

282
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.250
- These are volcanic rocks. - Right.

283
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.320
(Why is the other boat leaving?)

284
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320
- Look at them. - Where are you going?

285
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.020
(Byung Man's boat leaves the survival zone.)

286
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.090
Where are you going?

287
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.060
(Byung Man's boat leaves the survival zone.)

288
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.600
(What's going on?)

289
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.800
- Aren't we going there? - Why not?

290
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.670
(They're confused.)

291
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.340
- What? - Hey!

292
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.680
(They call out.)

293
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680
What?

294
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.850
(The boat sails farther away.)

295
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.850
Why?

296
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.520
I guess we're going to the island next to it.

297
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.420
- What's the idea? - What's this? Where is this going?

298
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.460
(They have a bad feeling.)

299
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.690
We're getting separated?

300
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.830
Why are they leaving? Why aren't you telling us?

301
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.430
As soon as you got on the boat,

302
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.740
the upcoming 48 hours were decided.

303
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.910
The upcoming 48 hours were decided.

304
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.040
We'll keep the same members...

305
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.910
For 48 hours, you have to survive together.

306
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.980
Here's the survival theme of Aitutaki Island.

307
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.680
They must survive separately for 48 hours.

308
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.550
- Let's go. - Let's go.

309
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.320
Before leaving, Byung Man's Tribe...

310
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.320
got on the two boats randomly.

311
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.220
As soon as they got on the respective boats,

312
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.660
their fates for 48 hours were decided.

313
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.860
From now on, they'll be divided into two islands...

314
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.630
of 5 and 3 people and will start their survival.

315
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.070
It's hard enough to try to survive together.

316
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.410
Will they be okay in small groups?

317
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.810
- Hold on. - I got on the wrong boat.

318
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.880
(They regret it. Their future is bleak.)

319
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.280
I should have gotten on the other one.

320
00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.650
- Seriously, what's going on? - Wait. Don't these islands connect?

321
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.750
I knew I got on the wrong one.

322
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.460
It was totally random.

323
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.630
Why did I get on the boat without Byung Man?

324
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.460
I regret it.

325
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.500
Is this for real?

326
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.500
(They're confused as well.)

327
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.730
- Really? - Are we doing this?

328
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.770
- For two days? - Yes.

329
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.370
I was more worried about Kang Nam's side than ours.

330
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.270
There were five of us,

331
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.510
but they only had three.

332
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.650
Are we going to be separated for 48 hours?

333
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.720
(They're at a loss.)

334
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.350
What? What is this?

335
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.890
48 hours is more than half of the trip.

336
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.220
- Really? - The three of them?

337
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.360
And us?

338
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.130
(They're more serious.)

339
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.530
Wait. Don't these islands connect?

340
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.900
(They're only 800m apart, but the water is in the way.)

341
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.600
- Once the tide is low? - We can swim there.

342
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.440
- We can't have crayfish then. - What? By ourselves?

343
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.510
(They're worried about the meal.)

344
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.270
How are we supposed to survive?

345
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.210
I haven't been here in a while, and this is the worst.

346
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:06.010
(Can they survive without the Chief?)

347
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.120
The color changed. It's different from earlier.

348
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.490
I can see the bottom. Right?

349
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.790
- It's different. - Look.

350
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.820
(He scans the area before getting off.)

351
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.130
The coconuts are too high.

352
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.690
- That's true. - They're too high.

353
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.730
There's a lower one.

354
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.660
That one?

355
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.170
They arrive on the two islands with the goal of...

356
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.770
surviving separately for 48 hours.

357
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.840
How will they survive on the two islands...

358
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.940
that look close but far.

359
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.080
(Niel is the first one to get off the boat on Byung Man's side.)

360
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.080
- Hold on, Niel. - Yes.

361
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.550
- Did you take it? - What?

362
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.620
Excuse me.

363
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.290
- Oh, this? - Yes.

364
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.420
- This... - Don't go too fast.

365
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.890
I'm going to drop it.

366
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.460
- You have to take care of me. - I know.

367
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.460
- That's good. - Okay.

368
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.030
I didn't get my shoes wet.

369
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.210
(Byung Chan gets off next.)

370
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.470
Da Hee, can you take my bag and jacket?

371
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.580
Okay.

372
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.980
(He takes care of Jung Chul.)

373
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.950
You're taking care of an old guy. You're giving me a piggyback,

374
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.280
so I might get criticized.

375
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.420
It's comfortable though.

376
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.090
Thank you.

377
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.260
(He piggybacks Da Hee as well.)

378
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.600
Byung Chan is a man.

379
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.660
(Byung Chan is a real man.)

380
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.070
- Thank you. - Thank you.

381
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.100
- I'll take your bag. - It's okay.

382
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.100
You're the best.

383
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.740
Let's get there first.

384
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.270
Are we going to be here for two days?

385
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.810
The most important thing is to look for a site for our shelter.

386
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.350
That's right. Let's take a tour of the island.

387
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.350
I think it'll take 9 minutes and 8 seconds.

388
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.250
- 9 minutes and 8 seconds? - The island is really small.

389
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.420
I like how small the island was.

390
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.790
Compared to big islands, smaller islands...

391
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.490
have less bugs,

392
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.490
and it's airy.

393
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.560
(It's a small island that feels pleasant.)

394
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.260
When we first got there, the sun was really strong,

395
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.770
so I really liked it.

396
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.400
The weather was great,

397
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.800
so it was pretty.

398
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.970
The sand portion was long,

399
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.110
and there was the forest.

400
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.380
It felt like there will be a lot of food,

401
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.710
and it looked like a good place to be in.

402
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.780
The fact that I was in the same team...

403
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.390
as Byung Man took all my worries away.

404
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.290
I didn't think it'll be hard.

405
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.260
We've never been separated from the first day.

406
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.320
The first thing...

407
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.690
that popped up in my head was that I'll have to work hard.

408
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.730
Let's leave our bags here...

409
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.960
and look around.

410
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.030
Let's look around.

411
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.570
Hey, look.

412
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.440
- They have that. - What is that?

413
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.710
It's a table.

414
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.840
There's a table.

415
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.580
Areas like these...

416
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.410
They have this in Belize.

417
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.450
During certain seasons, fishermen come...

418
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.720
and leave after they're done.

419
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.890
They come during seasons to catch fish.

420
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.550
That's what that is.

421
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.690
That's why the trees are cut.

422
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.760
(Locals rest or stay here after fishing in the area.)

423
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.290
That's right. It's a perfect size.

424
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.500
- Shall we go that way? - Okay.

425
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.400
The island you see in front of you...

426
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.670
is the island Kang Nam and the other two are at.

427
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.970
- That island? - Yes.

428
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.870
(They can clearly see it.)

429
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.780
- Are we going to see them? - We'll see them on the last day.

430
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.210
- 48 hours is 2 days. - We'll meet on the 3rd day.

431
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.410
- We'll meet on the 3rd day. - Right.

432
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.550
Can we swim there? Can't we do that?

433
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.620
If you'd like, you can.

434
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.350
You're saying we can swim there, right?

435
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.390
Yes.

436
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.690
- She's saying it's possible. - She's so strong.

437
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.890
It's different once you put the flippers on.

438
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.760
This is nice.

439
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.200
We can...

440
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.800
- use this as a table. - We can.

441
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.440
That's true. People stayed here temporarily.

442
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.840
There's another one.

443
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840
(There's a pillar made out of palm tree as well.)

444
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.410
We can use the pillar.

445
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.510
(They have all the ingredients to build a jungle house.)

446
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.050
I have to map it out in my head...

447
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.220
so that I know how to use the ingredients.

448
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.620
I'll think of a plan,

449
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.290
so you can partner up and take a tour.

450
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.960
If there's somewhere you can go in, try it.

451
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.460
- Take a full tour. - Okay.

452
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.960
Shouldn't we take tools?

453
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.830
Tools? What do we have?

454
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.500
- I think we should take them. - Okay.

455
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.540
(She opens up her backpack.)

456
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.210
Da Hee is the most prepared.

457
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.470
She has good tools.

458
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.640
Hold on. What's this?

459
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.580
Before I came here, I bought all these.

460
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.420
If I try to take professional tools,

461
00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.490
you might stop me,

462
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.260
so I took items that are used daily.

463
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.390
For example, I can use mesh laundry bags as nets.

464
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.430
I thought long and hard about what to bring.

465
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.800
We have to catch fish,

466
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.440
so I prepared mesh laundry bags to use as nets.

467
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.270
I don't like bugs,

468
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.110
so when I sleep,

469
00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.510
I can put it over my head.

470
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.350
Byung Man can use these skewers...

471
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.380
as harpoons when he goes night hunting.

472
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.180
Do you want to come?

473
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.020
I put a sticker on him.

474
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.260
The Law of Jungle.

475
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.060
I brought this. It was so memorable.

476
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.100
I brought wires to make a grill.

477
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.670
(She's the best.)

478
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.500
We have to catch fish.

479
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.940
I'll catch fish at all cost.

480
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.340
All right.

481
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.040
(Wire, string, nails, hammer, plier, and so on)

482
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.210
Da Hee brought everything.

483
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.280
- Gloves. - This is a hardware store.

484
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.080
Gloves.

485
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.680
- A grater? - Last time,

486
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.920
you grated coconut.

487
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.060
You made holes in a canteen, but you're not in a good condition,

488
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.420
so this is for you.

489
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.520
- Really? - Yes.

490
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.860
I have to climb and get coconuts then.

491
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.530
- Right? - It's a gift for your return.

492
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.060
This is awesome.

493
00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.840
She really wanted to be here.

494
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.640
She prepared a lot.

495
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.880
Even men don't prepare that much.

496
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.280
The fact that she brought survival tools...

497
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.080
was impressive.

498
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.280
You prepared so much. You're so detailed.

499
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.280
You're so detailed.

500
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.790
Next, Niel.

501
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.290
(Show me what you brought.)

502
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.360
(Me?)

503
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.760
(They saw what Da Hee brought.)

504
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.030
What did you bring?

505
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.500
I didn't bring anything special.

506
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.630
Just this.

507
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.800
(He brought a finger heart.)

508
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.410
(This is how I consider you.)

509
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.570
Is this what you brought?

510
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.280
Keep it in a safe place. Take it back.

511
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.350
Okay.

512
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.410
- I'll put it back. - Jung Chul.

513
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.250
It's down here.

514
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.750
It's big.

515
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.290
(He makes a heart with both hands.)

516
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.620
- It's big. - It is.

517
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.720
You got a big one.

518
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.720
- What about you? - Byung Chan.

519
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.290
It's in my bag.

520
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.490
- Your bag? - Good.

521
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.600
This is not free.

522
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.030
(It's a heart.)

523
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.100
It's the biggest.

524
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.570
Cut it up. Let's use it for hunting.

525
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.340
- Cut it up. - Leave it that way.

526
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.670
- Leave it as it is. - Okay.

527
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:09.870
Put it back.

528
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.940
(Team Byung Man has more love than tools.)

529
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.340
Imagine if Da Hee wasn't on our side.

530
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.710
- She saved us. - Thank you.

531
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.780
- I knew it. - Thank you.

532
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.480
- It's nothing. - It's Never Da Hee.

533
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.650
We won't die because of this.

534
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.020
(We won't die because we have Da Hee.)

535
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.520
- That's her nickname. - Okay.

536
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.290
- Look around. - Okay. See you later.

537
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.490
(Team Byung Man explores around.)

538
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.460
Look in the water too.

539
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.130
There might be clams.

540
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.100
- Take a full loop. - Okay.

541
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.400
They're there.

542
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.530
- Who is? - Don't you see them?

543
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.740
The other team?

544
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.910
- Is Jung Tae there? - Yes.

545
00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:44.910
(They can see the other members far away.)

546
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.010
They look close,

547
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.780
but if we try to swim over, it'll take a long time.

548
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.320
It looks close.

549
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720
(The two islands are 800m apart.)

550
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.750
It'll take longer than you think. The current is strong.

551
00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.920
(It won't be easy because of the waves.)

552
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.450
It's hard. It looks hard.

553
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.890
(They turn away from the other members...)

554
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.130
(and focus on searching nearby.)

555
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.570
- My gosh. - Why? My gosh, gloves.

556
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.170
(It's a moray eel.)

557
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.500
- No. - Can't we catch it?

558
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.210
We can catch it.

559
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.670
- I saw it last time. - We can catch it,

560
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.040
- but it doesn't taste good. - It has many bones, right?

561
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.480
- It's a moray eel. - Hey.

562
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.950
- It's a moray eel. - You're incredible.

563
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.120
I couldn't remember the name,

564
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.920
so I was just pointing at it. You're incredible.

565
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.420
It's hard to catch, and it tastes bad.

566
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.920
- It tastes bad, and it's bony. - Yes, it has many bones.

567
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.590
- What is it? - It's a net.

568
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.930
- Where? - Here.

569
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.430
There's a net.

570
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.930
We can use that later, right?

571
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.170
Right. We can use anything that's here.

572
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.000
Let's just remember where it is.

573
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.300
You see the rocky areas?

574
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.740
- The rocks. In between the rocks. - Right.

575
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.540
There are fish in these areas.

576
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.680
Jung Chul, isn't this a fish?

577
00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.450
- Where? - Jung Chul.

578
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.550
(Did she find a fish?)

579
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.720
- This one. The one on the bottom. - Where?

580
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.860
- It looks weird. - Where?

581
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.290
The one on the bottom.

582
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.590
Look at the tail. It's moving.

583
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.890
It's not a fish.

584
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.660
Isn't it a sea cucumber?

585
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.500
There's a conch.

586
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.470
Hold on. That's not important right now.

587
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.170
We'll miss this one then.

588
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.640
I know, but this is a sea cucumber.

589
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.410
It's not a sea cucumber. It's a fish.

590
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.510
It's not.

591
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.380
I'm sure.

592
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.210
- Didn't you bring that? - It's not.

593
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.280
Did you bring the skewer?

594
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.950
This is my eighth time here.

595
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.850
- I brought it. - It's not a fish.

596
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.950
You picked them up. I just brought them.

597
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.390
Which one?

598
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.990
The skewer. We can use it as a harpoon.

599
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.090
I thought you took everything we needed.

600
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.190
I only brought this.

601
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.900
- I packed these. - I know.

602
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.560
- What about you? - We each had to bring it?

603
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.470
I didn't bring anything.

604
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:51.770
(I came empty-handed.)

605
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.140
I didn't bring anything.

606
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.000
We're just exploring.

607
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.670
I see the conch.

608
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.910
It's not a fish. I'm serious.

609
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.480
You're wrong. It is a fish.

610
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.810
Go towards it.

611
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.950
Try it then.

612
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.520
- It looks gross. - It's trial and error.

613
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.050
Jung Chul, do you want to try it?

614
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.220
What? Do you want me to take it out?

615
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.360
Yes.

616
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.760
Can you do it?

617
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.760
I thought you were confident.

618
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.030
I saw it move.

619
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.100
(Jung Chul takes over.)

620
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.930
Is it a snake?

621
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.270
It's not moving.

622
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.110
(What are you?)

623
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.110
Is it moving?

624
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.480
It's defending itself.

625
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.480
(It spurts out white liquid.)

626
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480
It's spurting out.

627
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.250
(Oh, my)

628
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.750
See?

629
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.790
- This... - Good job moving it.

630
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.020
(She's scared,)

631
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.090
(but she doesn't forget to praise him.)

632
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.490
- Can you move it up more? - Thanks for your compliment.

633
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.330
- A little bit more. - Should I move it up more?

634
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.100
- Yes. - Okay.

635
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.400
She was making me do it.

636
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.170
I didn't feel bad.

637
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.100
She was very enthusiastic.

638
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.000
She wanted to help.

639
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.670
She tried to participate.

640
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.080
I was thankful.

641
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.350
I have seen something like this.

642
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.510
It has a name.

643
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.850
- It isn't fish. - I told you it isn't fish.

644
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.950
Fish doesn't look like that.

645
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.720
Go in.

646
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.820
- There is a conch. - I told you earlier.

647
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.030
There is a big one.

648
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.200
- I told you. - There is another one.

649
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200
I told you.

650
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.770
Take off the stone and put it here.

651
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:32.770
There is another one.

652
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.000
There are no small ones.

653
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.240
- Okay. - There are many of them.

654
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.380
(She becomes absorbed in collecting conchs.)

655
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.810
Collect a few of them.

656
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.210
- Is this edible? - It's edible.

657
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.380
(Taking off)

658
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.220
It's tasty when it's grilled.

659
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.490
- It's a conch. - A conch?

660
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.660
There are clams too.

661
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.090
Let's take them.

662
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.360
- Give them to me. - Are they too small?

663
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.460
Give them to me.

664
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.930
- Feel them. - I don't need to.

665
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.230
There is no flesh.

666
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.330
The shells opened.

667
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.730
(He has nothing to say.)

668
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:05.770
My goodness.

669
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.270
Do you want to carry it?

670
00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.470
- The bag? - Yes.

671
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.670
Okay. I will carry it.

672
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:12.770
(She makes a bag for the jungle.)

673
00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.880
There are plenty to eat.

674
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.980
We should catch fish.

675
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.250
We should.

676
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.780
We will probably go on a hunt after sunset.

677
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.420
It's not strong on the details,

678
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.920
but I need to collect conchs.

679
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.660
- Do what you can do. - Carry it.

680
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.230
Just make it possible for me to carry it.

681
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.200
Make it a cross body bag.

682
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.030
You can zip and unzip.

683
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.030
(Da Hee makes use of the laundry bag.)

684
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.670
We don't have much time.

685
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.570
- We need to move fast. - It's okay.

686
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.370
Relax.

687
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.480
Survival doesn't get easier.

688
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.950
Relax even if you are in a hurry.

689
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.580
There are too many of them.

690
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.180
- Let's go. - Okay.

691
00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.890
- Jung Chul. - We have enough.

692
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.050
Be careful.

693
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.720
- Are you okay? - Why do you ask?

694
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160
(Jung Chul looks for wounds.)

695
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.930
You aren't hurt, are you? You need to be careful.

696
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.700
- Step on the floor. - I am embarrassed. Stop talking.

697
00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.300
Okay.

698
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.500
Here.

699
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.340
(She collects conchs as if nothing happened.)

700
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.410
It's slippery. Don't step on the wet rocks.

701
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.840
Let's see what Chief Byung Man is doing.

702
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.350
It hurts.

703
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.350
(My tailbone hurts.)

704
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.780
Are we on our own?

705
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.790
(The three members are left in a different island.)

706
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.620
(Dazed)

707
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.390
(How will we live?)

708
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.660
(They are at a loss.)

709
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.160
(I am going back home.)

710
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.230
Hold on. Where are you going?

711
00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:44.570
Come on.

712
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:45.870
Where are you going?

713
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.740
He really tried to leave.

714
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.240
This is the worst scenario.

715
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240
(You said this place is the last paradise on Earth.)

716
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.340
Hold on. You must be good at things.

717
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.310
I can't do anything without Byung Man.

718
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.750
- We have no time to complain. - Okay.

719
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.350
Let's unpack and get ready.

720
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.290
- You are optimistic. - Why are you so optimistic?

721
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.990
- What? - Why are you so optimistic?

722
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.860
I am a married man.

723
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.560
Are you optimistic because you are married?

724
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.760
That's convincing.

725
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.060
Let's go over there.

726
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.700
Then we should decide...

727
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:22.640
which place will be our base camp.

728
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:23.970
It can be here.

729
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.570
- What? - This place is good.

730
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.980
This island is small.

731
00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.740
Water probably flows underneath.

732
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880
Shall we go around the island?

733
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.880
Let's put our luggage here and explore the island.

734
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.150
- Wouldn't it be better? - Shall we go around the island?

735
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.290
Let's put our luggage here and explore the island.

736
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.160
- It will be a walk. - Shall we do that?

737
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.020
Shall we meet back here?

738
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.660
What? Should we go separately?

739
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.230
You won't have enough screen time unless you go with me.

740
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.460
All right.

741
00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.470
Bye.

742
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.770
(The exploration starts.)

743
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.070
It's hard to go into the forest, right?

744
00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.970
(Right next to the beach is a dense jungle.)

745
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.970
I can hear the birds.

746
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.110
There is an orangutan.

747
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.110
- Really? - Yes.

748
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.680
(What?)

749
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.110
Will you keep telling these lies?

750
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.310
- What is this? - I have to tell them at first.

751
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.520
- You have to tell them at first. - Otherwise, I feel awkward.

752
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.420
All right.

753
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.690
Can you light up a fire?

754
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.690
- What? - Can you light up a fire?

755
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.190
You should light up your eyes.

756
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.860
- Let's go around the island. - Okay.

757
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.130
I am sorry that I can't react to all of your jokes.

758
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.830
I will react to 2 out of 3 jokes.

759
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.500
- I will react to 2 out of 3 jokes. - Joon Young.

760
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.100
- Yes? - Try to be more responsive.

761
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.040
We have only met.

762
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.470
As a fellow celebrity,

763
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.070
- you can be more understanding. - Of course.

764
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.380
Kang Nam, lead the way.

765
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.380
Okay.

766
00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.980
(With Kang Nam leading, they walk into the forest.)

767
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.380
(It's completely different from the beach.)

768
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.520
Kang Nam. What will we do without Byung Man?

769
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.720
We don't have a shelter. How will we build a shelter?

770
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.390
There will be mosquitoes.

771
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.260
There is no wind to chase them away. This is a disaster.

772
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.030
- I feel dizzy. - Hold on.

773
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.800
There is a bird.

774
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.970
Isn't it a parrot?

775
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.200
Why is it sitting down?

776
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.570
(It's a bird with white weathers and a dark beak.)

777
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.210
There is another one.

778
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.110
This one has a room on the second floor.

779
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.510
- It's pretty. - Isn't it more expensive?

780
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.150
- What do you mean? - Isn't this room more expensive?

781
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.620
The second floor is more expensive.

782
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.790
(White tern is well-known to live for many years.)

783
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.390
Its beak is blue.

784
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.960
(We have a nest. Do you have a shelter?)

785
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.860
(They cross the forest that is filled with birds...)

786
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.070
(and reach to the beach on the other side.)

787
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.830
- We reached the other side. - What?

788
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.970
We reached the other side.

789
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.840
(They travel far to find a place to build their shelter.)

790
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.870
Is this side better?

791
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.270
This side could be better.

792
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.740
The wind will keep the mosquitoes away.

793
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.310
If we sleep over there, the mosquitoes will bite us.

794
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.610
The water won't come up to here, will it?

795
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.680
If it's too windy,

796
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.680
- won't it get too cold? - What about the water?

797
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.790
The beach on the other side was wider.

798
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.490
- Let's walk around. - Shall we do that?

799
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:52.490
Let's walk around.

800
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.720
- Let's walk around some more. - This drives me crazy.

801
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.460
We were in the jungle, but it's different by the beach.

802
00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.900
There must be a volcano.

803
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200
A volcano.

804
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.370
(The topography is varied even though the island is small.)

805
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.370
(Is there something to eat?)

806
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.270
There are no clams.

807
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.970
(They can't even find clams.)

808
00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.750
Isn't that a giant clam?

809
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.580
Oh, it isn't. What is that?

810
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.850
Isn't that a giant clam?

811
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.960
(Sharp needles)

812
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.160
Isn't it a porcupine carcass?

813
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.990
I found a monster.

814
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.330
What? Is it an animal?

815
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.360
What is that?

816
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.100
Isn't it an ammonite fossil?

817
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.140
What is that?

818
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.670
(They take a closer look.)

819
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.670
Blowfish.

820
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.270
Blowfish.

821
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.080
- What's that? - Blowfish.

822
00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.680
What's that?

823
00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.650
- Blowfish. - It's poisonous.

824
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.450
- Blowfish. - Yes.

825
00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.320
- It's fish. - Yes.

826
00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.590
That's why it smells.

827
00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.760
- It's smelly. - It's smelly.

828
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.660
There is a crab. Is it alive?

829
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:06.230
I think it's dead.

830
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.360
(This one is dead too.)

831
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.900
It's dead. It's like a fossil.

832
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.030
(In this island,)

833
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.030
It's a crab.

834
00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:15.470
(nothing is alive.)

835
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.670
No way.

836
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.680
- Is it a shark? - It's so big.

837
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.740
(There is a giant fish bone.)

838
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.250
It will be nice to catch fish this big.

839
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.480
Isn't it a tuna?

840
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.580
(Why is it on the beach?)

841
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.790
- It must have been this big. - It's really big.

842
00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.090
(Without Chief Byung Man,)

843
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.660
(they feel a sense of fear.)

844
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.960
This drives me crazy.

845
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.830
There is nothing on this island.

846
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.330
What should we do?

847
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.270
There is nothing on this island.

848
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.270
(Will the three of them be able to survive?)

849
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.870
(Meanwhile, on the island with Chief Byung Man,)

850
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.280
(he is planning a jungle house on his own.)

851
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.380
It will get colder at night.

852
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.060
(An hour ago)

853
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.360
I went inside the forest.

854
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.730
There were sand flies and mosquitoes.

855
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.300
I smell chicken poop.

856
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.300
(Is there chicken here?)

857
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.440
That's why I decided to move to the beach.

858
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.380
(Build a shelter on the windy beach.)

859
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.380
(He is planning to build a shelter on the beach.)

860
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.520
I will focus on making it waterproof...

861
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.350
so that we don't get rained on.

862
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.830
(Byung Man figured out the environment upon arrival.)

863
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.100
Squalls can come suddenly.

864
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.140
(It's know-how that stems from experiences and knowledge.)

865
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:55.440
It rains mostly at night.

866
00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.310
That's why we need a roof.

867
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.410
Look over there.

868
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:06.480
(Build a roof over the shelter at a humid island.)

869
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:13.260
(He decided on the location and design.)

870
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.760
(Use materials from the environment.)

871
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.670
(He will use the remains of the resting place.)

872
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.370
Hurry up.

873
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.870
Hurry up.

874
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.470
Did you catch something?

875
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.610
(Jung Chul and Da Hee come back with conchs.)

876
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.810
Conchs.

877
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.180
- What? - We collected conchs.

878
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.410
Conchs?

879
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.580
(They have a lot of conchs.)

880
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.850
This is...

881
00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.320
- Did you find these? - There are a lot of them.

882
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.450
There were a lot of them in this size.

883
00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.990
We only collected a few.

884
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.390
Murex is very tasty.

885
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.660
- Is it tasty? - Yes.

886
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.260
I didn't think it would be tasty as there were so many of them.

887
00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.660
There were a lot of them.

888
00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.230
That's why you said you collected them.

889
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.360
- We collected them. - You collected them.

890
00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.470
That's right.

891
00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.970
My goodness.

892
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.370
We can collect these...

893
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.340
- and catch fish. - She wants fish.

894
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.840
Then let's store them...

895
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.550
somewhere else.

896
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.020
- Let's put them there. - There?

897
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.150
- You see the rocks, right? - Is that the storage?

898
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.120
Yes. Put them there.

899
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.650
- We could farm them. - Keep them in clear water.

900
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.560
We can have these for snacks.

901
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.830
(Da Hee stores what she collected.)

902
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.330
Keep them submerged in water.

903
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.500
(She can do it well on her own.)

904
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.910
(They now have food in the natural storage.)

905
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.410
Jung Chul, let's build a house.

906
00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.020
-You see the big logs, right? - Yes.

907
00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.020
We will put the thickest ones sideways.

908
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.720
- You will lay them down. - Two logs will enough.

909
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.090
- Then we will lay them like this. - Three logs.

910
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.860
There are two sheets plywood.

911
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.760
We can put them over the logs.

912
00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.630
- The roof will be triangular. - It will look like this.

913
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.230
It will keep the rain out.

914
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.300
- The end. - The end.

915
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.540
- Jung Chul. - Yes?

916
00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.340
(Byung Man hasn't recovered fully.)

917
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.210
- This one and this one. - We need all of them.

918
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.310
- Shall I take all of them? - Yes.

919
00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.240
(He moves the logs under Chief Byung Man's directions.)

920
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.340
Move them over there.

921
00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.410
(He moves the logs under Chief Byung Man's directions.)

922
00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.390
I lost the muscles I made in The Law of Jungle.

923
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.960
(Even for a veteran, the logs are heavy.)

924
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.060
(At that moment)

925
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.770
Da Hee, please take this one. Watch the nails.

926
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.500
This one.

927
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.840
(She carries it slowly at first.)

928
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.610
(Then she sprints.)

929
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.650
(Da Hee sprints across the beach.)

930
00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.850
(Running)

931
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.150
(Heave-ho)

932
00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.560
(She runs back as soon as she puts the log down.)

933
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.230
(Da Hee is an energetic woman who roams the jungle.)

934
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.900
(Da Hee never runs out of energy.)

935
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.800
You can put it in the middle.

936
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.640
(The veteran ran out of energy.)

937
00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.580
(Running)

938
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.420
(She is scary.)

939
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.620
(Cheerful)

940
00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.260
(Grabbing)

941
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.560
(Da Hee contributes a lot.)

942
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.730
We just need to bring the big log.

943
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.330
Is it over there?

944
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.930
- Yes. - The big one's heavy.

945
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.600
- I have you. - Let's carry it together.

946
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.870
(Let's carry the log together.)

947
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.470
I can't carry it alone.

948
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:52.840
It has been a while...

949
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.910
(He needs Da Hee's strength to carry the log.)

950
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.040
since I carried the log.

951
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040
(He needs Da Hee's strength to carry the log.)

952
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.180
(However, she organizes her backpack.)

953
00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.350
You have everything in your backpack.

954
00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.510
(However, she organizes her backpack.)

955
00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.150
It's a backpack of treasures.

956
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.490
(A rope?)

957
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.920
- Now... - You put it under the log.

958
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.190
(They put the rope under the log.)

959
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.430
- We can carry it like this. - You are smart.

960
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.790
All right.

961
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.930
It's much easier.

962
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.470
You are the brain of the team.

963
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.140
(Da Hee is strong and smart.)

964
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.310
You are so smart.

965
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.040
I am so impressed.

966
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.610
Da Hee, please bring an ax.

967
00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.450
Make a shape of V.

968
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.650
(Even for the veterans, axing isn't easy.)

969
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.720
You should try everything.

970
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.230
(She takes the ax with wide eyes.)

971
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:45.630
I trust you more than Jung Chul.

972
00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:48.630
I bet she can do it better than me.

973
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.630
That's right. Use the weight of the ax.

974
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:52.630
She knows how to use an ax.

975
00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.110
She has the know-how.

976
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.510
We should check how much Da Hee moves in a day.

977
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.780
We need to cut a furrow.

978
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.790
(She follows Byung Man's instructions.)

979
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.190
She has the know-how.

980
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.260
(1,000,001, 1,000,002)

981
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.390
(1,000,003)

982
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.860
That's enough. That's perfect.

983
00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.230
(She cut a furrow neatly.)

984
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.130
All right.

985
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.640
We need to dig a hole.

986
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.600
- The lower one. - This log.

987
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.670
(She picks up the tool...)

988
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:37.510
(and digs the earth without a word.)

989
00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.620
(Staring)

990
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.420
She is better than most men.

991
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.830
I saw her run around. She was incredibly active.

992
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.500
"She really wanted to be on The Law of Jungle."

993
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.070
(She moves endlessly despite the heat.)

994
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.040
It was hard to work because of the heat.

995
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.810
However, my body felt great despite the exhaustion.

996
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.940
I didn't think of it as a struggle.

997
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.550
(She is 100-percent suited for The Law of Jungle.)

998
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.620
(Thanks to Da Hee, the foundation is complete.)

999
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.320
- Don't you need a furrow there? - No.

1000
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.750
Why aren't they coming?

1001
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.750
(Where are the younger members?)

1002
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.160
(Coming soon)

1003
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.130
(In one island are careful plans for survival.)

1004
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.530
(In the other is a free-spirited survival.)

1005
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.850
(They haven't decided where to build a house.)

1006
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:36.950
We need to build a house.

1007
00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.770
(They circled the island.)

1008
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.910
(What should I do?)

1009
00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.680
There is nothing.

1010
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.990
(They go back to the starting point.)

1011
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.290
This place is nice.

1012
00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.930
- Where? - This place is nice.

1013
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.150
Look.

1014
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.080
- The grass tells us... - You are right.

1015
00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.650
- the water won't reach this far. - This place is nice.

1016
00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:04.390
We won't need a roof.

1017
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.490
(A coconut tree provides the shade.)

1018
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.490
Now, let's make this place our base camp.

1019
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.730
We can't sleep like this.

1020
00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.870
- What do you mean? - I mean...

1021
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.100
- It might rain. - That's right.

1022
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.370
We have raincoats.

1023
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.800
(We have Apink raincoats.)

1024
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.870
We can put them together.

1025
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.840
I have three raincoats.

1026
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.440
Let's put up the raincoats...

1027
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.550
with a rope.

1028
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.420
It will bump up the cost of the house.

1029
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.350
- We can use a rope. - This place isn't developed.

1030
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.950
- Is it cheap? - It's cheap.

1031
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:35.990
I see.

1032
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:39.190
The mountain and the sea create the perfect harmony.

1033
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.130
You always have a response.

1034
00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.330
That's right.

1035
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.860
You weren't a comedian, were you?

1036
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.360
- What? - You have always been an actor.

1037
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.000
- I was a resident of Busan. - A resident of Busan.

1038
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.140
(He makes a dad joke all the time.)

1039
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.570
Let's use the Pythagorean theorem.

1040
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.670
- Pythagoras? - What?

1041
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.170
- Why did you bring up Pythagoras? - It's a triangle.

1042
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.780
It's mathematics, right?

1043
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.840
X minus Y multiplied by X.

1044
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.050
- You are X. - Really?

1045
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.750
- You are X. - I like Y.

1046
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.450
My goodness.

1047
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.850
(They're really amazing.)

1048
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.950
- My goodness. - Do you know pi? 3.14.

1049
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.290
Do you know pi? 3.14.

1050
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.820
Walnut pie is the best.

1051
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.290
(I haven't struggled this much in The Law of Jungle.)

1052
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.330
Now...

1053
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.500
Let's build a big house.

1054
00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.870
- Let's make a triangle. - A triangle.

1055
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.340
Everyone,

1056
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.240
I brought this to repel mosquitoes.

1057
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.270
(He brought it from Korea to avoid the mosquitoes.)

1058
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.540
Thank you.

1059
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.440
(Jung Tae takes care of the younger members.)

1060
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.580
You must protect your legs too.

1061
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.710
Hold on.

1062
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.710
(I will spray it on myself.)

1063
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.620
(He sprays it like a middle-aged man.)

1064
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.050
It should go that way.

1065
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.390
You want to connect the middle.

1066
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.360
It will be the frame.

1067
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.430
(They make the frame by roping three trees.)

1068
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.930
We only need a roof over our heads.

1069
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.360
- Pull hard. - That's good.

1070
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.030
The rope is short. Leave it.

1071
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.170
- Should I leave it? - Yes.

1072
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.470
All right.

1073
00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.800
We can do everything with the rope.

1074
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.100
(They complete the frame with the rope.)

1075
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.410
(Will they use the coconut leaves?)

1076
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:04.710
(They put coconut leaves over the rope.)

1077
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.980
Let's go.

1078
00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.050
(They don't make a slope for the rain to fall.)

1079
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.980
We came up with a quick plan...

1080
00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.390
because we didn't want to work. We just needed a place to sleep.

1081
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:20.590
We worked with the same thought...

1082
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:23.330
in our minds.

1083
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.200
That's good.

1084
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.500
(They complete the roof in 15 minutes.)

1085
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.500
I will throw them to you.

1086
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.800
(They make a fireplace with coconut shells.)

1087
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.640
(A trunk that is rolled over...)

1088
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.710
It's a fireplace.

1089
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.010
(makes a table.)

1090
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.880
- Isn't it a fireplace? - It's a fireplace.

1091
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.010
It's a fireplace.

1092
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.580
(They forgo the flooring since dirt is good for health.)

1093
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.590
(So far it took 20 minutes.)

1094
00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:48.850
(Throwing)

1095
00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.220
(They build a shelter in the shortest time...)

1096
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.630
(in The Law of Jungle history.)

1097
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:54.760
Try lying down.

1098
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.860
It's cozier than you think.

1099
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.560
(They only worked for 20 minutes.)

1100
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.670
Nice.

1101
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:02.770
- It's nice. - Quite nice.

1102
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.240
We are a small team,

1103
00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.310
but the three of us...

1104
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.570
can win the other five.

1105
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.640
- We have a good teamwork. - Yes.

1106
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.280
What do you think?

1107
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280
- Jung Tae. - Yes?

1108
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:16.920
Isn't that chicken?

1109
00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.180
- Jung Tae. - Yes?

1110
00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.990
Isn't that chicken?

1111
00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.220
- We should catch it. - Gosh.

1112
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.920
Jung Tae, isn't that chicken?

1113
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.260
- Pick up a branch. - Should we hit them?

1114
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.660
Hurry. Pick up a branch.

1115
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.290
- Pick up a branch. - Jung Tae, isn't that chicken?

1116
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.130
(The Vice Chief is in a hunting mode.)

1117
00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.400
This is...

1118
00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.900
(It's a hunting zone, not a shelter zone!)

1119
00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.930
- There's chicken. - Chase them.

1120
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.100
Chase them toward the sea. Hurry up.

1121
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.840
Chase them toward the sea.

1122
00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.200
(They need to...)

1123
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.040
(drive the chicken toward the sea.)

1124
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.610
Why aren't these people moving?

1125
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:46.880
We said we'd take a five-minute break.

1126
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.980
- We have a minute left. - Still...

1127
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.680
- They're right there. - They won't go far.

1128
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.780
They don't have wings.

1129
00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.180
- Still... - They're angels without wings.

1130
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.250
They're right in front of us.

1131
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.390
We have no strength.

1132
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:56.720
Still, they're so close.

1133
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.190
We said we'd take a 5-minute break.

1134
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.890
Seriously? For real?

1135
00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.260
(Is this for real?)

1136
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.560
- They won't leave. - No.

1137
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.260
- Won't they? - No.

1138
00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.730
- Seriously? - Let's rest for five minutes.

1139
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.070
There are three of them right there.

1140
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.800
They won't go anywhere.

1141
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.100
Do you think so too?

1142
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.610
That's their house.

1143
00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.610
They're not seagulls. They're chickens.

1144
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:16.740
They won't go anywhere.

1145
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.710
We need to drive them toward the sea, no?

1146
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.280
(This has never happened before.)

1147
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.280
I was taken aback.

1148
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.520
They told me to sit down.

1149
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.420
We always ran when there was something.

1150
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.690
We even jumped in the water.

1151
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.120
(Cock-a-doodle-doo!)

1152
00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.330
(Whenever they heard a chicken crow,)

1153
00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.460
(they ran as fast as they could.)

1154
00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.900
Hey! Jump in the water and swim!

1155
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.130
(If we don't catch it, we'll starve.)

1156
00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.640
(Kang Nam even dived into dirty water.)

1157
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.440
Yes, there were chickens.

1158
00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.040
But what should I have done?

1159
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.780
I had no idea we had to catch them.

1160
00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.190
We were tired after...

1161
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:01.750
building a shelter.

1162
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.020
I thought they'd come back again.

1163
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.460
I told him let's wait.

1164
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.890
Kang Nam was funny.

1165
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:07.930
(Only Kang Nam was antsy.)

1166
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:10.800
I was flustered. I was shocked.

1167
00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.230
I haven't met free souls in a long time.

1168
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:16.870
What?

1169
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:19.440
Wait. This never happened before.

1170
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.410
We can catch them. They have nowhere to go.

1171
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.280
I've been in the jungle 10 times already,

1172
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.110
but I've never had a great chance like this.

1173
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.380
Seriously, I'm getting the chills.

1174
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.680
- You won't miss the chance. - I mean...

1175
00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.920
I'm running a simulation.

1176
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.550
- A simulation? - Let's say we catch them.

1177
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.050
What will we do after?

1178
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.660
Who will pluck all the feathers?

1179
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.490
The chickens are gone. I don't see them.

1180
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:40.530
(They're gone.)

1181
00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.290
- It's okay. - How will you pluck the feathers?

1182
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.000
We have to catch them first.

1183
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.700
Never mind. It's okay.

1184
00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.330
They have nowhere to go. They're bored.

1185
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.840
Really? That was a great chance though.

1186
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.570
(Byung Man,)

1187
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.410
Really?

1188
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.610
(I miss you.)

1189
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.780
- Guys. - Yes?

1190
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.980
- Let me tell you what I think. - Okay.

1191
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.680
- I already gave up. - First...

1192
00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:05.920
let's catch them.

1193
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.190
- The chickens? - Yes.

1194
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.490
(Let's catch them.)

1195
00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:09.520
- The chickens? - Yes.

1196
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.760
- We should've done that earlier. - No.

1197
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.230
They aren't in a hurry. We aren't in a hurry either.

1198
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.100
- We just need to eat dinner. - Is that right?

1199
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.430
Then how will you catch the chickens?

1200
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.430
Don't we need to beat them with this?

1201
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.900
We should've beaten them earlier.

1202
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.570
We should see what they do.

1203
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.210
What will you beat them with? Rock?

1204
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.210
I wasn't going to use any tools.

1205
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.480
(They set off to hunt.)

1206
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.350
- Let's go. - Wait. Let me practice.

1207
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:37.920
Why don't you...

1208
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.420
try crowing?

1209
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.250
Let's practice.

1210
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.590
(Ignoring)

1211
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:43.660
Joon Young.

1212
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.590
Joon Young.

1213
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.660
I'm talking to you.

1214
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.130
- Show us. - How are you doing it?

1215
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.130
(I can't mimic a chicken.)

1216
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.230
It's okay.

1217
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.100
(Clucking)

1218
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.770
(Goodness)

1219
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.210
(Poor Jung Tae.)

1220
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.510
I'm turning 50 soon. Should I really do this?

1221
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.280
You're great at it.

1222
00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.580
- Let's go. - He's an actor.

1223
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.650
He really is an actor.

1224
00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.010
He can act like a chicken.

1225
00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.820
(Will they succeed in catching chickens?)

1226
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:13.620
The youngest members, Niel and Byung Chan...

1227
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.220
also start exploring the island.

1228
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.720
What do we need to do when we explore an island?

1229
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:22.590
Based on my experience...

1230
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.760
Based on your experience...

1231
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.730
- I was an ace. - I see.

1232
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.130
- Because it's low tide... - What's in there?

1233
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.870
we need to see what's in the water.

1234
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.670
We should see if there are any coconuts hanging low.

1235
00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.210
Don't pick them?

1236
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.580
We do. We pick them if we can.

1237
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.380
You always have to look carefully.

1238
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.250
We might catch something unexpected.

1239
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.350
(Follow me!)

1240
00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.550
(Let's see.)

1241
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.790
Is this something you were talking about?

1242
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.830
I've never eaten a coconut.

1243
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:54.890
Me neither.

1244
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.330
Coconut oil...

1245
00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.630
I hear liquid.

1246
00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.970
- Should we try opening it? - Can we eat this?

1247
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.240
- It's gone bad though. - Has it gone bad?

1248
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.300
- Hasn't it? - But it doesn't smell.

1249
00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.410
- Let's take it. - Let's bring it with us.

1250
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.340
- It's just one. - Yes.

1251
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.480
Wait. What's this?

1252
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.210
Is there something?

1253
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.450
This.

1254
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.290
Isn't it a sea cucumber?

1255
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:24.060
We can't bring this. Let's just remember.

1256
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.090
We'll remember this.

1257
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.860
Just remember that there was a sea cucumber.

1258
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.430
Let's not go in there.

1259
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:31.630
(Stopping)

1260
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.630
- Because it's scary. - Yes.

1261
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:36.330
Just tell the others we found a place like this.

1262
00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.340
Yes.

1263
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.500
- Let's just remember it. - Okay.

1264
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.240
There's a coconut path.

1265
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.370
Yes.

1266
00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.740
Look at this.

1267
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.650
It's a fish.

1268
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.180
(They find a small fish.)

1269
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.050
Remember that. We have three things to remember.

1270
00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:53.420
Bring your mom.

1271
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.690
Let's remember this spot.

1272
00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:56.690
(Let's not forget the lesson from the experienced.)

1273
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.090
An advice from the experienced.

1274
00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:00.590
I will escort you, so don't worry.

1275
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.630
(They eagerly memorize everything.)

1276
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:02.690
Don't worry.

1277
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.430
If we go this way...

1278
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.900
There's a crab!

1279
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.030
- On the rock! - Let's get that.

1280
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:10.140
We have to get it.

1281
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.140
- How? - With our hands.

1282
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.210
(They're eager to get there.)

1283
00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:14.870
I have no hands.

1284
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.470
I'll throw this coconut.

1285
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.410
- There are crabs here. - Yes.

1286
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.910
- Where is it? - On that side.

1287
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.080
Right in front of you.

1288
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.450
- Here? - Yes. I'll go there.

1289
00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:26.620
- Here. - Where?

1290
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.720
Here.

1291
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.820
It's here.

1292
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:30.920
Hit it with the stick and make it faint.

1293
00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.230
- There. - It's there.

1294
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:34.330
- There. - The crab.

1295
00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:35.930
Byung Chan.

1296
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.330
Byung Chan.

1297
00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.660
It's over there. It's going in.

1298
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.670
- Where? Did you check where it is? - Here.

1299
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.770
- Over here. - Where? Corner it.

1300
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.900
Stay there. Ill go the other way.

1301
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.740
(The crab is stuck.)

1302
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.780
- No. - Go over there.

1303
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.040
- I'll go over there. - Okay.

1304
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.180
- Then I'll go this way again. - Okay.

1305
00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:55.780
It's right in there.

1306
00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.150
Let's break this stick and share it.

1307
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.380
- Okay. Break it. - Okay.

1308
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.650
(Byung Chan starts sawing.)

1309
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:03.920
Wait. Look.

1310
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:05.760
You need to use your brain.

1311
00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.130
- Wait. I'm sawing it. - I'll catch it.

1312
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.200
(Sawing)

1313
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.770
When will it get done?

1314
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:16.570
I can do it!

1315
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:19.640
(It won't break.)

1316
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.470
- Put it here. Look. - Byung Chan.

1317
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.580
(Goodness, Byung Chan.)

1318
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.710
Yes, like that.

1319
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.680
What if it ran away?

1320
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.220
This is taking too long.

1321
00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.520
Should I stomp on this? I think it'll break.

1322
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.920
No, turn it around.

1323
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:37.820
(Niel starts sawing instead.)

1324
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.960
Now, break it.

1325
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:43.660
Not like that. The other way.

1326
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.460
Good. Like that.

1327
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.230
- That's it, Byung Chan. - Okay.

1328
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.800
All right. We'll catch it now.

1329
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.400
Are you ready?

1330
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.570
(All right. Let's catch it now!)

1331
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.570
This way.

1332
00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:55.810
I think there's a rock.

1333
00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.310
It's coming out.

1334
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:58.780
- It's getting out. - There.

1335
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.910
- Don't move. - Okay.

1336
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:03.080
Calm down.

1337
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.180
(Moving away)

1338
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.380
Don't move.

1339
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.520
Hey, it jumped.

1340
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.990
I told you it jumps.

1341
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.430
- Where did it go? - Underneath it.

1342
00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.730
- Underneath my foot? - Under the rock.

1343
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:16.830
- Here? - Yes.

1344
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:18.100
- Where? - Next to it.

1345
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.130
- Where? - Here.

1346
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.570
That's not it.

1347
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.040
That isn't it. Is it?

1348
00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.270
(Hey, crab. Where are you?)

1349
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.310
I can't see.

1350
00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.980
What's this?

1351
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.310
- Hey, Byung Chan. - What's wrong?

1352
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.520
Don't go after the crab. Let's take this.

1353
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.580
(He picks up calliostoma unicum.)

1354
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.680
Get the easy ones first.

1355
00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.720
(This is how an experienced person hunts.)

1356
00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:44.460
(He switches targets quickly...)

1357
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.960
(in order to survive in the jungle.)

1358
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.690
Look at this.

1359
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.060
- What's that? - What's this?

1360
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.800
- This is something different. - What's that?

1361
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800
(They're good at catching inanimate things.)

1362
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.830
What's this?

1363
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:57.700
Hey. It's perfect.

1364
00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.500
- You're so good. - This is perfect.

1365
00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.910
We caught a lot.

1366
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.640
This is a lot.

1367
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.910
You sure are the experienced one.

1368
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.850
You just have to count on me.

1369
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.280
Jung Chul and Da Hee...

1370
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:13.750
might not have caught anything.

1371
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:14.820
- You're right. - Yes.

1372
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.390
- So we have to... - We have to work as twice as hard.

1373
00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.030
There's a crab! I see it.

1374
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.630
- Where? - Over there.

1375
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.160
- You have a great eyesight. - It's on the sand.

1376
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.230
We can do it, Byung Chan.

1377
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.640
Imagine what it would taste like.

1378
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.170
- Think about it. - It must be tasty.

1379
00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.640
- It'll be delicious. - Won't it?

1380
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.140
- It must be good. - Of course.

1381
00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:37.380
With one crab...

1382
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.680
Let's be manly.

1383
00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:40.850
I'll do it.

1384
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:41.850
(Let's catch this guy.)

1385
00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.680
(Niel hands over the gastropod, and gets ready to catch the crab.)

1386
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.290
(Come on out.)

1387
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.290
I can do it.

1388
00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.160
Here they are.

1389
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.560
They came out from here!

1390
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.160
- They are out, right? Where? - They are here!

1391
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.460
(The crabs come out to avoid his attack.)

1392
00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.600
Where? Are they all out?

1393
00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.670
You, punks! You! Gosh.

1394
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.070
Byung Chan, can you shake the stick between the rocks?

1395
00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.070
(Let me put them here first.)

1396
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.770
Why are the stones so big?

1397
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.770
(He wants to put down gastropods they caught.)

1398
00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.710
(Unable to find his way)

1399
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.610
Why can't I find a normal-looking stone here?

1400
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.520
Byung Chan, the sun might start setting.

1401
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.520
First, flip it, and put it down on the ground.

1402
00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.390
You can do it, right? There you go.

1403
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.560
(Goodness, Byung Chan.)

1404
00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.360
(Byung Chan finally helps.)

1405
00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.460
I can't do it anymore.

1406
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.060
- I can't do this. - How do I manage this? Gosh.

1407
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.170
- Come on. - Go for it, Byung Chan.

1408
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:35.300
- Come. - It's time for you to go for it.

1409
00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:38.200
- Goodness. - Byung Chan!

1410
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:39.910
Come back here.

1411
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.310
Crabs, no. Don't lift your claws.

1412
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:42.740
Hey, hurry!

1413
00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.240
Don't lift your claws. Hold on a second, Niel.

1414
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.250
My arms are about to go numb. I'm serious.

1415
00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.710
I'm scared to death right now.

1416
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:51.180
I'm really scared.

1417
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.050
- I can see it, but... - Come on. Go for it now.

1418
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.250
If it came out, you'd better do it quickly.

1419
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.760
It's coming out.

1420
00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.790
(The crab is slowly coming about.)

1421
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.160
Come back here, punk. No, it went back in.

1422
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.260
(He pushes the crab back.)

1423
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.360
It's out.

1424
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.970
(It comes out, but goes back in.)

1425
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:09.770
No, forget it, Niel. It's over.

1426
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:12.000
It's over.

1427
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.340
- You got it then? - No, it went back in.

1428
00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.570
- Sorry? - It went back in.

1429
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.310
(My goodness.)

1430
00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.280
Hey, we should get more people on this.

1431
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.220
- Right? So we should hurry back. - Okay.

1432
00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:25.920
Let's bring Jung Chul and Da Hee back here.

1433
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.290
I don't think we can handle this on our own.

1434
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.690
Wait, that. What is that?

1435
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.060
Where?

1436
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:34.460
It's right there.

1437
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.530
- Where? - There! Hey, stay calm.

1438
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.170
- Where is it? - Stay calm. Be calm.

1439
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.770
(There's a crab under the rock.)

1440
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:43.070
- Don't move. - Okay.

1441
00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:44.070
All right.

1442
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.940
Wing-formation.

1443
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.640
Wing-formation.

1444
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:50.540
- Hey, go that way. - I'll go that way.

1445
00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.680
- I'll go that way. - Go that way.

1446
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.180
You can do this.

1447
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.310
- I can do this. - Get ready.

1448
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.410
We'll use the wing-formation method.

1449
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:58.650
- Go, go, go! - Here.

1450
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:00.190
(March on!)

1451
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:02.650
(Dashing away)

1452
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:04.290
- Here it is. - Hey.

1453
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.990
Hold it down. Hold it down.

1454
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.090
No, hold it down.

1455
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.890
(Moving away)

1456
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:10.730
(Byung Chan moves away from the crab as he's startled.)

1457
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.260
- Press it down. - No!

1458
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Where did it go?

1459
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:16.570
We can catch this, right? We can do this, can't we?

1460
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.270
- Pardon? - It came out!

1461
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:20.810
- Where is it? - Hey, Byung Chan.

1462
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.440
- I'll be on the other side. - I'll block this part.

1463
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.040
(The crab runs away quickly while pacing back and forth.)

1464
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.650
(Niel chases after the crab like a persistent chaser.)

1465
00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.020
I got it! I got it!

1466
00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.780
Hey, hey. Just keep it down. Press it down.

1467
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.880
I'm holding the claws down.

1468
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.690
What do I do with this? How do I catch it?

1469
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:36.820
Do I hold the claws?

1470
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.860
You must hold the both sides from the back.

1471
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.860
From the back? Flip it.

1472
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.930
Wait a second. I'm holding the crab now.

1473
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.900
- Watch this. We can do this. - I'm holding it down too.

1474
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.470
- I'm holding the claws. - Should I let this go now?

1475
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:49.800
- No, don't let go. - Okay.

1476
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:53.370
I'm holding two claws now. Let it go now.

1477
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:54.670
All right. Here.

1478
00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.640
No, catch it!

1479
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.610
No, no. It's right here.

1480
00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:00.980
- I got it. - You got it?

1481
00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.650
- I have it. - Don't press it hard. It will die.

1482
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.480
We can do this. Hey, my friend.

1483
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:08.720
I did it. I did it!

1484
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720
(At last,)

1485
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.260
(he catches the crab!)

1486
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.360
(We did it!)

1487
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.200
We got it.

1488
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.800
Were you screaming?

1489
00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:23.800
Let's go. Let's get going now.

1490
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.770
- Admiral Yi Sun Shin's formation. - You bet.

1491
00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.110
- It's amazing. - Of course, it is.

1492
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.280
Let's stop looking for more food.

1493
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.650
Let's go.

1494
00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.880
Hey, there's more. There are 2... 3 crabs.

1495
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.280
Byung Chan, it's your turn now. I can't use my hands.

1496
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.320
But that one is bigger.

1497
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.550
Right. So should we release this guy?

1498
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:42.650
No, that's not it.

1499
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.890
Should I hold it for you?

1500
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.960
This might run away from you.

1501
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.460
Let's go.

1502
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.190
- Let's do our high-five later. - Okay.

1503
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:50.360
(Let's stop exploring.)

1504
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.170
- Hey, guys! - Let's go.

1505
00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.900
We brought gastropods and a crab.

1506
00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.570
- You caught a crab? - Yes, there were so many.

1507
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.110
- We saw many of them. - Aren't they fast?

1508
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.310
Niel caught it.

1509
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.240
They jumped around even.

1510
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.750
- They jumped around? - Yes.

1511
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:09.450
- I guess crabs are quite athletic. - They were pretty athletic.

1512
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:13.050
- Can one of you help me with this? - Yes, I'll help.

1513
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.020
(Carrying)

1514
00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:20.260
(Her instinct to run is unstoppable.)

1515
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.860
(She's full of energy.)

1516
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.970
(Da Hee can gather all the materials for the roof alone.)

1517
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:31.970
Where did it go?

1518
00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:34.070
- Let's go. - Go.

1519
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:35.870
Watch your feet.

1520
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.080
Let's move at the same pace. Don't move too fast.

1521
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.080
(They work together.)

1522
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.710
- This side is heavier. - Watch out for the stone.

1523
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:44.920
- This side is moving too fast. - That side is too heavy.

1524
00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.120
That side is too heavy.

1525
00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.150
- I'll move closer to your side. - Okay, move closer.

1526
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.160
I will...

1527
00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.190
move it with you. Why isn't it moving?

1528
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:53.590
That one is really heavy.

1529
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:55.990
1, 2, 3.

1530
00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.760
(Did someone just pass by us?)

1531
00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.900
Okay.

1532
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:02.770
(Pulling)

1533
01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:03.770
Goodness.

1534
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:06.070
- Are we almost there? - We're almost there.

1535
01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.240
I'm not sure anymore.

1536
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.440
Wait.

1537
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.250
(They finish delivering the log in the end.)

1538
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.150
- We are almost there. - We're close now.

1539
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:17.450
Let's take a breather.

1540
01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:20.290
- Should we take a break? - No, no. You guys can't do this.

1541
01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.560
(Da Hee helps the Chief to build the house.)

1542
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.790
Where should I put this?

1543
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.700
(Byung Man picked up every discarded nail.)

1544
01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.070
- Here? - This one is great too.

1545
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.200
(They reuse the discarded table systematically.)

1546
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:45.280
That's right. We should put it down vertically.

1547
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.340
(They work together to build their first house.)

1548
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.550
Watch your hands.

1549
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.650
(With the Chief's planning and their effort...)

1550
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.290
- It's done. - Yes, it is.

1551
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.950
Okay. This is nice.

1552
01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:58.760
Gosh, I just want to go to the other side on this right now.

1553
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.260
(Feeling proud)

1554
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.460
Since there are five of us,

1555
01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:09.170
two of us should go to the sea...

1556
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.640
(Thanks to him, their survival is more organized.)

1557
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.970
Can you go into the water and pick up some gastropods?

1558
01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.840
Should I go? Da Hee, do you want to join me?

1559
01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.040
- Okay. - Da Hee and Byung Chan can go.

1560
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.680
Da Hee and Byung Chan can go.

1561
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.980
- She's smiling that she's going. - Aren't you happy?

1562
01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.080
Come on. Hurry.

1563
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.220
- I guess she must feel hot. - Exactly.

1564
01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.190
Niel, I invited you because of this house.

1565
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:30.190
- I knew it. - Right.

1566
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.020
I'm quite good at building houses.

1567
01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.560
- I want you to do only hard stuff. - Okay, okay. I got it.

1568
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.660
- We'll be back. - we'll be back.

1569
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.100
- I'll see you later. - Da Hee, bring us a lot of food.

1570
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.370
- You know our storage box? - Yes.

1571
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:46.070
Make our storage box look like an island from here.

1572
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.570
- I got it. - I hope you make a pile with them.

1573
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.880
- Okay. Bye. - See you later.

1574
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.650
Da Hee's face is red.

1575
01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:58.220
She worked hard too.

1576
01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.150
Am I that red?

1577
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.120
You look like an apple.

1578
01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:04.790
A plum?

1579
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.160
(His right hand is fixed there.)

1580
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.360
That's a good thing then.

1581
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:11.360
- Do it just like this. - I see.

1582
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.760
- You can split it? - Yes.

1583
01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:16.430
Make sure you don't hurt your fingers. Start from thin parts.

1584
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.740
(Niel begins splitting the leaves.)

1585
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.840
Put them on the longer side.

1586
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:21.340
Alternate the leaves.

1587
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:22.610
- Alternate them? - Yes.

1588
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.840
(He strengthened the safety with nails Da Hee brought.)

1589
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:28.410
(But...)

1590
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.620
(Da Hee isn't here.)

1591
01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.780
(Without Da Hee, the energizer,)

1592
01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.650
(the mood gets somber.)

1593
01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.830
You can find some bushes there. Can you give them to me?

1594
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.090
They are underneath that.

1595
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.460
(These three guys...)

1596
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.160
(quietly focus on working.)

1597
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.870
Byung Man never takes a break.

1598
01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:51.370
- You know in the sand, - Yes?

1599
01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:52.370
we need a table.

1600
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.340
(He recycles leftovers.)

1601
01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.840
Let's make a table. We need it for dinner.

1602
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.210
When we put this up...

1603
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.280
With this,

1604
01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.180
when we cook, the sand won't get into the food.

1605
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.150
If we place this underneath, it'd be perfect.

1606
01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.020
(It's spacious for five people.)

1607
01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.460
When we all lie down here,

1608
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.690
- everyone can fit in. - Yes, we can.

1609
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.930
(The roof will stop the rain and wind.)

1610
01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:18.260
This is amazing.

1611
01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.560
(The roof will stop the rain and wind.)

1612
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:25.000
I only see the sea inside this triangle.

1613
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.070
(We invite you to the house with an ocean view.)

1614
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:27.810
The view is spectacular.

1615
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.940
- It's nice, isn't it? - It's amazing.

1616
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.640
- All right. - All right.

1617
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.250
- Good job. - Well done, everyone.

1618
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.880
All right. We'll move to the next island.

1619
01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.850
We'll move to the next island.

1620
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:40.720
We're doomed.

1621
01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:43.860
In my head, I had a plan to build the house right here.

1622
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.060
- Should we start? - Let's go.

1623
01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.830
- Where are we going? - Let's get going first.

1624
01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.060
- Let's go quietly. - Should we walk around it first?

1625
01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.130
- Sure. - Okay?

1626
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.470
- They will run away. - You can't run like that.

1627
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.970
(You'll startle them, and they'll run away.)

1628
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.040
(To catch chickens,)

1629
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.180
(making the sounds is nothing.)

1630
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:08.350
Should we wait in the shadow and come back when they show up?

1631
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.420
(The flock of wild chickens disappeared into thin air.)

1632
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.620
Hey, can't we lure them out with food?

1633
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.990
We can use the coconuts. They eat coconuts.

1634
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.890
- Really? - They'll come back when we wait.

1635
01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.400
Should we pick some coconuts and put them here?

1636
01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:26.970
- Here? - I'm not sure.

1637
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.270
I'm certain they will come back here...

1638
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:30.570
because there are a lot of coconuts here.

1639
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.000
We should pick one of those coconuts there.

1640
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.210
Go for it.

1641
01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.640
(They find coconuts right next to their camp.)

1642
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.240
(Wait.)

1643
01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.880
Can't you climb up on top of the wood block?

1644
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.650
- Here. - Can't you do it? You're tall.

1645
01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:46.820
Okay. I'll give it a go. But we are about the same height.

1646
01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.020
- Really? - Try it with this.

1647
01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.760
I'll hold you.

1648
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.330
I'll hold you.

1649
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.530
- Are you left-handed? - Yes.

1650
01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.960
Then you have to face the other way.

1651
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.030
(He's completely focused.)

1652
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:05.040
(He begins wielding his knife furiously.)

1653
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.740
That's great. Great.

1654
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:08.970
That's excellent.

1655
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:12.080
- Yes! You're so cool. - Gosh, what a cool guy.

1656
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.180
You're so cool.

1657
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.150
There, there. No, not there. Aim that part.

1658
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:16.620
Yes, you can cut that part.

1659
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.320
Yes, yes! Here we go!

1660
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.050
Go, go! You can do it!

1661
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.420
You can do it!

1662
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.490
- Goodness, you're so noisy! - I'm sorry.

1663
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.960
- I'm sorry. - You're almost there.

1664
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.290
I wanted to cheer for you.

1665
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.630
Great, great. Keep knifing the same part.

1666
01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:32.930
(Noises Kang Nam makes break him down.)

1667
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:33.930
What should I do?

1668
01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.930
(Gosh, he's draining my energy.)

1669
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:36.970
Cut the same part.

1670
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.300
- Don't rest. You're tired. - Wait.

1671
01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.510
- You're almost done. You're close. - Jump at the end.

1672
01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.540
- Jump! - Let's get him out.

1673
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:45.840
- How can he do that? - Hey, come here.

1674
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.110
- Pardon? - Let me step on your shoulders.

1675
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.180
- Shoulders? - Yes.

1676
01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:50.080
- Let me use your shoulders. - Like this?

1677
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.150
(He steps on the shoulders.)

1678
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:52.180
My goodness.

1679
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:54.790
- Hey, here you go. - Should you do this, Joon Young?

1680
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:55.820
Be careful.

1681
01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.190
Hey, my back is about to snap.

1682
01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.260
- This is... - Jung Tae, hurry.

1683
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.360
- Hurry. - Give that to me. Come on.

1684
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.500
- Come on, hurry. - Hang onto the branch.

1685
01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.530
Hey.

1686
01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.130
- That's even scarier. - Get the coconuts. I'm dying here.

1687
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.230
(Staggering)

1688
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:10.400
I'm dying here.

1689
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.840
Hold on a second. Hey, hey. No, no.

1690
01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.910
(He's panicking.)

1691
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.210
Hold on, Jung Tae. Wait.

1692
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.210
Just come down.

1693
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.480
(Kang Nam could have cost his life just to pick coconuts for chickens.)

1694
01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:23.150
- Move aside. - Goodness.

1695
01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.520
Hey, why couldn't you endure a bit longer?

1696
01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.220
- How much do you weigh? - Hey!

1697
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.290
What's your weight?

1698
01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:31.690
Hey!

1699
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.960
(He picks it at once.)

1700
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.290
- How did you... - How could...

1701
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.730
- Okay. - Okay.

1702
01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.000
- We need to crack this. - Come here.

1703
01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.600
- The ax. - Bring the ax.

1704
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.070
- I'll do it. - That's easy. I can crack it.

1705
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:48.540
- Hey. - Let's take five minutes.

1706
01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.710
Okay, let's rest for five.

1707
01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.550
- Hey, but our plan... - Teamwork?

1708
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.080
- to get closer was great. - It was, wasn't it?

1709
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.350
- Let's keep our alliance going. - You bet.

1710
01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.360
We're wasting coconut water.

1711
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.290
The sand got in. The sand got in. You'll be drinking the sand.

1712
01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:08.560
(The coconut water is sprung.)

1713
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.690
Drink it. You should drink.

1714
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.100
(Gushing out)

1715
01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.430
(Chocking)

1716
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.300
Jung Tae. No, what a waste.

1717
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.470
(He can't even drink.)

1718
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:20.740
You. My nose.

1719
01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:22.610
(I'm sorry, Jung Tae.)

1720
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:25.680
(Kang Nam takes care of Joon Young.)

1721
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:28.050
(Sighing)

1722
01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.210
It's so sweet.

1723
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.150
(I feel so much better.)

1724
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:34.350
(He wants to eat the inside too.)

1725
01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.790
There's another wooden block. Use this instead.

1726
01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.260
Drink it all.

1727
01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.290
Wait. There's nothing inside.

1728
01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.200
What? Why is it empty?

1729
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.200
What? Why is it empty?

1730
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:52.000
Then let's crack one on the ground. Like that one.

1731
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.240
(They check just in case.)

1732
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:56.170
(He picks up coconuts on the ground.)

1733
01:07:58.110 --> 01:07:59.380
- Is it in there? - Yes.

1734
01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.320
- There's a bit left. - Yes, there is.

1735
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.590
This is the sweet part.

1736
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.090
- It's the white part. - That.

1737
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.230
Try it. It's sweet.

1738
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.330
Well...

1739
01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.760
(Since my blood sugar is low, let me try it.)

1740
01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.860
Isn't it sweet?

1741
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.830
(He's tasting the coconut.)

1742
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:24.940
(Spitting out)

1743
01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.710
Gosh, how can this be sweet? It's not sugar.

1744
01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:28.340
(To wild chickens, it's the perfect bait.)

1745
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.340
- Isn't that enough to lure them? - Right. Let's take it for now.

1746
01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.110
- Must I spread it where they were? - Yes, spread it in the middle.

1747
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.780
The flat ground where they were earlier.

1748
01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:41.950
(Our backyard will be the graveyard for the chickens.)

1749
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.630
- My gosh, I'm losing my energy. - You are, right?

1750
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:49.730
That's why you must eat.

1751
01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.160
- We must eat. - Let's hurry.

1752
01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.400
Let's go pick up clams.

1753
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:54.970
- Sorry? - Let's pick up clams.

1754
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.800
- Who? - Clams.

1755
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.440
- Gastropods. - Are we picking clams now?

1756
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.540
Yes, we must do it now. Let's get going.

1757
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:03.140
We'll go in the water?

1758
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.680
(Meanwhile, on the other side of the island,)

1759
01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.920
(Da Hee and Byung Chan are getting ready to hunt underwater.)

1760
01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.890
(It seems they are making something.)

1761
01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:18.290
What are you making now?

1762
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:22.930
I heard that there are so many murexes here.

1763
01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:25.160
I'm making a net to put those in.

1764
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.470
I couldn't catch crabs. Will I be able to find murexes instead?

1765
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.970
I can't catch living things.

1766
01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:34.410
(Just trust me.)

1767
01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.940
(Da Hee makes a fish net with the laundry net.)

1768
01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.810
I'm not sure if I'm strong or not.

1769
01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.550
But I can be quite stubborn.

1770
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:45.550
I don't give up until I make it happen.

1771
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.390
I don't think I can come back empty-handed.

1772
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:54.090
I think I might have nightmares if I come back empty-handed.

1773
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:56.630
- Is that so? - Yes. I have to catch something.

1774
01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.560
(Before the shoot, underwater training center)

1775
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.170
I like being in the water. I like swimming too.

1776
01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.040
I learned I must be good at underwater swimming for this show.

1777
01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.080
I've never done that.

1778
01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.280
I'm planning to practice though.

1779
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.310
(Da Hee keeps on practicing.)

1780
01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:17.580
(2 hours later since her practice started)

1781
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:25.260
(After putting a lot of effort, she got used to underwater swimming.)

1782
01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:32.130
(Will her practice pay off?)

1783
01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:37.740
(These two, who look like models, set out to the sea.)

1784
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.810
(Looking courageous)

1785
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.810
- It startled me. - Why?

1786
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.780
- It startled me. - Why?

1787
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:52.050
- Didn't you catch this earlier? - I haven't seen this.

1788
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:54.190
- No, we didn't. - Let's go there.

1789
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:56.760
(Trust me, and just follow me.)

1790
01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.990
(This rocky island is their goal.)

1791
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:02.430
You have to be careful. I fell on my bottom earlier.

1792
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.560
(She checks her flippers.)

1793
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.300
(They put on the gloves.)

1794
01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:11.770
Okay.

1795
01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.370
(Da Hee gets comfortable.)

1796
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:14.410
Let's do it sitting down.

1797
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:15.470
(Da Hee gets comfortable.)

1798
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.850
(The youngest follows Da Hee's lead.)

1799
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:22.350
You seem happy now that you'll be going into the water.

1800
01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.880
I love being in the water.

1801
01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.090
- It seems like it. - Pardon?

1802
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:28.590
(Da Hee is in her element.)

1803
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:30.190
I don't think it will be scary.

1804
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:36.260
An actress just spat on TV.

1805
01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.300
(She doesn't care about her image.)

1806
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.570
(Byung Chan, the youngest. Our group's pride is at stake.)

1807
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.630
Do you think there will be fish?

1808
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.840
I hope so.

1809
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:49.110
(I can catch them.)

1810
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.040
For this moment, she was trained and prepared the gears.

1811
01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.450
Da Hee, the enthusiast, and Byung Chan are fully ready.

1812
01:11:56.650 --> 01:12:00.020
With strong will and high hopes, she sets into the water.

1813
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.820
Will her expectations bear fruits?

1814
01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.160
(What's the result of her first hurting?)

1815
01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.290
Next week.

1816
01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.600
(Their survival of laid-back guys isn't over.)

1817
01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.440
(He, who is starving, jumps into the water.)

1818
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.170
(But it's not easy.)

1819
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.480
(Meanwhile, the Chief's survival is systematic.)

1820
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.650
(The momentum is great,)

1821
01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:32.520
(and so is their teamwork.)

1822
01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.150
(The Chief ventures out!)

1823
01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:37.260
(The most luxurious survival on the Chief's island)

1824
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.660
That looks so good.

1825
01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.990
(Next day)

1826
01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.730
We have an announcement to make.

1827
01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:49.370
(Their base camps must be switched from that point on.)

1828
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.100
(The Law of Jungle in Cook Islands)
