00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:19.970 line:93%
I'm sorry for taking so long to come to you,

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:23.607 line:93%
I'll never let you go again,

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.247 line:93%
What are you thinking about?

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.918 line:93%
A lot happened today,

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:36.853 line:93%
I have a lot on my mind,

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.257 line:93%
You haven't changed your mind yet, have you?

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:43.894 line:93%
No,

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:47.864 line:93%
I really don't want to go home today,

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:50.767 line:93%
I want to go somewhere where no one knows me,

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:52.669 line:93%
You mother will be worried,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.939 line:93%
Especially if she finds out that you are with me,

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.241 line:93%
No, she will never find out,

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:01.044 line:93%
She was probably too busy fighting with those people,

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.381 line:93%
She's really energetic,

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:07.350 line:93%
I'll choose,,,

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:10.320 line:93%
a destination then,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.321 line:93%
Okay,

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.592 line:93%
I don't care where it is as long as we can be together,

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.101 line:93%
Yeon Ju,

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.369 line:93%
- Yeon Ju, - Wait a minute,

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.871 line:93%
Wait, Mrs, Yang,

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.340 line:93%
Why are you searching for your daughter here?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.543 line:93%
Yeon Ju, come out right now,

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:37.180 line:93%
Excuse me? I don't know who you are,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.617 line:93%
But what are you doing at this hour in someone else's home?

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.820 line:93%
Can't you see anything from wearing sunglasses in the night?

00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:45.555 line:93%
Don't you recognize me?

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:47.724 line:93%
Oh, my, Mrs, Yang,

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:50.227 line:93%
What happened?

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:53.897 line:93%
I'll be straight, so give me straight answers,

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.366 line:93%
Are you sure Yeon Ju's not here?

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.235 line:93%
Yes, I'm sure,

00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:01.371 line:93%
Whoever's daughter it is, there's no daughter here,

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:04.708 line:93%
Then is Dr, Lee home?

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:06.009 line:93%
No, Why?

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:10.046 line:93%
I'm sure,,,

00:02:10.147 --> 00:02:12.649 line:93%
Dr, Lee abducted my daughter,

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.417 line:93%
Abduct?

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.154 line:93%
Oh, my goodness,

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.223 line:93%
Did you say abduct?

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.805 line:93%
It's your smell,

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.042 line:93%
My smell? What do I smell like?

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:40.877 line:93%
Pretty,

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:44.314 line:93%
Pretty? Why?

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:47.017 line:93%
Because you're going to be my mom,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.153 line:93%
Do you want me to be your mom?

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:51.755 line:93%
Yes,

00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.160 line:93%
You're going to get sick, Come out now,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.797 line:93%
Dad, Come in, Hurry up,

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:02.232 line:93%
Yes, Come in,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.191 line:93%
I surrender! I surrender!

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:39.069 line:93%
So Won,

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.538 line:93%
So Won! So Won!

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:43.406 line:93%
So Won,,,

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.275 line:93%
Yeon Ju, Yeon Ju!

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:53.049 line:93%
Did you have a nightmare?

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.522 line:93%
Don't you ever go anywhere without me, Never,

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:04.661 line:93%
I told you,

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:07.364 line:93%
I won't let you go now for anything,

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:13.203 line:93%
But where are we?

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:15.972 line:93%
It's where you wanted to go,

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.175 line:93%
From now on, it's going to be just the two of us,

00:04:22.912 --> 00:04:24.347 line:93%
No, it's going to be three of us,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.102 line:93%
Here, Have some cold water,

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:47.771 line:93%
Try to calm down,

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.573 line:93%
What do you mean my nephew, So Won,

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:54.411 line:93%
abducted his ex-wife? What nonsense is that?

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:57.914 line:93%
Ma'am, don't provoke me,

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:00.016 line:93%
Listen to me very carefully,

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:03.653 line:93%
Yeon Ju was in a meeting with her future husband's family,

00:05:03.653 --> 00:05:07.957 line:93%
At the restaurant where the meeting was held,

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:11.394 line:93%
your nephew which is your son came into the room,

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.829 line:93%
He intruded on us,

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:15.598 line:93%
I saw with my own eyes that he grabbed my daughter's hand,,,

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:18.034 line:93%
and took her with him,

00:05:18.268 --> 00:05:20.470 line:93%
What? "A meeting with her future husband"?

00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:23.073 line:93%
She's already about to get married?

00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:26.976 line:93%
My gosh, what a world we live in,

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:30.580 line:93%
She got a divorce not so long ago, She's already dating another guy?

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.516 line:93%
Goodness, how could this make sense?

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:38.221 line:93%
Seriously? You aren't so bright, Mr, Unemployed,

00:05:38.288 --> 00:05:41.391 line:93%
Why are you digressing now?

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:44.394 line:93%
The point here is,,,

00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:47.263 line:93%
not about Yeon Ju's meeting with her future husband,

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.432 line:93%
She was in the meeting,

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.968 line:93%
but your son, Dr, Lee,

00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:55.705 line:93%
intruded on the meeting, grabbed my daughter,

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:57.140 line:93%
and ran away!

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.341 line:93%
He abducted her!

00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.642 line:93%
Excuse me,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.779 line:93%
My nephew isn't a criminal,

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:04.781 line:93%
As if saying "he intruded" isn't enough,

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.416 line:93%
now you're saying he abducted your daughter?

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:10.520 line:93%
If what you're telling me is true, go to the police!

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.655 line:93%
Sister of Mr, Unemployed, listen carefully,

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:15.525 line:93%
I came here instead of going to the police,

00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:18.094 line:93%
so he won't have a criminal record,

00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:21.664 line:93%
Either tell me where he is or bring my daughter,

00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:23.900 line:93%
Goodness, you're unbelievable,

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:26.569 line:93%
Old lady with a black hat,

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.572 line:93%
Why would So Won abduct a divorcee?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.574 line:93%
What would he gain from that?

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:35.912 line:93%
The ladies are still chasing after him,

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:37.714 line:93%
Let me assure you,

00:06:37.714 --> 00:06:41.217 line:93%
He has no feelings left for Yeon Ju, Go somewhere else, and look,

00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:43.086 line:93%
- Please leave, - No, no,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.890 line:93%
I won't move an inch from here until you bring me my daughter,

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:49.826 line:93%
Oh, my goodness,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.097 line:93%
Ma'am, put your feet down,

00:06:54.097 --> 00:06:57.033 line:93%
Why are you putting your feet on my table? Get them off,

00:06:57.033 --> 00:06:58.334 line:93%
- I won't, - Put them down,

00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.536 line:93%
- I won't, - Put them down!

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:00.703 line:93%
- No! - Put them down!

00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:02.705 line:93%
- No! - This is my table, old lady!

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:04.207 line:93%
- How dare you put your feet up? - I won't put them down!

00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:06.209 line:93%
- How dare you! - Look at you,

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:08.077 line:93%
- You're hitting me! - Goodness!

00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:10.346 line:93%
- Go ahead, and hit me, - When did I hit you?

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:12.715 line:93%
- When did I hit you? - You scumbag!

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:15.452 line:93%
- Go to your house, - No, I won't move my feet!

00:07:15.452 --> 00:07:17.287 line:93%
- Unbelievable, - I won't put them down!

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.289 line:93%
- Dear me, - Bring me my daughter,

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:23.226 line:93%
She's out like a light,

00:07:24.327 --> 00:07:27.764 line:93%
It must have been a long day for a six-year-old,

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:32.168 line:93%
Do you know Han Gyul never treated me differently just like her name?

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.841 line:93%
When she first showed up, I thought she was ruining my relationship,

00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:39.275 line:93%
so I hated her for no good reason,

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.412 line:93%
But she didn't hate me despite that,

00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:50.286 line:93%
I'm sorry,

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.790 line:93%
I'm sorry, Yeon Ju,

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.395 line:93%
Do you not hate her anymore?

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:01.831 line:93%
I don't think that's possible,

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:06.202 line:93%
She's the spitting image of you,

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.638 line:93%
You know that I really like your face,

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:11.407 line:93%
I'm glad that you find me attractive,

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.778 line:93%
And besides, I'm really grateful to her,

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:19.883 line:93%
She was the one who brought you and me together,

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:24.521 line:93%
From now on, it's time for me to love her dearly,

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:32.962 line:93%
Here,

00:08:44.173 --> 00:08:47.777 line:93%
When she had to draw her mom, she drew you,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.248 line:93%
She's at the age when she needs her mom the most,

00:08:52.248 --> 00:08:53.816 line:93%
but because she grew up without one,

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.387 line:93%
it seems that she's really taken with you,

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:05.862 line:93%
I can be a good mother for her, right?

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:10.767 line:93%
You said this yourself,

00:09:11.868 --> 00:09:13.870 line:93%
You said no one was a mother from beginning,

00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:17.407 line:93%
Let's take one step at a time,

00:09:21.744 --> 00:09:22.879 line:93%
Thank you, Yeon Ju,

00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:27.317 line:93%
I'm grateful too,

00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:31.354 line:93%
Thank you for not running away and coming back to me,

00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:34.190 line:93%
Warm up a bit,

00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:36.192 line:93%
and come down when you're ready,

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:05.989 line:93%
So Won,

00:10:07.256 --> 00:10:08.424 line:93%
Why are you surprised?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.995 line:93%
No, I'm not,

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:15.031 line:93%
Did you prepare this for me?

00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:18.134 line:93%
You had a tough day today, You were nervous too,

00:10:18.668 --> 00:10:21.104 line:93%
Try to relax while you enjoy the spa that you like,

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.541 line:93%
You haven't forgotten that I like spa?

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:26.776 line:93%
How could I?

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.446 line:93%
We fought the whole time on our honeymoon because I hated it,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.688 line:93%
Here,

00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:42.158 line:93%
What is that for?

00:10:42.158 --> 00:10:44.293 line:93%
Your mother is probably worried, Give her a call,

00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:46.162 line:93%
I'll call my dad too,

00:10:48.998 --> 00:10:50.900 line:93%
She's going to throw a fit,

00:11:04.614 --> 00:11:07.517 line:93%
Goodness, even the refrigerator is dirty,

00:11:07.517 --> 00:11:10.653 line:93%
I get that only men live in this house now, but,,,

00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:12.655 line:93%
my goodness!

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:16.392 line:93%
What is all this? Look at this, How dirty,

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.665 line:93%
Gosh, I'm beat,

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.002 line:93%
Hold on a second, I didn't even have a dinner,

00:11:26.235 --> 00:11:28.871 line:93%
I can't raise my right arm, I must have used it too much for the fight,

00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:32.942 line:93%
Yeon Ju, Goodness,

00:11:34.644 --> 00:11:36.012 line:93%
Oh, dear,

00:11:37.013 --> 00:11:39.515 line:93%
How can I sleep when you are here?

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:42.685 line:93%
You're stressing out my brother,

00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:44.353 line:93%
Please go home!

00:11:44.353 --> 00:11:46.656 line:93%
I want to go home too!

00:11:46.656 --> 00:11:51.027 line:93%
So go find your nephew and bring him to me,

00:11:51.027 --> 00:11:53.629 line:93%
He came to the family meeting with the future husband,,,

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:57.033 line:93%
and left holding hands with Yeon Ju,

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:59.302 line:93%
Do you really think I'd agree to that?

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.505 line:93%
Of course not, We should draw a line between public and private matters,

00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:05.041 line:93%
Shut the mouth, Shut it,

00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:07.910 line:93%
You have some nerve,,,

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.947 line:93%
speaking English with that poor pronunciation,

00:12:12.048 --> 00:12:13.616 line:93%
Do you think I have poor English skills?

00:12:13.616 --> 00:12:15.785 line:93%
No one ever said that to me,

00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:17.620 line:93%
I have poor English skills?

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.289 line:93%
Gosh, don't ever say that to me,

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:22.425 line:93%
"Shut the mouth" isn't pronounced like that,

00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:23.993 line:93%
It's "mouth",

00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:26.696 line:93%
Repeat, "Mouth",

00:12:28.698 --> 00:12:30.032 line:93%
"Mouth",

00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:32.301 line:93%
"Mouth",

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.409 line:93%
Yeon Ju, where are you?

00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:43.312 line:93%
I had a lot on my mind, so I came here to get some fresh air,

00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:45.681 line:93%
Don't worry about me, You should go to sleep,

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:49.886 line:93%
Hey! Do you want me to die of frustration?

00:12:49.886 --> 00:12:52.155 line:93%
You know how upset I am,

00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:54.190 line:93%
Are you with Doctor Lee?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.492 line:93%
Where are you? Where are you?

00:12:57.126 --> 00:12:58.194 line:93%
Hello?

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:01.664 line:93%
Hello? Gosh, she hung up,

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:04.901 line:93%
(So Won)

00:13:05.902 --> 00:13:06.936 line:93%
So Won?

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.407 line:93%
Hello? Is this So Won?

00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:13.509 line:93%
It's your aunt,

00:13:14.277 --> 00:13:15.912 line:93%
Where are you?

00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:18.447 line:93%
Aunt? Are you in Korea?

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:23.386 line:93%
I had a lot on my mind, so I needed some fresh air,

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:24.487 line:93%
I'll see you when I go home,

00:13:24.487 --> 00:13:26.322 line:93%
Wait, Wait,

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.624 line:93%
Are you with your ex-wife?

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.694 line:93%
You're not, right? You're alone, right?

00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:34.630 line:93%
So Won! So Won!

00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:39.168 line:93%
See? See? They went somewhere together,

00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:42.605 line:93%
They called us at the same time,

00:13:42.605 --> 00:13:43.806 line:93%
Don't you see?

00:13:43.806 --> 00:13:45.775 line:93%
He said he had a lot on his mind,,,

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:48.511 line:93%
and that he needed a little rest,

00:13:48.644 --> 00:13:51.380 line:93%
What? Yeon Ju told me that she had a lot on her mind,,,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.149 line:93%
and that she needed some fresh air,

00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:54.383 line:93%
They're telling the same story,

00:13:54.383 --> 00:13:56.285 line:93%
Gosh, they're driving me crazy,

00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:59.121 line:93%
I'm going to kill him!

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:02.358 line:93%
The phone is turned off, Please leave a message after the beep,

00:14:02.358 --> 00:14:05.761 line:93%
You scum! I'm going to kill Doctor Lee!

00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:11.400 line:93%
Oh, no,

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.302 line:93%
My goodness,

00:14:13.302 --> 00:14:15.671 line:93%
Gosh, my hand hurts, Gosh, it's killing me,

00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:18.374 line:93%
Why is this egg so hard?

00:14:31.888 --> 00:14:33.022 line:93%
What is it?

00:14:34.257 --> 00:14:35.658 line:93%
Are you still feeling cold?

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:39.562 line:93%
Drink this tea, It'll make you feel warmer,

00:14:50.373 --> 00:14:51.440 line:93%
Why?

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:54.410 line:93%
You like hot water, right?

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.212 line:93%
Do you want me to raise the water temperature?

00:14:56.412 --> 00:14:59.582 line:93%
No, it's just that I'm so happy,

00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:05.021 line:93%
I can't believe I'm here standing next to you,,,

00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:06.422 line:93%
and staring at your face,

00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:09.392 line:93%
Just a few hours ago,

00:15:09.392 --> 00:15:11.627 line:93%
I thought we were already over,

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:15.531 line:93%
So it feels like a dream to me that we are here together,

00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:17.500 line:93%
It's not,

00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:20.369 line:93%
Do you want me to pinch you?

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.038 line:93%
No,

00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:25.641 line:93%
Do you know why I was so surprised?

00:15:27.143 --> 00:15:28.778 line:93%
Is it because you were impressed?

00:15:30.313 --> 00:15:32.515 line:93%
You know I had a dream on the way here, right?

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:35.885 line:93%
I was surprised because I dreamed about this place,

00:15:36.285 --> 00:15:39.288 line:93%
In that dream, I was playing with Han Gyul and you here,,,

00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:42.024 line:93%
in this pool when I woke up,

00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:45.494 line:93%
How is it possible that I dreamed about this exact place?

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:48.397 line:93%
It must be a precognitive dream,

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:51.167 line:93%
I heard everyone has a precognitive dream once in their life,

00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:56.038 line:93%
Why do we have such dreams? It's so strange,

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:59.175 line:93%
When people are focused on a thing, or if they want something badly,

00:15:59.442 --> 00:16:01.644 line:93%
their brainwaves get tangled up and have precognitive dreams,

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:06.248 line:93%
Right, I saw a place like this on television,,,

00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:08.918 line:93%
and thought it'd be nice to go there with you and Han Gyul,

00:16:10.252 --> 00:16:13.155 line:93%
My dream came true today,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.426 line:93%
It was your dream? It's nothing much,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.895 line:93%
It's not nothing,

00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:22.932 line:93%
I'm happy when I'm with you,

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:26.202 line:93%
Whatever we do, however we live,

00:16:26.202 --> 00:16:27.670 line:93%
and whatever we eat, I'm happy,

00:16:30.439 --> 00:16:31.507 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:16:32.308 --> 00:16:33.542 line:93%
You're so pretty,

00:16:34.543 --> 00:16:36.112 line:93%
Am I pretty?

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.017 line:93%
I'm so thankful,,,

00:16:43.152 --> 00:16:44.520 line:93%
that I can be with you,

00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:49.058 line:93%
I'm so happy to have you by my side as well,

00:17:57.293 --> 00:18:01.597 line:93%
- Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you!

00:18:13.709 --> 00:18:14.810 line:93%
Eun Byul!

00:18:18.881 --> 00:18:21.350 line:93%
I'm going to work, Aren't you going to your academy?

00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:24.186 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.355 line:93%
Mom and Dad have been getting along,

00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:29.692 line:93%
They're not fine,

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:32.328 line:93%
Woo Joo, have you heard of fake marriages?

00:18:32.394 --> 00:18:35.397 line:93%
They're pretending to like each other because of us,

00:18:35.965 --> 00:18:37.466 line:93%
How do you know that?

00:18:37.466 --> 00:18:41.203 line:93%
I peeped into their room last night,,,

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:42.605 line:93%
just in case,

00:18:43.072 --> 00:18:45.574 line:93%
and it's just as I thought,

00:18:45.674 --> 00:18:46.742 line:93%
I don't think so,

00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:57.486 line:93%
Are you already awake?

00:18:57.486 --> 00:19:00.589 line:93%
Yes, the kids always barge into our room,

00:19:00.956 --> 00:19:03.225 line:93%
I didn't want them to know that we sleep separately,

00:19:03.492 --> 00:19:06.262 line:93%
You should've slept on the bed, I don't mind,

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.900 line:93%
You still don't like me,

00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.002 line:93%
I don't want to make you uncomfortable,

00:19:13.836 --> 00:19:16.338 line:93%
By the way, why did you have a hard time sleeping?

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:17.840 line:93%
Is it because of Tae Yang?

00:19:18.374 --> 00:19:20.643 line:93%
I think he's been caught up by someone spiteful,

00:19:20.643 --> 00:19:22.711 line:93%
I met her and persuaded her yesterday,

00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:24.747 line:93%
She said that it's already over,

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.482 line:93%
but then, Tae Yang came in right away,

00:19:26.682 --> 00:19:29.752 line:93%
I think she's just pretending not to meet him,

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:33.422 line:93%
Don't you think that maybe,,,

00:19:33.656 --> 00:19:35.991 line:93%
we have a misunderstanding?

00:19:36.892 --> 00:19:40.896 line:93%
Everything we know now is what Joo Ae Ri told us,

00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:44.700 line:93%
Maybe we should go and check with Lee Ru Ri and Tae Yang,

00:19:45.367 --> 00:19:48.204 line:93%
I'm not foolish enough to trust Joo Ae Ri's words blindly,

00:19:48.204 --> 00:19:51.106 line:93%
I've heard and seen everything,

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:53.742 line:93%
I've seen her hit and threaten in the elevator,,,

00:19:53.742 --> 00:19:55.477 line:93%
and heard the hotel manager's testimony,

00:19:55.477 --> 00:19:57.313 line:93%
What more do I need?

00:19:57.413 --> 00:19:58.447 line:93%
I,,,

00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:02.084 line:93%
trust my son more than Joo Ae Ri,

00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:05.554 line:93%
He has been seeing her for a while,

00:20:05.554 --> 00:20:07.890 line:93%
He's not that naive to be fooled by someone,,,

00:20:08.157 --> 00:20:09.558 line:93%
that he's been seeing for that long,

00:20:09.558 --> 00:20:11.827 line:93%
That's why she's a scary person,

00:20:11.827 --> 00:20:15.097 line:93%
I'll stop Woo Joo from working so that he can't meet her,

00:20:15.864 --> 00:20:18.567 line:93%
Woo Joo! Woo Joo!

00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:24.607 line:93%
He went to work,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.242 line:93%
What?

00:20:30.412 --> 00:20:32.214 line:93%
- I'll go visit him, - All right,

00:20:40.055 --> 00:20:42.691 line:93%
Where's my phone?

00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:44.727 line:93%
I can't find it,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.161 line:93%
Gosh,

00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:48.664 line:93%
Mom, you're scaring me,

00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:50.499 line:93%
What? Why am I scaring you?

00:20:56.872 --> 00:20:59.575 line:93%
Gosh, what's the matter with me?

00:21:00.142 --> 00:21:01.310 line:93%
Hello?

00:21:02.311 --> 00:21:04.179 line:93%
Hello, sir,

00:21:04.213 --> 00:21:05.714 line:93%
Are you leaving now?

00:21:06.382 --> 00:21:07.750 line:93%
You should come out fast,

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.352 line:93%
Are you in front of my house?

00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:13.389 line:93%
Sure, I'll go right down,

00:21:13.889 --> 00:21:17.159 line:93%
The boss is here to fetch us,

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:18.594 line:93%
Let's go downstairs,

00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:21.163 line:93%
You're so popular,

00:21:21.163 --> 00:21:23.866 line:93%
Well, if I can't be happy, at least you should be,

00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:30.906 line:93%
Cheer up, I told you,,,

00:21:30.906 --> 00:21:32.741 line:93%
that the truth works,

00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:35.644 line:93%
Let's go,

00:21:40.816 --> 00:21:42.151 line:93%
Hello, sir,

00:21:42.151 --> 00:21:43.986 line:93%
- It's been a while, Ru Ri, - Yes,

00:21:43.986 --> 00:21:46.922 line:93%
It's so cold outside, You didn't have to come here to get me,

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:50.059 line:93%
My husband keeps telling me,,,

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:52.061 line:93%
to not receive any favors from you,

00:21:52.161 --> 00:21:53.595 line:93%
That's why I'm here,

00:21:54.096 --> 00:21:57.199 line:93%
You don't have to ride my car from now on, Drive your own car,

00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.105 line:93%
My car?

00:22:05.207 --> 00:22:06.342 line:93%
Press it,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.147 line:93%
Mom,

00:22:12.715 --> 00:22:13.916 line:93%
Boss,

00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:15.217 line:93%
I told you that,,,

00:22:15.651 --> 00:22:18.854 line:93%
I'll buy you whatever present you need,

00:22:19.888 --> 00:22:21.724 line:93%
I can't receive a gift like this,

00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:23.859 line:93%
What did I do to receive this?

00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:25.594 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:22:26.161 --> 00:22:28.597 line:93%
You're the major reason for the successful 700-million-dollar deal,

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:30.666 line:93%
Actually, this kind of incentive isn't enough,

00:22:31.233 --> 00:22:34.069 line:93%
Just think of this as a company car, and don't feel uneasy,

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.138 line:93%
That will make me feel relieved,

00:22:46.582 --> 00:22:49.151 line:93%
Why isn't Woo Joo picking up the phone?

00:22:56.358 --> 00:22:59.962 line:93%
I'm going to oppose this marriage no matter what happens,

00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:03.365 line:93%
I came here to ask you to stay away from Tae Yang,

00:23:08.504 --> 00:23:10.339 line:93%
Don't worry,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.876 line:93%
Things went wrong because of Han Gyul's birth mother,

00:23:15.177 --> 00:23:18.747 line:93%
I explained it to your father to make him understand,

00:23:19.348 --> 00:23:20.916 line:93%
He will resolve this problem,

00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:24.420 line:93%
That's not the only problem,

00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:27.923 line:93%
Tae Yang's mother also really hates me,

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:31.360 line:93%
What?

00:23:37.733 --> 00:23:41.003 line:93%
How could she hate you when she hasn't seen you yet?

00:23:41.236 --> 00:23:43.105 line:93%
Why does she hate you when she doesn't know you?

00:23:43.472 --> 00:23:45.140 line:93%
That's why I'm more afraid,

00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:48.911 line:93%
There isn't a reason for her hatred, She just hates me because I'm me,

00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:52.981 line:93%
There's no solution but to break up with him then,

00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:56.585 line:93%
So, are you really going to break up with him like this?

00:23:57.152 --> 00:23:58.954 line:93%
The more I hold out,

00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:01.323 line:93%
the harder it will get for other people,

00:24:41.697 --> 00:24:42.931 line:93%
We aren't open yet,

00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:46.602 line:93%
- Follow me, - Why?

00:24:46.835 --> 00:24:49.471 line:93%
I told you to quit right away,

00:24:49.505 --> 00:24:50.739 line:93%
I also told you,

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:52.941 line:93%
I won't quit without any reason,,,

00:24:53.308 --> 00:24:54.409 line:93%
just because you said so,

00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:55.644 line:93%
There is a reason,

00:24:56.011 --> 00:24:57.946 line:93%
There is a reason why you should never work here,

00:24:58.647 --> 00:25:01.316 line:93%
- Let's go, Follow me, - What is it?

00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:03.252 line:93%
What is the reason why I should never work here?

00:25:03.685 --> 00:25:04.853 line:93%
Listen carefully,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.122 line:93%
The manager that you like so much,,,

00:25:07.723 --> 00:25:09.157 line:93%
is Lee Ru Ri's mom,

00:25:09.224 --> 00:25:11.827 line:93%
She's the mom of the girl whom Tae Yang should never marry,

00:25:12.361 --> 00:25:13.962 line:93%
She comes here frequently,

00:25:14.062 --> 00:25:16.832 line:93%
It's enough that your brother has associated with such lowly people,

00:25:17.232 --> 00:25:19.835 line:93%
Do you now understand why you shouldn't be here?

00:25:19.835 --> 00:25:21.169 line:93%
Mom, that's not fair,

00:25:34.983 --> 00:25:36.118 line:93%
Hello,

00:25:36.652 --> 00:25:38.387 line:93%
I'm sorry for making a ruckus early in the morning,

00:25:40.055 --> 00:25:41.456 line:93%
Get your things and come out,

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:42.791 line:93%
I'll wait in the car,

00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:45.594 line:93%
You can't leave like this,

00:25:46.194 --> 00:25:49.197 line:93%
You just called my daughter lowly,

00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:51.133 line:93%
I need an explanation,

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.901 line:93%
- Mom, - Be quiet,

00:25:53.101 --> 00:25:55.437 line:93%
You're a fool if you don't do anything after hearing that,

00:25:57.406 --> 00:26:00.742 line:93%
Tell me, What did my daughter do to be called lowly?

00:26:01.076 --> 00:26:02.477 line:93%
You also have children,

00:26:02.477 --> 00:26:05.047 line:93%
so you won't say that easily to other people's children,

00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:07.716 line:93%
Do you have any proof that my daughter is lowly?

00:26:08.617 --> 00:26:11.353 line:93%
Yes, you're right,

00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:15.691 line:93%
My children are precious to me,

00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:17.859 line:93%
So I don't say such things easily to other people's children,

00:26:18.727 --> 00:26:20.128 line:93%
But let me ask you one thing,

00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:23.131 line:93%
How well do you think you know your daughter?

00:26:23.632 --> 00:26:26.635 line:93%
Do you think that the side you know is her everything?

00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:27.836 line:93%
What about you?

00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:29.905 line:93%
How much do you know about my daughter?

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:32.741 line:93%
I don't know how many times you have met my daughter,

00:26:32.741 --> 00:26:36.044 line:93%
but I had my daughter inside my belly for 10 months,,,

00:26:36.044 --> 00:26:37.346 line:93%
and raised her for 30 years,

00:26:37.913 --> 00:26:41.650 line:93%
Do you think that you know better about my daughter?

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.585 line:93%
Sometimes if you're too close,

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.655 line:93%
you can't see the true side of a person,

00:26:46.922 --> 00:26:49.891 line:93%
People who are one step away,,,

00:26:50.726 --> 00:26:52.194 line:93%
can see better,

00:26:53.662 --> 00:26:56.431 line:93%
You wanted me to give you proof of why your daughter is lowly,

00:26:57.599 --> 00:26:59.835 line:93%
Because of your daughter, someone almost died,

00:27:00.335 --> 00:27:01.637 line:93%
and they broke off an engagement,

00:27:02.337 --> 00:27:03.572 line:93%
Did you know that?

00:27:09.444 --> 00:27:13.215 line:93%
Lee Ru RI, I don't want to explain these dirty deeds,

00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:15.083 line:93%
Tell her yourself,

00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:19.321 line:93%
Tell her why you got fired from the Guam resort last year,,,

00:27:19.588 --> 00:27:21.757 line:93%
and why the general manager sent a video of an apology,,,

00:27:21.757 --> 00:27:23.358 line:93%
groveling to a woman,

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.094 line:93%
She'll understand,,,

00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:28.196 line:93%
what kind of person you are then,

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.001 line:93%
Mom,

00:27:38.607 --> 00:27:39.741 line:93%
What does she mean?

00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:43.845 line:93%
What happened in Guam to make you so quiet and let her do that to you?

00:27:52.654 --> 00:27:54.156 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:04.800 line:93%
Are you crazy?

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.934 line:93%
Why are you doing this?

00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:16.078 line:93%
I understand now,

00:28:16.912 --> 00:28:18.814 line:93%
That explains everything,

00:28:19.815 --> 00:28:21.450 line:93%
That's why she acted like that,,,

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.152 line:93%
and Tae Yang's parents are opposing me so much,

00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:27.723 line:93%
This is ridiculous,

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.226 line:93%
What are you talking about? Explain it to me so I can understand,

00:28:31.226 --> 00:28:32.694 line:93%
Why are they opposing?

00:28:32.894 --> 00:28:33.995 line:93%
It's all because of Joo Ae Ri,

00:28:34.696 --> 00:28:38.166 line:93%
She fell in the water after we fought when we were in Guam,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.502 line:93%
She dramatized that incident,

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:43.872 line:93%
Not only that, she bullied me,,,

00:28:43.872 --> 00:28:45.307 line:93%
to break us up,

00:28:45.407 --> 00:28:48.243 line:93%
She's even making Tae Yang's parents side against us,

00:28:48.243 --> 00:28:50.512 line:93%
Wait a minute, Joo Ae Ri?

00:28:52.114 --> 00:28:54.182 line:93%
Isn't she the adopted daughter of the chairman?

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.185 line:93%
The chairman wanted them to marry, right?

00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:58.453 line:93%
That's right, That's her,

00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:02.858 line:93%
I don't know why she hated me, but she always bullied me,

00:29:03.892 --> 00:29:06.261 line:93%
Are you saying that Tae Yang's parents,,,

00:29:06.394 --> 00:29:08.663 line:93%
don't know about her true side?

00:29:11.933 --> 00:29:13.401 line:93%
I'm going to reveal it from now on,

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:15.904 line:93%
You just wait,

00:29:16.371 --> 00:29:19.374 line:93%
Everyone will find out what Joo Ae Ri is really like,

00:29:44.966 --> 00:29:46.868 line:93%
My sister and I couldn't sleep,,,

00:29:47.335 --> 00:29:49.704 line:93%
because of that old lady,

00:29:50.105 --> 00:29:52.374 line:93%
She is really ignorant,

00:29:53.408 --> 00:29:54.643 line:93%
Wait a minute,

00:29:55.243 --> 00:29:57.045 line:93%
Did Han Gyul come back?

00:29:58.079 --> 00:30:00.916 line:93%
She would've gone through a lot of trouble in the cold with her dad,

00:30:13.295 --> 00:30:14.429 line:93%
Gosh,

00:30:15.664 --> 00:30:16.731 line:93%
She's here,

00:30:18.366 --> 00:30:20.402 line:93%
Han Gyul, when did you come back?

00:30:23.672 --> 00:30:27.342 line:93%
She's sound asleep,

00:30:27.442 --> 00:30:29.177 line:93%
Okay, get some more sleep,

00:30:31.179 --> 00:30:34.649 line:93%
You're growing so fast day after day,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.252 line:93%
You're so adorable,

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:38.920 line:93%
Han Gyul?

00:30:43.692 --> 00:30:46.962 line:93%
- Gosh, What is this? - Oh, my,

00:30:47.596 --> 00:30:52.367 line:93%
Did you slap my behind?

00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:56.104 line:93%
- No, I thought you were,,, - Hey,

00:30:56.371 --> 00:30:59.541 line:93%
Even if you miss a woman because you graduated from your marriage,,,

00:30:59.541 --> 00:31:02.711 line:93%
and even if our children divorced,

00:31:02.844 --> 00:31:05.480 line:93%
we used to be in-laws,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.384 line:93%
This family is so vulgar,

00:31:09.384 --> 00:31:11.453 line:93%
- Gosh, - Old lady, look,

00:31:11.653 --> 00:31:15.891 line:93%
Even if I'm old, I'm not deaf, Calm down,

00:31:15.891 --> 00:31:19.394 line:93%
We'll get in trouble if people know about this,

00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:22.364 line:93%
Okay, let's stop talking about this,

00:31:22.364 --> 00:31:24.933 line:93%
I don't want to answer you because it's ridiculous,

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.068 line:93%
Let me say this one more time,

00:31:27.068 --> 00:31:30.472 line:93%
So Won has no relation at all,,,

00:31:30.705 --> 00:31:34.876 line:93%
with Yeon Ju, I guarantee that,

00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:38.346 line:93%
So leave my house,

00:31:38.346 --> 00:31:40.682 line:93%
- Sister? - What are you doing?

00:31:40.682 --> 00:31:42.417 line:93%
- Sister? - Why?

00:31:42.417 --> 00:31:44.319 line:93%
This old lady is still here,

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:46.755 line:93%
- She didn't leave yet, - My goodness,

00:31:46.755 --> 00:31:49.491 line:93%
- Gosh, - She's still here,

00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:52.594 line:93%
I can't leave until I find my daughter,

00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:54.562 line:93%
Please leave,

00:31:54.562 --> 00:31:57.933 line:93%
My brother's sick, He has to rest,

00:31:57.933 --> 00:32:01.369 line:93%
Leave now before I call police for breaking in,

00:32:01.369 --> 00:32:02.637 line:93%
Get out of here,

00:32:02.637 --> 00:32:04.739 line:93%
- Fine, - Get out,

00:32:07.442 --> 00:32:09.177 line:93%
(Paju U-Key Pension, 500 dollars, Ha Yeon Ju)

00:32:09.744 --> 00:32:11.546 line:93%
- Just a moment, - What?

00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:15.216 line:93%
Mr, Unemployed, Aunt,

00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:17.752 line:93%
Get ready to go out,

00:32:17.752 --> 00:32:21.022 line:93%
I found where they are,

00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:23.391 line:93%
What if it's not? How are you going to be responsible?

00:32:23.391 --> 00:32:25.860 line:93%
I'll pay 10,000 dollars in cash,

00:32:25.894 --> 00:32:28.063 line:93%
I'll give you 10,000 US dollars,

00:32:28.063 --> 00:32:30.098 line:93%
- Gosh, - Hurry up and get ready,

00:32:30.098 --> 00:32:32.200 line:93%
Stop talking nonsense,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.501 line:93%
Leave now,

00:32:33.501 --> 00:32:35.403 line:93%
- Leave so that I can get changed, - That's what I mean,

00:32:35.403 --> 00:32:36.471 line:93%
Hurry up and get changed,

00:32:36.471 --> 00:32:38.640 line:93%
- Come on, - I can't until you leave,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.175 line:93%
Get out of here,

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.669 line:93%
Where did you go?

00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:09.604 line:93%
I extended for one more day,

00:33:10.705 --> 00:33:13.808 line:93%
Let's stay here for one more day and go back tomorrow,

00:33:15.543 --> 00:33:17.312 line:93%
Do you like it here that much?

00:33:18.213 --> 00:33:20.215 line:93%
It's not about the place,

00:33:20.982 --> 00:33:23.151 line:93%
I don't want to go back to the reality,

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:24.652 line:93%
The reality?

00:33:24.953 --> 00:33:28.456 line:93%
You helped me realize that the Harvard guy is a conman,

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.893 line:93%
but Mom wouldn't let us get back together so easily,

00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:35.230 line:93%
It won't be easy to change her mind,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.332 line:93%
I don't want to,,,

00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:39.067 line:93%
argue with her again,

00:33:40.135 --> 00:33:42.303 line:93%
What if you run away again?

00:33:44.005 --> 00:33:45.140 line:93%
I won't run away,

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.241 line:93%
How do you know?

00:33:50.845 --> 00:33:52.047 line:93%
Are you sure now?

00:33:52.914 --> 00:33:55.216 line:93%
That's hardly enough,

00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:00.755 line:93%
How about now?

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.358 line:93%
Come on,

00:34:07.162 --> 00:34:09.097 line:93%
Now it's enough,

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:13.401 line:93%
What are you two doing?

00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:16.104 line:93%
I want to join you,

00:34:16.905 --> 00:34:18.273 line:93%
Come here, Han Gyul,

00:34:26.881 --> 00:34:30.718 line:93%
Yeon Ju loves you, but it's a secret,

00:34:31.052 --> 00:34:33.354 line:93%
I told you not to tell anyone,

00:34:33.354 --> 00:34:35.590 line:93%
It's a secret, You should never say it,

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.292 line:93%
I told you not to say it,

00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:46.668 line:93%
Mr, Kim, Are you sure,,,

00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:49.370 line:93%
you're going to the right place?

00:34:49.604 --> 00:34:51.606 line:93%
Don't worry, We're almost there,

00:34:51.606 --> 00:34:54.809 line:93%
Don't go anywhere, You must stay in the car,

00:34:54.809 --> 00:34:57.278 line:93%
When I call you, you must rush in,

00:34:57.278 --> 00:34:58.980 line:93%
and if Yeon Ju refuses to go,

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.483 line:93%
you must carry her to the car,

00:35:01.483 --> 00:35:02.550 line:93%
Yes, ma'am,

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.085 line:93%
Goodness,

00:35:04.752 --> 00:35:07.355 line:93%
Your 30-year-old daughter isn't a child,

00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:09.858 line:93%
She went out to get some fresh air because she has a lot on her mind,

00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:13.027 line:93%
Why are you so anxious to drag her home?

00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:15.930 line:93%
Why do you think I'm doing this?

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.301 line:93%
I'm agitated because your nephew,,,

00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:23.505 line:93%
flirted with my daughter,,,

00:35:23.505 --> 00:35:25.373 line:93%
and made her go blind,

00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.609 line:93%
Why is your mouth so filthy?

00:35:27.675 --> 00:35:30.678 line:93%
Watch your language, You sound ignorant,

00:35:30.678 --> 00:35:33.181 line:93%
If So Won's not there,

00:35:33.181 --> 00:35:35.950 line:93%
how will you compensate the mental distress,,,

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.552 line:93%
that my ill brother had to suffer?

00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.821 line:93%
In that case, I will,,,

00:35:39.821 --> 00:35:42.490 line:93%
dance in front of the Statue of King Sejong in Gwanghwamun,,,

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.893 line:93%
in my underwear,

00:35:46.027 --> 00:35:47.862 line:93%
How are you so confident?

00:35:47.862 --> 00:35:50.231 line:93%
That's not compensation, That's a torture,

00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:51.699 line:93%
Terrorism to my eyes,

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:54.169 line:93%
Anyway, let's see what happens,

00:36:00.141 --> 00:36:01.142 line:93%
Welcome,

00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:03.545 line:93%
Shut the mouth,

00:36:03.545 --> 00:36:07.081 line:93%
Someone under the name of Ha Yeon Ju or Lee So Won checked in last night,

00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:09.851 line:93%
Check which room they're staying in,

00:36:09.851 --> 00:36:12.420 line:93%
- Pardon? - The woman is tall,,,

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.622 line:93%
and has big eyes,

00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:17.525 line:93%
They have a small girl around the age of 5 or 6,

00:36:17.525 --> 00:36:19.561 line:93%
The man's dandy,

00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:22.931 line:93%
Three of them stayed here, Check their room number,

00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:26.401 line:93%
It's the customer's privacy, I can't tell you,

00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:28.169 line:93%
Call that room now,

00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:30.505 line:93%
Her ignorant mom is here,

00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:33.174 line:93%
Yes, One second please,

00:36:38.546 --> 00:36:41.583 line:93%
I'm sorry, I think they are out at the moment,

00:36:41.583 --> 00:36:42.850 line:93%
They left?

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.521 line:93%
It's lunch time, You should check the restaurant,

00:36:46.654 --> 00:36:48.423 line:93%
Where's the restaurant?

00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:57.665 line:93%
Han Gyul, You're eating way too much,

00:36:57.665 --> 00:36:59.234 line:93%
You'll get sick,

00:36:59.601 --> 00:37:02.904 line:93%
It's fine, Ru Ri's nickname is four servings,

00:37:02.904 --> 00:37:04.505 line:93%
She's also four servings,

00:37:06.007 --> 00:37:07.675 line:93%
I'm not four servings,

00:37:07.675 --> 00:37:10.445 line:93%
Grandpa said five servings,

00:37:18.086 --> 00:37:21.356 line:93%
Gosh, I told you, Those kids,

00:37:21.356 --> 00:37:25.293 line:93%
Her mother was worried all night,

00:37:25.293 --> 00:37:28.563 line:93%
Look how happy they are,

00:37:28.696 --> 00:37:30.832 line:93%
Shin Mo said they were completely over,

00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:32.900 line:93%
When did they get so close?

00:37:33.201 --> 00:37:36.871 line:93%
Don't stop me, I'll kill those kids today,

00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:38.740 line:93%
Hold on,

00:37:38.873 --> 00:37:41.276 line:93%
You don't even bother dogs when they're eating,

00:37:42.043 --> 00:37:44.679 line:93%
They're enjoying their meal,

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:47.181 line:93%
Let's leave them until they finish eating,

00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:48.549 line:93%
No, I should,,,

00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:50.251 line:93%
- Don't, - No,

00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:55.256 line:93%
I'm so nervous,

00:37:55.256 --> 00:37:57.625 line:93%
My heart doesn't calm down,

00:37:58.793 --> 00:38:02.230 line:93%
It's weird that my premonition never misses,

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.500 line:93%
What should I do with them? Gosh,

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.201 line:93%
Here,

00:38:07.669 --> 00:38:08.836 line:93%
Okay,

00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:20.081 line:93%
That jerk's doing everything he can,,,

00:38:20.081 --> 00:38:23.251 line:93%
to seduce my daughter,

00:38:23.484 --> 00:38:26.621 line:93%
Stop swearing, I want to hear what they say,

00:38:26.621 --> 00:38:28.756 line:93%
Stop it, I can't help it,

00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:32.794 line:93%
Your family looks very happy,

00:38:32.794 --> 00:38:34.295 line:93%
They're not a family,

00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:36.964 line:93%
It's a new year's event, Grab a fortune cookie,

00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:38.900 line:93%
Han Gyul, Pick one,

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.501 line:93%
I want this one,

00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:42.670 line:93%
Here, Dad,

00:38:44.339 --> 00:38:45.673 line:93%
Okay,

00:38:58.252 --> 00:38:59.721 line:93%
What does it say?

00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:02.123 line:93%
When you have a lot in your mind,

00:39:02.123 --> 00:39:04.625 line:93%
think of the happiest moment,

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:07.695 line:93%
It'll give you energy to love,

00:39:10.465 --> 00:39:12.834 line:93%
When was your happiest moment?

00:39:15.503 --> 00:39:16.604 line:93%
What about you?

00:39:27.148 --> 00:39:28.816 line:93%
Now that I think about it,

00:39:29.217 --> 00:39:31.352 line:93%
I think I was always happy,

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.921 line:93%
When I was young,

00:39:33.921 --> 00:39:36.691 line:93%
even though we were not wealthy,

00:39:36.891 --> 00:39:39.627 line:93%
my mom let me do everything I wanted,

00:39:40.762 --> 00:39:43.131 line:93%
Mom always says this,

00:39:43.531 --> 00:39:46.234 line:93%
She loves me the most,

00:39:47.001 --> 00:39:49.370 line:93%
and she's willing to give her heart to me,

00:39:51.773 --> 00:39:54.175 line:93%
So in my 32 years of life,

00:39:54.175 --> 00:39:56.811 line:93%
I was really happy thanks to my mom,

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.083 line:93%
but I'm happiest when I'm with you,

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.124 line:93%
It's something Mom can never give me no matter how much she loves me,

00:40:13.461 --> 00:40:14.862 line:93%
I finally get it,

00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:18.132 line:93%
I'm supposed to stay next to you,

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.102 line:93%
and you give me,,,

00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:23.671 line:93%
the reason to live,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.068 line:93%
Goodness,

00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:02.043 line:93%
Mrs, Yang,

00:41:02.777 --> 00:41:04.011 line:93%
Mrs, Yang,

00:41:04.278 --> 00:41:06.280 line:93%
Hold on,

00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:09.550 line:93%
- Mrs, Yang, - Let me go,

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.152 line:93%
Why would you just leave?

00:41:11.152 --> 00:41:13.020 line:93%
You have to take your daughter,

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.423 line:93%
You heard her,

00:41:15.423 --> 00:41:17.859 line:93%
I said no,

00:41:17.859 --> 00:41:21.062 line:93%
I said no at the risk of my life, but listen to what she said,

00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:24.932 line:93%
She smacked my heart,

00:41:24.932 --> 00:41:26.234 line:93%
That's,,,

00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:28.102 line:93%
You saw them too,

00:41:28.102 --> 00:41:32.373 line:93%
She said she has to stay with Dr, Lee,

00:41:32.373 --> 00:41:34.876 line:93%
and she can't live without him,

00:41:34.876 --> 00:41:36.644 line:93%
I said no,

00:41:36.644 --> 00:41:39.213 line:93%
Gosh, Can you believe it?

00:41:39.213 --> 00:41:42.450 line:93%
She's not my daughter anymore,

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.486 line:93%
So if you want, you take her,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.656 line:93%
You can let her marry your nephew or even make her your daughter,

00:41:48.656 --> 00:41:51.125 line:93%
- Do as you want, - Wait,

00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:53.361 line:93%
Sit down and calm down,

00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:54.929 line:93%
Let me go,

00:41:57.798 --> 00:41:59.100 line:93%
I understand,,,

00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:02.069 line:93%
how you feel,

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.773 line:93%
- I,,, - I heard you were widowed,,,

00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:07.875 line:93%
when you were young,,,

00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:10.611 line:93%
and that only thing you had was your daughter,

00:42:11.045 --> 00:42:13.948 line:93%
But now that her life isn't working out,

00:42:14.682 --> 00:42:16.584 line:93%
you must be feeling angry,

00:42:17.351 --> 00:42:20.855 line:93%
If you know all that, how can you let that happen?

00:42:21.122 --> 00:42:22.990 line:93%
She was tempted by a man,,,

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.926 line:93%
and was heading into a fiery pit,

00:42:25.026 --> 00:42:27.528 line:93%
so I tried to get another man to prevent it,

00:42:27.895 --> 00:42:31.465 line:93%
But he turned out to be a conman as well,

00:42:31.465 --> 00:42:33.334 line:93%
After all that,

00:42:33.601 --> 00:42:36.671 line:93%
I don't know what to do,

00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:38.673 line:93%
She's like my life to me,

00:42:38.673 --> 00:42:41.242 line:93%
and she's heading to a difficult path,

00:42:41.342 --> 00:42:44.545 line:93%
How can I let that happen?

00:42:44.712 --> 00:42:45.880 line:93%
Mrs, Yang,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.751 line:93%
I learned that there are some things that I can't change,,,

00:42:50.851 --> 00:42:52.520 line:93%
even if I try,

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.091 line:93%
It's wrong to think that we can do something,,,

00:42:57.091 --> 00:42:58.893 line:93%
to change our children's lives,

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.830 line:93%
Shin Mo had So Won marry your daughter so that he can have,,,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.799 line:93%
a comfortable life,

00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:08.169 line:93%
But he made him go through such hardship in the end,

00:43:10.871 --> 00:43:13.441 line:93%
I realized only recently,,,

00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:15.810 line:93%
that when children grow up,

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.446 line:93%
we need to let them go their ways,

00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:22.850 line:93%
I wanted to educate my children,

00:43:23.217 --> 00:43:25.820 line:93%
so I went abroad after quitting my job as a teacher,

00:43:26.087 --> 00:43:27.922 line:93%
After going through a lot of trouble,

00:43:28.623 --> 00:43:31.125 line:93%
I helped my two sons become doctors,

00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:34.629 line:93%
I thought they'd have a comfortable and good life,

00:43:35.062 --> 00:43:37.064 line:93%
But they refused all that,

00:43:37.231 --> 00:43:40.501 line:93%
One quit his job in pursuit of religion,

00:43:41.168 --> 00:43:46.440 line:93%
and the other went to Sudan to build wells as a volunteer,

00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:49.010 line:93%
They quit their jobs as doctors?

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.213 line:93%
It wasn't easy for me to accept,

00:43:54.215 --> 00:43:55.816 line:93%
I couldn't forgive them,

00:43:57.952 --> 00:44:00.354 line:93%
My husband suffered a lot,,,

00:44:01.355 --> 00:44:03.257 line:93%
and died,,,

00:44:05.192 --> 00:44:07.028 line:93%
from cancer,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.931 line:93%
That's when I realized,,,

00:44:11.465 --> 00:44:12.833 line:93%
that if they want something,

00:44:13.968 --> 00:44:16.871 line:93%
we need to just watch them go that way,,,

00:44:17.605 --> 00:44:20.341 line:93%
even if that means they're going to ruin their lives,

00:44:20.775 --> 00:44:24.311 line:93%
I know, but what are we to do?

00:44:24.311 --> 00:44:26.714 line:93%
It's tearing me apart,

00:44:26.714 --> 00:44:28.916 line:93%
How can I just watch that happen?

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:32.420 line:93%
That's what parents do, We can't do anything about that,

00:44:35.423 --> 00:44:37.525 line:93%
Turn around, Turn around,

00:44:37.692 --> 00:44:39.960 line:93%
You should turn around me,

00:44:42.063 --> 00:44:43.230 line:93%
Let's go the other way,

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.190 line:93%
You told me to prove that your daughter isn't good enough, right?

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.193 line:93%
Someone nearly died because of her,,,

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.028 line:93%
and broke off an engagement,

00:45:21.168 --> 00:45:22.503 line:93%
Excuse me, Woo Joo,

00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:28.142 line:93%
I'm sorry, but could I have your mom's number?

00:45:28.676 --> 00:45:29.910 line:93%
What are you going to do?

00:45:30.711 --> 00:45:32.146 line:93%
I think I'll have to meet her,

00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:35.216 line:93%
I think she must have misunderstood me,

00:45:35.649 --> 00:45:37.251 line:93%
I want to tell her the truth,

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.254 line:93%
Wait a moment,

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.294 line:93%
Mom, just wait a moment,

00:45:48.929 --> 00:45:50.030 line:93%
Thanks,

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.568 line:93%
Hello, it's Ru Ri,

00:45:55.236 --> 00:45:57.404 line:93%
I want to talk to you about something,

00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:59.673 line:93%
Do you have time?

00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:04.044 line:93%
I'm sorry, but I have nothing more to hear from you,

00:46:04.278 --> 00:46:05.312 line:93%
Bye,

00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:06.714 line:93%
I,,,

00:46:15.422 --> 00:46:16.924 line:93%
Don't you think that's too harsh?

00:46:18.793 --> 00:46:20.027 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:23.164 line:93%
Everyone sees things from their own perspectives,

00:46:23.164 --> 00:46:25.499 line:93%
So you need to hear both sides,

00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:28.669 line:93%
You don't need to care about Tae Yang's marriage,

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.071 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:46:31.605 --> 00:46:34.742 line:93%
Do you mean I can't care now that he's found his biological father?

00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:36.410 line:93%
Jung Do,

00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:37.678 line:93%
Let me just say one thing,

00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:41.282 line:93%
He's just known Tae Yang for a few months,

00:46:41.282 --> 00:46:43.651 line:93%
But I've seen him since he was a student,

00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:46.420 line:93%
If you make him unhappy,,,

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.023 line:93%
by trying to engage in his marriage,

00:46:49.523 --> 00:46:50.791 line:93%
I won't let you slide,

00:46:51.792 --> 00:46:53.294 line:93%
Are you serious?

00:46:53.527 --> 00:46:56.197 line:93%
Do you think we're trying to make him unhappy?

00:46:56.463 --> 00:46:59.500 line:93%
You should try to help him escape from the grasp,,,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.901 line:93%
of that spiteful woman,

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:04.271 line:93%
Do you mean getting him married to Joo Ae Ri by helping him?

00:47:05.773 --> 00:47:07.541 line:93%
I didn't want to say this,

00:47:07.541 --> 00:47:09.610 line:93%
but I'm suspicious of her,

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:11.879 line:93%
Have you heard of Eun Byul's story?

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.216 line:93%
What do you mean? What did she say?

00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:18.552 line:93%
Eun Byul! Eun Byul!

00:47:24.024 --> 00:47:25.292 line:93%
I heard everything,

00:47:25.626 --> 00:47:28.629 line:93%
Mom, Joo Ae Ri is really suspicious,

00:47:35.302 --> 00:47:38.672 line:93%
After seeing this photo, she kept asking me questions,

00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:41.609 line:93%
She asked me who you were and why you had this photo,

00:47:41.876 --> 00:47:45.479 line:93%
She would have known that Chairman Kevin was his father,

00:47:45.713 --> 00:47:47.214 line:93%
Why didn't she tell him until now?

00:47:47.715 --> 00:47:51.051 line:93%
If she's so caring towards Kevin, she should have told him before,

00:47:51.485 --> 00:47:53.120 line:93%
That's suspicious enough,

00:47:55.022 --> 00:47:56.257 line:93%
Is this true?

00:48:10.371 --> 00:48:12.640 line:93%
Are you working on holidays too?

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.941 line:93%
Father,

00:48:14.775 --> 00:48:16.944 line:93%
I came to work so that you could take a rest,

00:48:17.177 --> 00:48:18.379 line:93%
Why did you come here?

00:48:18.512 --> 00:48:20.814 line:93%
I told him that you could take care of everything,

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.850 line:93%
He wanted to see you so much,

00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:26.120 line:93%
It felt stuffy to stay at home,

00:48:27.354 --> 00:48:30.858 line:93%
You should take Ae Ri on a date on a day like this,

00:48:32.126 --> 00:48:33.360 line:93%
Gosh, Dad,

00:48:34.395 --> 00:48:38.232 line:93%
He has a lot on his mind, You shouldn't say that,

00:48:41.101 --> 00:48:44.071 line:93%
Haven't you gotten over her?

00:48:44.371 --> 00:48:45.873 line:93%
Give me some time,

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.876 line:93%
I want to resolve your misunderstanding,

00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:50.611 line:93%
I can't let you do this,

00:48:50.945 --> 00:48:54.415 line:93%
If you're still deluding yourself, I think you'd better leave Korea,

00:48:55.149 --> 00:48:57.651 line:93%
- Father, - I want to keep you by my side,

00:48:57.918 --> 00:48:59.920 line:93%
but I can't because I need to protect you,

00:49:04.925 --> 00:49:06.193 line:93%
(Lee Ru Ri)

00:49:07.394 --> 00:49:08.562 line:93%
Excuse me,

00:49:12.299 --> 00:49:13.400 line:93%
Father,

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:17.871 line:93%
Lee Ru Ri,

00:49:18.772 --> 00:49:21.108 line:93%
You told me you broke up with Tae Yang,

00:49:21.508 --> 00:49:23.277 line:93%
Why do you still contact him?

00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:27.081 line:93%
Make sure this never happens again,

00:49:33.354 --> 00:49:34.922 line:93%
You've gone too far,

00:49:36.123 --> 00:49:39.293 line:93%
Whatever you do, I won't give up on Ru Ri,

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:40.961 line:93%
Keep that in mind,

00:49:43.464 --> 00:49:45.699 line:93%
Tae Yang, Tae Yang!

00:49:46.333 --> 00:49:47.568 line:93%
Gosh,

00:49:47.568 --> 00:49:49.503 line:93%
Dad, are you all right?

00:49:50.671 --> 00:49:51.972 line:93%
I told you,

00:49:52.339 --> 00:49:54.842 line:93%
She's scary,

00:49:55.342 --> 00:49:58.045 line:93%
This isn't going to work,

00:49:58.612 --> 00:50:00.948 line:93%
I should send Tae Yang to America like Director Park suggested,

00:50:04.952 --> 00:50:08.989 line:93%
Thank you for coming here to help Ru Ri,,,

00:50:09.189 --> 00:50:10.424 line:93%
even though it's your day off,

00:50:11.025 --> 00:50:14.361 line:93%
Mother, you shouldn't say that,

00:50:14.461 --> 00:50:17.064 line:93%
I've never been apart from Ru Ri except for that one time,,,

00:50:17.064 --> 00:50:18.966 line:93%
I was preparing to go to the army,

00:50:19.299 --> 00:50:21.668 line:93%
You should think of me as Ru Ri's twin,

00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:26.840 line:93%
I envy you the most, Myung Rang,

00:50:27.041 --> 00:50:29.877 line:93%
Do you know how thankful it is that you can marry someone,,,

00:50:29.877 --> 00:50:31.945 line:93%
without opposition from your family?

00:50:31.945 --> 00:50:34.281 line:93%
If I could marry a rich man,

00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:37.151 line:93%
I wouldn't need any of that,

00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:38.919 line:93%
Gosh, how can you say that?

00:50:39.219 --> 00:50:40.921 line:93%
No one knows if I'll get married,,,

00:50:40.988 --> 00:50:43.757 line:93%
or just end up being misunderstood by everyone,

00:50:44.525 --> 00:50:45.959 line:93%
That's why I called you,

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.064 line:93%
We were wondering how we could explain the truth to them,

00:50:53.233 --> 00:50:54.468 line:93%
Who's here?

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.109 line:93%
Gosh, Oh, my,

00:51:03.444 --> 00:51:05.679 line:93%
- Hello, Mother, - Hello,

00:51:07.981 --> 00:51:09.149 line:93%
Are you all right?

00:51:10.084 --> 00:51:11.251 line:93%
You must have been upset,

00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:13.520 line:93%
I want to apologize for what my father said,

00:51:14.521 --> 00:51:16.256 line:93%
That's a problem,

00:51:16.356 --> 00:51:19.359 line:93%
but your mother must have a misunderstanding too,

00:51:20.194 --> 00:51:21.295 line:93%
What?

00:51:22.062 --> 00:51:23.230 line:93%
What's this about?

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.733 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri is behind all this,

00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:33.373 line:93%
Oh, my,

00:51:36.543 --> 00:51:38.178 line:93%
Do you like it?

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.749 line:93%
You didn't need to do this, It must be expensive,

00:51:43.217 --> 00:51:44.318 line:93%
It's fine,

00:51:44.985 --> 00:51:48.255 line:93%
You've been a big help to me these days,

00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:51.592 line:93%
If you weren't there,

00:51:51.592 --> 00:51:54.261 line:93%
I would've given up on Tae Yang a long time ago,

00:51:54.461 --> 00:51:57.030 line:93%
By the way, what brings you here today?

00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:01.969 line:93%
Father was shocked today,

00:52:02.769 --> 00:52:06.840 line:93%
Lee Ru Ri said she'd give up on Tae Yang in front of Father,

00:52:07.274 --> 00:52:09.209 line:93%
but he caught her contacting him,

00:52:10.043 --> 00:52:11.211 line:93%
So?

00:52:11.411 --> 00:52:14.781 line:93%
Dad made a final decision in the end,

00:52:15.649 --> 00:52:18.986 line:93%
He's going to send Tae Yang to America to study management,,,

00:52:18.986 --> 00:52:20.821 line:93%
and break up with her,

00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:23.991 line:93%
Is that why you're here?

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:27.561 line:93%
I need your help,,,

00:52:28.262 --> 00:52:31.064 line:93%
so that Tae Yang could make up his mind and leave,

00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:35.836 line:93%
Okay,

00:52:37.104 --> 00:52:40.040 line:93%
I was actually going to check something with you,

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.241 line:93%
I'm glad that you're here,

00:52:41.842 --> 00:52:43.043 line:93%
Check something?

00:52:43.944 --> 00:52:45.412 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:52:51.318 --> 00:52:52.819 line:93%
Have you seen this picture before?

00:53:11.505 --> 00:53:12.773 line:93%
Who's that person?

00:53:12.773 --> 00:53:14.641 line:93%
Is he someone high in Tae Yang's company?

00:53:18.412 --> 00:53:20.447 line:93%
Who's this?

00:53:21.215 --> 00:53:24.651 line:93%
It looks like Dad when he was young,

00:53:25.485 --> 00:53:26.620 line:93%
Am I right?

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:30.257 line:93%
Is it your first time seeing that picture?

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.794 line:93%
I'm not sure, I can't remember,

00:53:35.262 --> 00:53:36.330 line:93%
Anyway,

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.932 line:93%
why do you ask?

00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:41.401 line:93%
- My kids told me,,, - No,

00:53:42.002 --> 00:53:44.104 line:93%
Nothing, I was just curious,

00:53:44.838 --> 00:53:46.840 line:93%
Your tea's getting cold, Drink,

00:53:48.175 --> 00:53:49.710 line:93%
Yes, Mother,

00:54:05.192 --> 00:54:06.860 line:93%
I can't find a way,

00:54:07.761 --> 00:54:10.964 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri turned me into a piece of garbage,

00:54:11.031 --> 00:54:14.101 line:93%
I can't meet either your father or mother,

00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:17.404 line:93%
Gosh, That witch, She caused trouble after all,

00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:21.108 line:93%
I'll hide in the parking lot until the chairman comes out,

00:54:21.108 --> 00:54:23.510 line:93%
and when I see him, I'll tell him how terrible she is,

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:26.480 line:93%
Don't, That'll put you in trouble,

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.648 line:93%
Okay,

00:54:28.582 --> 00:54:30.250 line:93%
Can there be a way?

00:54:30.817 --> 00:54:32.619 line:93%
Even if I do explain,

00:54:32.619 --> 00:54:34.521 line:93%
they won't believe me,

00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:36.189 line:93%
And the same goes for you too,

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:40.427 line:93%
Right, They already have prejudice,

00:54:40.427 --> 00:54:42.195 line:93%
They won't see the truth,

00:54:42.462 --> 00:54:44.064 line:93%
There's only one way,

00:54:44.965 --> 00:54:46.700 line:93%
I'll settle it by tomorrow,

00:54:47.501 --> 00:54:48.735 line:93%
What are you going to do?

00:54:48.735 --> 00:54:50.871 line:93%
Leave it to me, I have an idea,

00:55:07.154 --> 00:55:08.755 line:93%
Have you seen this picture before?

00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:23.070 line:93%
It's late, What's wrong?

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.373 line:93%
It seems Tae Yang's mother is doubting me,

00:55:26.673 --> 00:55:28.108 line:93%
What are you going to do?

00:55:29.543 --> 00:55:31.411 line:93%
I should go with the last plan,,,

00:55:32.279 --> 00:55:34.414 line:93%
that Mr, Kim told me,

00:55:34.781 --> 00:55:36.149 line:93%
Last plan?

00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:41.254 line:93%
You need to show magic,

00:55:41.822 --> 00:55:43.256 line:93%
so they can trust you,

00:55:43.256 --> 00:55:45.092 line:93%
Tell me what that is,

00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:51.465 line:93%
You shouldn't use it,

00:55:55.335 --> 00:55:56.770 line:93%
It will,,,

00:55:57.871 --> 00:55:59.439 line:93%
hurt your beautiful face,

00:56:05.445 --> 00:56:08.582 line:93%
No, That's too dangerous, You'll get hurt,

00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:10.817 line:93%
Mr, Kim told me,,,

00:56:12.152 --> 00:56:13.754 line:93%
people don't trust,,,

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.756 line:93%
the words,,,

00:56:16.089 --> 00:56:17.791 line:93%
but what they see,

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.628 line:93%
It can't be stopped now,

00:56:22.262 --> 00:56:25.832 line:93%
I need to do everything it takes to get him,

00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:44.151 line:93%
Hat Granny's bad, She's an idiot,

00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:46.219 line:93%
If you hit my dad again,

00:56:46.219 --> 00:56:48.221 line:93%
I'm going to tell Grandpa,

00:56:48.221 --> 00:56:49.923 line:93%
Stupid Granny,

00:56:52.259 --> 00:56:54.261 line:93%
Han Gyul, What did you just say?

00:56:54.694 --> 00:56:57.063 line:93%
I think she drew my mom,

00:56:57.564 --> 00:57:00.100 line:93%
Han Gyul, Were you talking to the picture?

00:57:01.067 --> 00:57:04.604 line:93%
I hate Hat Granny, If she ever bothers my dad again,

00:57:04.604 --> 00:57:06.773 line:93%
I'll teach her a lesson,

00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:12.379 line:93%
Han Gyul, That's bad, Hat Granny's not a bad person,

00:57:12.379 --> 00:57:15.782 line:93%
No, She's bad, She's an idiot,

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.989 line:93%
I think it's because she saw me getting beat by Mother,

00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:26.927 line:93%
I finally realize that it's a war,

00:57:29.563 --> 00:57:31.832 line:93%
Are you sure you feel confident?

00:57:33.467 --> 00:57:34.801 line:93%
Don't worry,

00:57:34.801 --> 00:57:37.504 line:93%
She hit me so much that I've gotten stronger now,

00:57:54.588 --> 00:57:57.123 line:93%
I'm the happiest when I'm with you,

00:57:57.524 --> 00:58:01.695 line:93%
It's something Mom can never give me no matter how much she loves me,

00:58:16.176 --> 00:58:17.210 line:93%
Right,

00:58:18.111 --> 00:58:21.081 line:93%
I'm getting punished,

00:58:21.982 --> 00:58:23.350 line:93%
It's my sin,

00:58:24.084 --> 00:58:26.152 line:93%
There's nothing I can do,

00:58:32.792 --> 00:58:36.563 line:93%
Sung Tan, It's 2018 now,

00:58:36.563 --> 00:58:38.632 line:93%
What's something you want to do this year?

00:58:38.632 --> 00:58:40.834 line:93%
I want to accomplish,,,

00:58:40.834 --> 00:58:43.103 line:93%
everything that you want to do,

00:58:43.103 --> 00:58:45.005 line:93%
- Really? - Really,

00:58:45.005 --> 00:58:48.441 line:93%
Ever since I was young, I always wanted to get married before 30,

00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:51.177 line:93%
I'm 30 this year, I'm going to get married no matter what,

00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:54.981 line:93%
So let's go introduce you to my parents,

00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:59.619 line:93%
What if your parents don't like me?

00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:01.154 line:93%
Don't worry about it,

00:59:01.154 --> 00:59:04.090 line:93%
My parents said they're fine as long as it's a guy,

00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:05.625 line:93%
Except for one thing,

00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:07.127 line:93%
What's that?

00:59:07.561 --> 00:59:09.829 line:93%
My mom suffered so much,,,

00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:12.699 line:93%
that she'll never allow a poor guy who's also the eldest,

00:59:12.699 --> 00:59:14.234 line:93%
So don't be worried,

00:59:14.234 --> 00:59:16.670 line:93%
There aren't many eldest sons in the world,

00:59:18.772 --> 00:59:21.241 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:59:21.241 --> 00:59:23.276 line:93%
Why is your head down suddenly?

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:26.813 line:93%
Are you the eldest son?

00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:29.416 line:93%
Yes,

00:59:29.482 --> 00:59:32.752 line:93%
Gosh, I thought it was going to be easy,

00:59:32.752 --> 00:59:35.488 line:93%
We should be able to get married without the consent of parents,

00:59:35.488 --> 00:59:38.625 line:93%
We should make it a petition,

00:59:38.858 --> 00:59:40.060 line:93%
What do we do now?

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.429 line:93%
What if your parents oppose?

00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:44.531 line:93%
There's only one way,

00:59:45.966 --> 00:59:48.335 line:93%
Let's get pregnant,

00:59:48.335 --> 00:59:49.970 line:93%
Pregnant?

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.775 line:93%
How can you do this?

00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:57.711 line:93%
No matter what you say,

00:59:57.711 --> 00:59:59.646 line:93%
I'm not going to give up on Ru Ri,

01:00:05.552 --> 01:00:07.020 line:93%
There's no alternative now,

01:00:07.754 --> 01:00:09.789 line:93%
It seems Tae Yang can't make up his mind,

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.659 line:93%
Proceed with sending him to America like you said,

01:00:13.426 --> 01:00:16.196 line:93%
That's the only way to separate him from Lee Ru Ri,

01:00:16.563 --> 01:00:18.231 line:93%
I was actually worried,

01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:22.235 line:93%
Even her father wants to see you,,,

01:00:22.235 --> 01:00:24.738 line:93%
to grab Manager Jung,

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.741 line:93%
How can they be so shameless? They're the ones who caused it,

01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:30.644 line:93%
I'd never see them again,

01:00:30.644 --> 01:00:32.679 line:93%
You go make sure to cut them,

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:33.980 line:93%
Yes, sir,

01:00:40.754 --> 01:00:41.821 line:93%
It's me,

01:00:42.422 --> 01:00:43.523 line:93%
Today?

01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:46.693 line:93%
How about we go for lunch together?

01:00:48.361 --> 01:00:49.429 line:93%
Sure,

01:00:50.964 --> 01:00:52.399 line:93%
Make a reservation in the main restaurant,

01:00:52.699 --> 01:00:54.801 line:93%
A pleasant guest wants to meet up,

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.447 line:93%
I know you're worried about our children,,,

01:01:07.447 --> 01:01:10.083 line:93%
even though you don't say it,

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:14.754 line:93%
Please help Ru Ri just this once, Please?

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.543 line:93%
Come on,

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.882 line:93%
Honey, What's going on?

01:01:43.817 --> 01:01:47.620 line:93%
Aren't you going to do something to help Ru Ri with her marriage?

01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:50.924 line:93%
It's suffocating me, Please call me,

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.432 line:93%
(Cheongju Women's Prison)

01:02:16.449 --> 01:02:17.984 line:93%
Inmate 601, Jung Su Mi?

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:19.519 line:93%
Yes,

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.121 line:93%
She rejected the meeting,

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:22.922 line:93%
What?

01:02:23.123 --> 01:02:26.693 line:93%
I have to meet her, What should I do?

01:02:26.926 --> 01:02:28.294 line:93%
Come back next time,

01:02:28.461 --> 01:02:29.562 line:93%
Hold on,

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:33.299 line:93%
Can you give her this letter?

01:02:33.299 --> 01:02:35.101 line:93%
You can drop it on your way out,

01:02:39.939 --> 01:02:41.941 line:93%
What are you doing here?

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:46.112 line:93%
What are you doing here?

01:02:46.813 --> 01:02:48.948 line:93%
There's only one reason to be here,

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:52.152 line:93%
I'm here to meet Han Gyul's mom since this morning,

01:02:52.652 --> 01:02:55.255 line:93%
She must be ashamed to meet us,

01:02:55.588 --> 01:02:58.191 line:93%
I was about to give some money in custody and leave,

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:02.829 line:93%
What?

01:03:03.163 --> 01:03:05.198 line:93%
It seems you've changed,

01:03:06.232 --> 01:03:09.869 line:93%
You never met anyone you don't like again in the past,

01:03:11.337 --> 01:03:15.441 line:93%
I'm touched that you're trying to,,,

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:18.912 line:93%
put up with Su Mi whom you don't like,,,

01:03:19.813 --> 01:03:20.980 line:93%
to help Ru Ri,

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.182 line:93%
What else can I do?

01:03:23.249 --> 01:03:25.084 line:93%
I must help her,,,

01:03:25.752 --> 01:03:29.856 line:93%
to marry the man she likes,

01:03:34.794 --> 01:03:35.929 line:93%
Thank you,

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:41.067 line:93%
Don't be, I still have a long way to settle it,

01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:43.169 line:93%
Hold on,

01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:03.256 line:93%
Lee Shin Mo,

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:07.694 line:93%
The chairman is not interested in seeing you again,

01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:09.729 line:93%
Don't ever contact us again,

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.564 line:93%
I'll hang up now,

01:04:12.165 --> 01:04:13.333 line:93%
Gosh,

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:18.004 line:93%
Both the father and the daughter are so stubborn,

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:23.376 line:93%
Gosh,

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.413 line:93%
It's harder to meet a restaurant chairman than the president,

01:04:27.814 --> 01:04:30.750 line:93%
I have to meet him to explain,

01:04:32.552 --> 01:04:36.189 line:93%
I can help you meet him,

01:04:36.856 --> 01:04:38.391 line:93%
- What? - Come with me,

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:39.859 line:93%
What do you mean?

01:04:39.926 --> 01:04:42.195 line:93%
How can you meet him?

01:04:42.762 --> 01:04:44.063 line:93%
I have a plan,

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.232 line:93%
Hurry up before it gets too late, Let's go,

01:05:00.179 --> 01:05:01.714 line:93%
I'm sorry, I'm late,

01:05:02.081 --> 01:05:04.751 line:93%
No, My class finished early,

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.252 line:93%
I rushed,

01:05:06.753 --> 01:05:09.789 line:93%
Order something she'd like,

01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:10.924 line:93%
No,

01:05:11.391 --> 01:05:13.893 line:93%
Let's eat after we finish talking,

01:05:14.193 --> 01:05:15.295 line:93%
Yes, ma'am,

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.234 line:93%
How do you feel?

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:22.869 line:93%
I have aftereffects,

01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.172 line:93%
I was excited on the way here,

01:05:26.639 --> 01:05:28.274 line:93%
You asked me out for a date first,

01:05:30.209 --> 01:05:33.446 line:93%
I wanted to talk to you about Tae Yang,

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.082 line:93%
That's giving me enough headache already,

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:39.085 line:93%
Lee Ru Ri is so stubborn,

01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:41.087 line:93%
I don't know what to do,
