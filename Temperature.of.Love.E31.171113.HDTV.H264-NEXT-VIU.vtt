1
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.374
Come in.

2
00:00:19.203 --> 00:00:20.343
Mr. Park.

3
00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:21.744
- Hello. - Are you here?

4
00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:23.514
Welcome, Mr. Park.

5
00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:25.813
I came to visit.

6
00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:27.683
Is it all right if I come?

7
00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:30.453
Don't say such a thing.

8
00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:33.684
I agree. We like you, Mr. Park.

9
00:00:50.974 --> 00:00:52.504
I've been waiting.

10
00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:57.213
When will you allow me to be in your life?

11
00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:03.684
Do you think it's just fun and games for me?

12
00:01:04.324 --> 00:01:05.824
Why do you only think about yourself?

13
00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:08.393
I don't only think about myself.

14
00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:19.703
(Seowoo Hospital)

15
00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:22.033
Why didn't you come in?

16
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.503
I made this thinking you wouldn't have time to eat.

17
00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:29.414
Why are you just giving it to me? You should come in.

18
00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:30.914
I don't want to go in today.

19
00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.184
Take it, and eat it with your family.

20
00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:35.283
The lunch box is nice,

21
00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:38.283
but I like it better when you say hi to my dad.

22
00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:40.953
I have something to think about.

23
00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:45.393
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.134
Thanks.

25
00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:07.083
(Temperature of Love)

26
00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:11.153
You should eat something, sir.

27
00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:15.254
I don't have any appetite.

28
00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:17.724
Dad. You still have to eat.

29
00:02:17.923 --> 00:02:20.023
The surgery will take five hours.

30
00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.234
It'll be so hard on her.

31
00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:25.264
How could I eat?

32
00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:27.634
You and Mom are one.

33
00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:31.044
Mom will be able to hang in there only when you do.

34
00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.213
I brought food.

35
00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:40.953
Jung Sun made lunch boxes for us.

36
00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:43.683
Great. I didn't want to eat out.

37
00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:45.854
Then I'll get going now.

38
00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:49.094
Mr. Park. You should eat with us.

39
00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:50.523
You didn't even have breakfast.

40
00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:09.044
Is she in a VIP room?

41
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.944
It's going to cost a fortune.

42
00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:15.314
You should have told me if she got scheduled for surgery.

43
00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:17.784
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:30.803 --> 00:03:31.833
It's delicious.

45
00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:41.314
Dad, try this.

46
00:03:41.314 --> 00:03:42.314
Thanks.

47
00:03:43.743 --> 00:03:44.844
Do you want water, Dad?

48
00:03:45.814 --> 00:03:46.814
Yes.

49
00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:48.814
Do you want water too, Mr. Park?

50
00:03:49.254 --> 00:03:50.254
Yes, please.

51
00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:52.683
I'm jealous.

52
00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:56.094
You'll get to eat like this a lot since your boyfriend's a chef.

53
00:03:57.294 --> 00:03:59.094
I'm sick of rice.

54
00:03:59.423 --> 00:04:00.893
If you're jealous, that means you lost.

55
00:04:00.893 --> 00:04:03.463
I can't lose to you, so I'll take it back.

56
00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:07.403
I feel better now that I'm eating some food.

57
00:04:07.403 --> 00:04:08.403
I agree.

58
00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:11.004
I thought I was going to die from suffocation.

59
00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:12.844
Hey, eat yours.

60
00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:14.914
Don't start again.

61
00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:18.013
I think it's nice because it livens up the mood.

62
00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:27.253
What do you like, Sous Chef?

63
00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:28.294
Something warm.

64
00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:30.024
That's nice.

65
00:04:32.323 --> 00:04:33.524
I like that, but...

66
00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:35.894
I also like seafood.

67
00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:38.034
- It's filling. - Seafood is delicious too.

68
00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:40.834
You guys are so friendly these days.

69
00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:42.104
It's not like that.

70
00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:43.404
Then go out with me?

71
00:04:43.844 --> 00:04:45.544
- Do you want some of this? - No.

72
00:04:45.604 --> 00:04:46.644
- I don't. - Do you want some of this?

73
00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:47.644
No, I don't.

74
00:04:50.813 --> 00:04:54.354
You know the men Soo Jung wasn't sure about...

75
00:04:55.284 --> 00:04:56.813
The men who didn't finish their dish?

76
00:04:57.923 --> 00:04:58.923
What about them?

77
00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:02.154
If they were from Michelin, we won't get a star, right?

78
00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:03.423
Probably not.

79
00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:05.493
We screwed up the sauce.

80
00:05:06.024 --> 00:05:08.794
Then our restaurant will go down even more.

81
00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:11.164
You can go down with it.

82
00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:13.904
Once the Michelin result is out in November,

83
00:05:14.373 --> 00:05:15.404
I'm leaving.

84
00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:18.604
You have no sense of loyalty.

85
00:05:19.104 --> 00:05:21.743
You can't say that when all you care about is money.

86
00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:24.214
Hey.

87
00:05:25.013 --> 00:05:27.984
"Hey"? How dare you call me hey?

88
00:05:27.984 --> 00:05:29.914
Stop it. He's just a kid.

89
00:05:30.623 --> 00:05:31.854
I'm not a kid.

90
00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:54.974
You're sitting here like a girl.

91
00:05:56.414 --> 00:05:58.214
Stop talking nonsense.

92
00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:01.313
I'll sit here too.

93
00:06:03.714 --> 00:06:04.984
This reminds me of my childhood.

94
00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:08.654
Why are you doing this?

95
00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:11.993
I said that I would ride the bus, but you insisted on coming with me.

96
00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:13.263
Then you were late!

97
00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:17.133
You can sit here alone and think about your childhood.

98
00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:18.604
Well, I...

99
00:06:24.443 --> 00:06:25.474
Why are you doing this to me?

100
00:06:25.774 --> 00:06:27.243
Why are you talking down to me?

101
00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:30.584
Well, I did this and that.

102
00:06:30.584 --> 00:06:32.284
What do you mean this and that?

103
00:06:32.784 --> 00:06:35.784
I've been sending you signs, but why are you ignoring them?

104
00:06:35.883 --> 00:06:37.623
Why do you think?

105
00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:39.323
It means I'm not interested.

106
00:06:40.553 --> 00:06:41.553
Fine.

107
00:06:42.024 --> 00:06:44.323
Do you hate me, or do you hate dating?

108
00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:46.363
Both.

109
00:06:48.563 --> 00:06:52.164
I've never worked so hard to get someone with glasses...

110
00:06:52.164 --> 00:06:53.664
who is not my type.

111
00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:55.303
This is a first for me too.

112
00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:59.404
I've never had any men act like this because of me.

113
00:07:00.644 --> 00:07:04.613
So I'll just enjoy this kind of thing a little more.

114
00:07:07.753 --> 00:07:08.753
Kyung.

115
00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:12.123
Isn't this for Hyun Soo's mom?

116
00:07:13.154 --> 00:07:14.493
That's right.

117
00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:16.794
You want me to carry this?

118
00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:18.763
Because you don't want to?

119
00:07:18.763 --> 00:07:21.734
No, because I want to talk to you.

120
00:07:28.104 --> 00:07:29.803
I bought it for you, Kyung.

121
00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:33.474
Well... You kind of look like that bear.

122
00:07:37.443 --> 00:07:38.443
Kyung.

123
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:40.914
- Writer Hwangbo. - What?

124
00:07:41.354 --> 00:07:42.883
Let's walk together.

125
00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:02.433
It was delicious.

126
00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:04.873
Thanks to you, my dad ate something.

127
00:08:30.704 --> 00:08:32.804
We have 3 lunch reservations for 10 people,

128
00:08:32.863 --> 00:08:34.503
and 3 dinner reservations for 8 people.

129
00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:36.033
That's one more table than yesterday.

130
00:08:36.903 --> 00:08:37.944
Yes!

131
00:08:47.084 --> 00:08:48.113
Mr. Park.

132
00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:49.584
Are you here for a meeting?

133
00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:52.484
Yes. Can't you change the director?

134
00:08:54.424 --> 00:08:55.694
Why are you doing this again?

135
00:08:56.924 --> 00:08:59.663
Whenever I see you, I want to cause you problems.

136
00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:07.334
You took care of Hyun Soo's hospital problem.

137
00:09:07.704 --> 00:09:09.773
Because it was something I could take care of.

138
00:09:10.234 --> 00:09:13.273
You could take care of it, because I told you about the problem.

139
00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:17.643
I'm still rooting for you and Hyun Soo.

140
00:09:18.113 --> 00:09:20.783
I want Jung Sun to grow old alone.

141
00:09:21.814 --> 00:09:23.854
I guess you have a lot of grudges.

142
00:09:24.023 --> 00:09:25.653
I'm a fan who turned into his anti-fan.

143
00:09:26.753 --> 00:09:29.523
He never does things roughly. He has clear lines.

144
00:09:29.924 --> 00:09:32.293
I liked him because he couldn't do things roughly.

145
00:09:32.724 --> 00:09:35.633
If you want to have the girlfriend of the person you like,

146
00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:37.363
you can't have that mindset.

147
00:09:37.663 --> 00:09:40.163
You have to know your enemy and yourself to win.

148
00:09:40.334 --> 00:09:42.674
Then win. That's all I want.

149
00:09:43.804 --> 00:09:45.604
Go have a meeting with Director Min now.

150
00:09:45.903 --> 00:09:49.714
Your work is On Entertainment's highly anticipated drama.

151
00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:51.883
Mine should be the only anticipated drama.

152
00:09:55.714 --> 00:09:57.984
(Operating room)

153
00:10:24.584 --> 00:10:27.184
(Operating room)

154
00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:44.503
Yes.

155
00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:47.304
Mr. Park. Ms. Lee's mother...

156
00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:49.104
is still in operation.

157
00:10:49.873 --> 00:10:51.174
It's taking longer than scheduled.

158
00:10:51.944 --> 00:10:52.974
All right.

159
00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:13.293
I heard Hyun Soo's mother had surgery.

160
00:11:13.863 --> 00:11:15.064
How did you find out about that?

161
00:11:15.334 --> 00:11:17.204
Won Joon told me on my way in.

162
00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:19.763
I feel so bad for her. She's still so young.

163
00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:22.304
Hyun Soo must feel very upset.

164
00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:25.944
You should be grateful that you don't need to worry about my health.

165
00:11:29.613 --> 00:11:30.844
Are you not mad at me anymore?

166
00:11:34.613 --> 00:11:35.653
Here.

167
00:11:37.523 --> 00:11:39.523
Your hands are always wet.

168
00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:43.554
It's something I already had. I didn't buy it.

169
00:11:44.763 --> 00:11:48.033
I used to use it, but I brought it to give it to you. It's really nice.

170
00:11:55.533 --> 00:11:57.204
I'm trying right now.

171
00:11:58.373 --> 00:12:00.743
You might not really recognize a difference,

172
00:12:01.714 --> 00:12:04.243
but I'm really doing my best.

173
00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:09.314
Did you eat?

174
00:12:10.454 --> 00:12:11.484
Yes, I ate.

175
00:12:23.094 --> 00:12:24.133
Mr. Park.

176
00:12:27.974 --> 00:12:31.344
Her surgery ended well, so you don't need to worry.

177
00:12:32.243 --> 00:12:33.344
Thank you.

178
00:13:00.873 --> 00:13:02.003
Can I meet her?

179
00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:04.804
Don't be too startled.

180
00:13:10.913 --> 00:13:12.013
Welcome.

181
00:13:14.783 --> 00:13:15.814
Hello.

182
00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:19.924
I'm glad you're here. Thank you for the delicious breakfast.

183
00:13:23.694 --> 00:13:25.964
I wanted to see you before you had your surgery,

184
00:13:26.064 --> 00:13:27.893
but I couldn't because you were sleeping.

185
00:13:28.263 --> 00:13:30.094
It's okay.

186
00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:34.174
I made some food that will help with her recovery after surgery.

187
00:13:34.174 --> 00:13:36.104
My goodness. Thank you.

188
00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:38.003
We owe you for your kindness.

189
00:13:38.373 --> 00:13:40.974
I'm glad I can do this for you. You don't owe me anything.

190
00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.013
Thank you.

191
00:13:50.554 --> 00:13:52.123
What brings you here in the middle of work?

192
00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:55.393
Why aren't you at the hospital? I just came back from there.

193
00:13:55.993 --> 00:13:58.993
By the way, Chef On came with a lot of food.

194
00:14:00.224 --> 00:14:01.863
I'm thinking about learning how to cook.

195
00:14:01.863 --> 00:14:04.033
I think Kyung has a thing for men who can cook.

196
00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.503
Why are you being such a fool?

197
00:14:09.273 --> 00:14:11.003
You only ended up benefiting Chef On.

198
00:14:11.003 --> 00:14:12.844
I'm so touched by your pure love.

199
00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:15.273
Give me the drama proposal before your meeting.

200
00:14:15.613 --> 00:14:17.613
Hyun Soo didn't give it to me yet. I'll tell her to give it to you.

201
00:14:29.824 --> 00:14:30.863
It's hard, isn't it?

202
00:14:32.724 --> 00:14:34.633
Her surgery went well,

203
00:14:35.363 --> 00:14:37.094
so I just hope she recovers quickly.

204
00:14:40.503 --> 00:14:41.974
I want to be of help.

205
00:14:42.934 --> 00:14:44.804
The fact that you're beside me...

206
00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:48.243
is enough to make me feel better.

207
00:14:52.113 --> 00:14:53.344
How long is she going to be hospitalized for?

208
00:14:54.084 --> 00:14:55.184
About a week.

209
00:14:59.383 --> 00:15:02.793
I'll keep cooking for her, so don't worry about that.

210
00:15:04.623 --> 00:15:08.094
I'm benefiting a lot from having a boyfriend who's a chef.

211
00:15:28.354 --> 00:15:30.924
Hello. Did you come to check up on her?

212
00:15:30.924 --> 00:15:31.924
Yes.

213
00:15:33.554 --> 00:15:36.753
I had to check up on her because Mr. Park pleaded me to do so.

214
00:15:37.224 --> 00:15:38.263
I see.

215
00:15:38.594 --> 00:15:41.033
Some people might think he's her son-in-law.

216
00:15:41.293 --> 00:15:43.263
He even came to see me earlier after her surgery.

217
00:15:44.334 --> 00:15:46.064
- I'll go now. - Thank you.

218

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

219
00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:22.734
My gosh, I fell asleep.

220
00:16:22.903 --> 00:16:24.043
You should sleep, Dad.

221
00:16:27.844 --> 00:16:31.684
Mr. Park is our family's savior.

222
00:16:35.613 --> 00:16:36.984
Since your mom's sleeping,

223
00:16:38.484 --> 00:16:39.684
I should get some sleep too.

224
00:16:39.984 --> 00:16:40.993
Lie down.

225
00:16:40.993 --> 00:16:43.153
Okay. Thank you.

226
00:17:05.243 --> 00:17:07.144
(A few days later)

227
00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:13.023
Hello.

228
00:17:13.753 --> 00:17:16.353
- Is Mr. Park inside? - Yes.

229
00:17:28.434 --> 00:17:29.503
Hello.

230
00:17:31.474 --> 00:17:33.603
What's gotten into you? You rarely come to visit.

231
00:17:34.813 --> 00:17:36.243
I'm human too.

232
00:17:37.343 --> 00:17:38.513
I never said you weren't.

233
00:17:41.884 --> 00:17:43.283
Thank you for looking after my mom.

234
00:17:45.424 --> 00:17:49.293
We still have trust for each other.

235
00:17:52.624 --> 00:17:54.533
And who's the one who took that trust very lightly?

236
00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.964
I wouldn't have come here if I had taken it lightly.

237
00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:01.204
I always tell you...

238
00:18:02.174 --> 00:18:05.543
that I'm thankful and I'm sorry.

239
00:18:06.944 --> 00:18:10.914
I thought I'd never have to say that to you again, but here I am.

240
00:18:11.743 --> 00:18:14.753
You think you always only received things from me, don't you?

241
00:18:16.253 --> 00:18:17.323
But you're wrong.

242
00:18:18.184 --> 00:18:19.583
I received a lot from you too.

243
00:18:22.194 --> 00:18:23.253
I'll go now.

244
00:18:26.093 --> 00:18:27.464
My mom's moving to another hospital room.

245
00:18:28.063 --> 00:18:29.763
It was my parents' suggestion.

246
00:18:31.704 --> 00:18:34.333
I saw your script. I'm going to send it to the broadcasting company.

247
00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:36.273
Okay.

248
00:18:59.523 --> 00:19:00.833
Oh, hello.

249
00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:03.333
Hello.

250
00:19:04.063 --> 00:19:06.964
Hyun Soo's not here right now. Didn't you call her before you came?

251
00:19:07.103 --> 00:19:10.273
I thought she'd be here. I need to hurry back anyway.

252
00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:12.174
I came during break time.

253
00:19:14.813 --> 00:19:16.073
What's this?

254
00:19:17.484 --> 00:19:19.043
Thank you for everything.

255
00:19:19.614 --> 00:19:20.714
It's nothing.

256
00:19:36.833 --> 00:19:39.734
I feel uncomfortable with Chef On coming here too often.

257
00:19:40.603 --> 00:19:42.303
Why do you feel uncomfortable?

258
00:19:43.773 --> 00:19:45.773
He's not our son-in-law yet.

259
00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.243
You should tell him in a way that he won't get offended.

260
00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:51.043
What should I tell him?

261
00:19:51.543 --> 00:19:53.384
Tell him that he doesn't need to come.

262
00:19:53.714 --> 00:19:56.253
They're still young. You never know what will happen between them.

263
00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:59.924
What if I tell him that, and he gets upset?

264
00:19:59.924 --> 00:20:01.593
He's been so kind to us.

265
00:20:02.853 --> 00:20:04.793
(Examination Room, Lounge)

266
00:20:29.783 --> 00:20:30.853
Thank you.

267
00:20:32.384 --> 00:20:34.724
- These mandarins are delicious. - Thank you.

268
00:20:35.624 --> 00:20:38.023
Thank you for making time to visit when you're busy.

269
00:20:40.424 --> 00:20:42.493
There's no need for you to feel uncomfortable.

270
00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:20.773
Mr. Park, you have an appointment with Mr. Yoo at 7pm.

271
00:21:31.543 --> 00:21:32.543
Hyun Soo.

272
00:21:33.013 --> 00:21:34.053
Hey.

273
00:21:34.884 --> 00:21:36.813
- Hello. - Hi.

274
00:21:38.984 --> 00:21:40.253
Are you guys on a date?

275
00:21:41.553 --> 00:21:43.394
We agreed to try seeing each other for a month.

276
00:21:47.164 --> 00:21:49.364
I guess you like things to be clear in relationships.

277
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:50.934
Yes.

278
00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:53.364
Didn't you call Jung Sun before coming?

279
00:21:53.874 --> 00:21:55.634
I thought he'd be here.

280
00:21:57.103 --> 00:21:58.103
Did Hong Ah...

281
00:22:01.214 --> 00:22:02.573
I'll go inside first.

282
00:22:07.853 --> 00:22:09.053
Did Hong Ah say something to you?

283
00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:12.384
No. But I'm quite surprised.

284
00:22:12.724 --> 00:22:14.293
I never thought you'd change.

285
00:22:15.093 --> 00:22:16.253
Neither did I.

286
00:22:16.694 --> 00:22:18.023
And I'm still not sure.

287
00:22:18.364 --> 00:22:21.134
But I just decided to give it a go...

288
00:22:21.533 --> 00:22:22.793
since I got swayed a little.

289
00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:28.134
Before, I thought I needed to be at least 80 percent sure to know.

290
00:22:29.773 --> 00:22:31.204
But Soo Jung broke that concept for me.

291
00:22:32.174 --> 00:22:34.374
Are you saying you're uncertain about her, yet you're seeing her?

292
00:22:35.674 --> 00:22:37.444
Soo Jung will be upset to hear that.

293
00:22:37.843 --> 00:22:39.114
That's why I'm trying my best.

294
00:22:39.843 --> 00:22:41.454
There's nothing that won't work with effort.

295
00:23:23.523 --> 00:23:25.724
I went to the hospital to visit your parents.

296
00:23:26.823 --> 00:23:28.434
I went to Good Soup.

297
00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:30.394
We must've crossed paths.

298
00:23:31.464 --> 00:23:32.664
Yes, we did.

299
00:23:33.634 --> 00:23:35.404
I heard your mother's getting discharged next week.

300
00:23:36.503 --> 00:23:38.543
Yes, I think so.

301
00:23:38.944 --> 00:23:40.103
I'll go see her until then.

302
00:23:41.043 --> 00:23:43.073
You don't have to. You already did enough.

303
00:23:44.783 --> 00:23:46.043
Do you know that...

304
00:23:46.984 --> 00:23:49.083
all we do is check up on each other these days?

305
00:23:50.954 --> 00:23:53.424
Mr. Park the one who arranged my mom's surgery.

306
00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:57.023
I couldn't tell you because I thought you might get upset.

307
00:23:57.364 --> 00:23:58.523
Where did...

308
00:23:58.523 --> 00:24:01.263
the straightforward and outspoken Lee Hyun Soo go?

309
00:24:01.263 --> 00:24:02.263
I don't know.

310
00:24:03.664 --> 00:24:06.103
I feel uneasy every time I try to start a conversation with you.

311
00:24:08.404 --> 00:24:09.533
Since when?

312
00:24:10.174 --> 00:24:11.444
It's been a while.

313
00:24:14.444 --> 00:24:17.073
I think it started when you rejected my offer to live together.

314
00:24:18.283 --> 00:24:19.484
It felt as if...

315
00:24:20.283 --> 00:24:23.714
you were pushing me away because of your emotional scars and reality.

316
00:24:24.283 --> 00:24:26.224
I was also worried that...

317
00:24:26.783 --> 00:24:29.194
I became less attractive because I asked you to live with me.

318
00:24:29.454 --> 00:24:31.164
- Hyun Soo. - I tried.

319
00:24:31.164 --> 00:24:32.464
I kept trying.

320
00:24:35.394 --> 00:24:37.093
But I keep feeling like there's a wall between us.

321
00:24:49.914 --> 00:24:51.684
I thought you didn't like humans.

322
00:24:51.843 --> 00:24:53.714
You said social media was your friend.

323
00:24:54.253 --> 00:24:56.114
You acted as if you were never going to see me again.

324
00:24:56.313 --> 00:24:57.924
Why are you following me to my interview?

325
00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:01.154
I also need to gather information about chefs.

326
00:25:01.654 --> 00:25:04.263
Then you should ask Won Joon.

327
00:25:05.894 --> 00:25:08.364
Is he not talking to you anymore because of Soo Jung?

328
00:25:08.493 --> 00:25:10.234
Soo Jung's nothing.

329
00:25:10.603 --> 00:25:12.164
He spent way more time with me.

330
00:25:12.464 --> 00:25:16.103
That doesn't stop elderly couples from getting a divorce.

331
00:25:17.033 --> 00:25:18.803
You're being really annoying.

332
00:25:18.803 --> 00:25:20.813
Yes. I learned this from you.

333
00:25:26.513 --> 00:25:28.114
Have you tried going to...

334
00:25:28.114 --> 00:25:30.484
the new fine dining restaurant that recently opened in Seocho-dong?

335
00:25:30.783 --> 00:25:31.823
No, not yet.

336
00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:33.583
Would you like to go with me?

337
00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:35.593
Yes, I'd love to.

338
00:25:36.454 --> 00:25:37.523
Okay, then.

339
00:25:40.023 --> 00:25:41.134
Hello.

340
00:25:41.434 --> 00:25:42.434
You're here.

341
00:25:42.763 --> 00:25:45.063
Yes. Is Min Ho inside?

342
00:25:45.734 --> 00:25:47.033
He's probably in the kitchen.

343
00:25:47.204 --> 00:25:48.803
I'm going to eat here.

344
00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:51.343
- Kyung, you should eat too. - Okay.

345
00:25:51.474 --> 00:25:53.174
Please reserve a table for us.

346
00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:54.614
Okay.

347
00:25:55.474 --> 00:25:57.813
Won Joon, I need to interview you.

348
00:25:58.384 --> 00:25:59.614
Please stay here, and answer my questions.

349
00:26:00.144 --> 00:26:01.154
Okay.

350
00:26:02.753 --> 00:26:05.283
Soo Jung, let's go home together.

351
00:26:06.384 --> 00:26:07.394
Okay.

352
00:26:17.303 --> 00:26:19.404
Are you happy that you quit being a doctor to become a chef?

353
00:26:19.864 --> 00:26:22.773
If you hadn't quit, you would've actually become a doctor by now.

354
00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:23.843
I like cooking.

355
00:26:24.404 --> 00:26:27.874
I heard your father's still so angry because of you.

356
00:26:28.073 --> 00:26:29.144
How can you say that?

357
00:26:29.144 --> 00:26:31.013
He started to pick up my calls recently.

358
00:26:31.013 --> 00:26:33.013
It's natural for a parent to answer their child's phone call.

359
00:26:33.013 --> 00:26:34.184
That's not something to be happy about.

360
00:26:34.184 --> 00:26:37.424
I'm grateful that I can be happy over such little things.

361
00:26:38.753 --> 00:26:40.484
Why do you keep talking back to every word I say?

362
00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:41.523
I thought this was an interview.

363
00:26:42.124 --> 00:26:43.154
Should I not talk?

364
00:26:43.864 --> 00:26:44.864
You can talk.

365
00:26:46.894 --> 00:26:48.063
How much do you earn a month?

366
00:26:48.063 --> 00:26:49.063
2,500 dollars.

367
00:26:49.063 --> 00:26:50.063
You earn that little?

368
00:26:50.063 --> 00:26:52.364
How is that little? That's just enough for me.

369
00:26:52.364 --> 00:26:54.833
I'll earn more when I'm a chef and make my own menus.

370
00:26:55.003 --> 00:26:57.644
There's nothing grand or special about fine dining.

371
00:26:57.644 --> 00:26:58.803
Why do you want to do this so much?

372
00:26:58.803 --> 00:27:02.614
What about you? What made you so eager to become a scriptwriter?

373
00:27:04.884 --> 00:27:06.843
- Won Joon. - What?

374
00:27:07.353 --> 00:27:08.553
Don't be like this.

375
00:27:08.984 --> 00:27:10.353
I'm sorry.

376
00:27:11.353 --> 00:27:14.523
It's true that I'm starting to show interest in you because of Soo Jung.

377
00:27:14.894 --> 00:27:16.954
But we can't start dating each other because of that.

378
00:27:17.563 --> 00:27:18.664
I never asked you to date me.

379
00:27:18.664 --> 00:27:20.293
I'm telling you not to go out with Soo Jung.

380
00:27:20.593 --> 00:27:22.033
You don't have to go out with me either.

381
00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:24.364
I would hesitate even if you asked me to date you.

382
00:27:24.664 --> 00:27:25.704
Won Joon.

383
00:27:28.434 --> 00:27:29.533
Won Joon.

384
00:27:38.114 --> 00:27:39.144
Mr. Park.

385
00:27:39.414 --> 00:27:40.783
It's been a while, Mr. Yoo.

386
00:27:41.253 --> 00:27:42.714
We should meet each other more often.

387
00:27:42.714 --> 00:27:44.853
I'd love to. Please sit down.

388
00:27:47.593 --> 00:27:50.093
Let's start with the good news.

389
00:27:51.063 --> 00:27:53.224
I read Hyun Soo's synopsis and script.

390
00:27:53.364 --> 00:27:55.634
Things will only become definite after we hand in a proposal.

391
00:27:55.993 --> 00:27:57.033
But I like it.

392
00:27:57.533 --> 00:27:59.934
Joon Ha's also very eager about it, so I'm going to ask him to direct.

393
00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:01.503
Thank you.

394
00:28:07.614 --> 00:28:10.013
Where did the straightforward and outspoken...

395
00:28:10.013 --> 00:28:11.513
Lee Hyun Soo go?

396
00:28:11.513 --> 00:28:12.543
I don't know.

397
00:28:13.914 --> 00:28:16.313
I feel uneasy every time I try to start a conversation with you.

398
00:28:17.924 --> 00:28:19.624
I did that because I care about you.

399
00:28:26.224 --> 00:28:27.694
If you care about me,

400
00:28:31.763 --> 00:28:33.563
give me what I want.

401
00:28:48.553 --> 00:28:50.924
I feel uneasy every time I try to start a conversation with you.

402
00:28:51.884 --> 00:28:53.023
Since when?

403
00:28:53.424 --> 00:28:55.894
I think it started when you rejected my offer to live together.

404
00:29:46.603 --> 00:29:48.243
(3 days later)

405
00:29:48.243 --> 00:29:49.273
(Seowoo Hospital)

406
00:29:55.384 --> 00:29:56.384
I'll carry those.

407
00:29:56.853 --> 00:29:59.323
I'll put these in the car, and I'll meet you in front of the hospital.

408
00:29:59.424 --> 00:30:00.694
Come out after about 10 minutes.

409
00:30:01.293 --> 00:30:02.593
Thank you so much.

410
00:30:03.293 --> 00:30:04.394
Don't mention it.

411
00:30:11.134 --> 00:30:13.404
Why did you call him? We could've just done it ourselves.

412
00:30:13.904 --> 00:30:16.533
He insisted on coming. It's kind of him.

413
00:30:17.174 --> 00:30:18.374
He is kind.

414
00:30:18.803 --> 00:30:21.313
You also got married to Dad because he was kind.

415
00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:24.083
That's because it wasn't a problem to do that back then.

416
00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:27.414
Let's go. He can't park the car for long in front of the hospital.

417
00:30:27.414 --> 00:30:28.414
Okay.

418
00:30:35.293 --> 00:30:36.353
Hello?

419
00:30:36.894 --> 00:30:38.124
You should come to the office by 5pm.

420
00:30:38.293 --> 00:30:40.563
Hong Jin's going to tell you if the drama's going to get aired or not.

421
00:30:49.103 --> 00:30:50.743
- Hello. - Hi, Hyun Soo.

422
00:30:51.103 --> 00:30:53.374
- Have you been doing well? - Yes.

423
00:30:54.674 --> 00:30:56.614
We came to a decision after reading the drama proposal.

424
00:30:57.073 --> 00:30:58.083
We decided to...

425
00:30:58.944 --> 00:31:00.114
proceed with your drama.

426
00:31:01.154 --> 00:31:03.614
But it's not 100 percent yet. You need to work well with Joon Ha.

427
00:31:04.424 --> 00:31:05.823
I'll do my best.

428
00:31:06.654 --> 00:31:09.023
I think you're really lucky when it comes to work.

429
00:31:09.224 --> 00:31:11.424
Mr. Park always steps in to help...

430
00:31:11.424 --> 00:31:12.993
when it comes to things that are related to you.

431
00:31:13.424 --> 00:31:16.164
There's even a rumor that you two are going out.

432
00:31:17.204 --> 00:31:18.404
It was Mr. Park...

433
00:31:19.134 --> 00:31:22.374
who brought Shin Ha Rim back to the filming set.

434
00:31:26.603 --> 00:31:29.114
Hyun Soo. Did you hear the news?

435
00:31:31.484 --> 00:31:32.484
Gosh, it's hot.

436
00:31:39.253 --> 00:31:40.894
(Jung Sun)

437
00:31:43.694 --> 00:31:45.493
(Hyun Soo)

438
00:31:51.704 --> 00:31:52.763
Hello?

439
00:31:52.763 --> 00:31:55.603
Jung Sun, guess what happened today.

440
00:31:55.904 --> 00:31:57.644
What happened?

441
00:31:57.644 --> 00:31:58.704
Gosh.

442
00:31:59.704 --> 00:32:00.874
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

443
00:32:01.614 --> 00:32:03.543
- It's okay. - I'm sorry.

444
00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:06.813
"Kind Soup" could get scheduled to air.

445
00:32:08.454 --> 00:32:10.523
Sorry, I missed that. What's up?

446
00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:13.083
Well,

447
00:32:13.724 --> 00:32:16.124
I said "Kind Soup" could be scheduled to air.

448
00:32:17.364 --> 00:32:18.563
That's great.

449
00:32:19.323 --> 00:32:21.394
Yes, it is.

450
00:32:23.093 --> 00:32:24.134
What are you doing today?

451
00:32:25.263 --> 00:32:26.404
I have to work.

452
00:32:27.374 --> 00:32:28.634
Then I'll come see you later.

453
00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:31.003
Okay.

454
00:32:35.174 --> 00:32:36.243
Hyun Soo.

455
00:32:36.944 --> 00:32:37.984
Let's do this!

456
00:32:39.914 --> 00:32:42.614
I don't think we should head straight home tonight.

457
00:32:42.614 --> 00:32:44.523
We need to celebrate together.

458
00:32:44.523 --> 00:32:46.654
- Together? - Yes, together.

459
00:32:52.323 --> 00:32:54.394
Take one each.

460
00:32:54.563 --> 00:32:56.194
Get up everyone.

461
00:32:56.194 --> 00:32:58.204
When I say "Kind Soup", you say "Big hit".

462
00:32:58.204 --> 00:32:59.833
"Kind Soup"!

463
00:32:59.833 --> 00:33:01.634
- Big hit! - Big hit!

464
00:33:09.073 --> 00:33:11.184
You said we could do this on our own.

465
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:13.283
We're doing it.

466
00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:17.353
Hold it up right.

467
00:33:17.884 --> 00:33:20.523
Gosh. Sure, you're the photographer.

468
00:33:21.253 --> 00:33:22.253
What about me?

469
00:33:22.454 --> 00:33:25.124
- You can just stand there. - All right, then.

470
00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:33.404
- Shall we take a group picture? - That sounds great.

471
00:33:33.404 --> 00:33:35.073
- Okay. - You come here.

472
00:33:35.474 --> 00:33:38.273
- Yes. - 1, 2, 3.

473
00:33:39.674 --> 00:33:41.273
Let's get this done with.

474
00:33:41.414 --> 00:33:43.414
2, 3.

475
00:33:44.638 --> 00:33:47.538
(Episode 32 will air shortly.)
