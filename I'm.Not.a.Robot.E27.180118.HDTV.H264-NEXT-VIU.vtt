1
00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.259
Tonight...

2
00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.898
there will be a minimum of 70 meteor showers during an hour.

3
00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:13.898
According to Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute,

4
00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:16.869
the Quadrantid meteor shower will be visible late at night...

5
00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.369
You startled me.

6
00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.369
Why did you stand up?

7
00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.768
I must go to Mount Hwangmae.

8
00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.209
Are you crazy? It's late.

9
00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:27.378
He promised to take me there during the meteor shower.

10
00:00:27.808 --> 00:00:30.878
- Who? - My friend.

11
00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.748
I think...

12
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.149
your friend is with someone else.

13
00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:38.988
Who?

14
00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:57.428
What do you want to say?

15
00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:01.168
What did you want to say so badly?

16
00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:02.868
I'll tell you.

17
00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:05.099
I'll tell you everything.

18
00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.439
I had a lot to say.

19
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.738
I don't know where to start.

20
00:03:11.738 --> 00:03:12.809
Start from the beginning.

21
00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.779
Start from the day you came to my house.

22
00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:19.219
Is there something else...

23
00:03:19.948 --> 00:03:21.289
you're hiding from me?

24
00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.349
I didn't mean to hide it,

25
00:03:25.418 --> 00:03:27.388
but I didn't get a chance to tell you.

26
00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:33.099
You knew that I was human when we first met.

27
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.268
You knew me as Jo Ji A when we first met.

28
00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.969
Jo Ji A made Heart Balls at the young entrepreneur competition.

29
00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:44.839
I met her...

30
00:03:45.578 --> 00:03:47.608
before the final evaluation?

31
00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:50.678
I was President Jo who bought and delivered figures.

32
00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.018
You met that Ji A before.

33
00:03:56.918 --> 00:03:57.958
That's when...

34
00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.418
we first met.

35
00:04:13.138 --> 00:04:15.168
We couldn't find him.

36
00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:17.938
He wasn't home.

37
00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:23.048
We should have followed him and apologized.

38
00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:25.548
It could be the last time.

39
00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:28.849
Will we ever get a chance...

40
00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.858
to apologize to him properly and explain ourselves?

41
00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.159
It'd be nice to get a chance,

42
00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:40.329
but it's up to him to decide.

43
00:04:40.498 --> 00:04:41.928
I hope...

44
00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:44.769
he'll meet us at least once.

45
00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:48.209
Otherwise, I'll cry every time I think about him.

46
00:04:54.308 --> 00:04:57.818
What's tragedy when seen close but comedy when seen from afar?

47
00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:59.949
- Life? - Life.

48
00:05:00.048 --> 00:05:01.488
It's life.

49
00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.188
President Jo?

50
00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:10.428
You're that President Jo?

51
00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.058
No way.

52
00:05:14.498 --> 00:05:17.529
That's impossible. I talked to her on the phone many times.

53
00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.039
I'd rather hire a robot...

54
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.139
than a person like you.

55
00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.738
What makes a robot better than me?

56
00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:25.808
What's that?

57
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.048
You didn't take out the necklace yet.

58
00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:30.748
How...

59
00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.048
How did you know that there's a necklace inside?

60
00:05:37.818 --> 00:05:38.858
Do you...

61
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:41.589
remember now?

62
00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:44.729
If you're telling me the truth,

63
00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:48.168
- didn't I share... - In general,

64
00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:53.238
is touching the lips...

65
00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.738
considered a kiss?

66
00:05:59.378 --> 00:06:01.979
Could it be?

67
00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.219
Did I tell you all that?

68
00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:13.289
Wait a minute.

69
00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.959
This makes no sense.

70
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.099
When Aji 3 was delivered,

71
00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:19.659
I was on the phone with President Jo.

72
00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.998
Right, I was on the phone with you.

73
00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.599
I told you to go see a doctor.

74
00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.139
Aji 3 was in a box.

75
00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.469
I was on the phone in the box.

76
00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:31.508
When the box opened, you were standing in front of me.

77
00:06:31.608 --> 00:06:33.409
I was very startled.

78
00:06:33.878 --> 00:06:34.909
So...

79
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:36.479
My goodness!

80
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.918
I thought you'd find out at that moment.

81
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:44.889
Doctor Hong said...

82
00:06:45.818 --> 00:06:48.258
Friend Mode will turn on.

83
00:06:48.258 --> 00:06:50.589
You believed him.

84
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:51.628
Then...

85
00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:54.628
it never existed?

86
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.899
He made up a lie.

87
00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:58.769
Does that mean...

88
00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:01.438
I'm the fool?

89
00:07:01.568 --> 00:07:04.008
I was surprised that you believed him.

90
00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:11.279
Goodness.

91
00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:13.719
How did I fall for it?

92
00:07:15.248 --> 00:07:17.618
Master, you farted.

93
00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:20.188
- I did? - Yes.

94
00:07:21.488 --> 00:07:24.289
- It wasn't me. - Could it be me?

95
00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:27.058
It can't be you.

96
00:07:27.058 --> 00:07:29.428
What about that fart?

97
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:37.339
No robot would blame others for farting.

98
00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:40.608
Hey.

99
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:43.808
You must have...

100
00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:46.019
thought that...

101
00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:48.248
I was foolish.

102
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:51.789
Tell the truth.

103
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.688
I couldn't believe how foolish you were.

104
00:07:55.428 --> 00:07:57.459
That's enough.

105
00:07:58.258 --> 00:08:00.829
Can you believe me now?

106
00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:03.269
No, I can't.

107
00:08:04.498 --> 00:08:06.899
You may be President Jo,

108
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:11.108
but I can't believe myself for thinking that you were a robot.

109
00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:14.279
I also find it hard to believe.

110
00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:17.248
You're such a creative and smart robot.

111
00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:21.019
You're the first person to call me smart...

112
00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:22.318
That's enough.

113
00:08:26.688 --> 00:08:29.389
Also, my brother didn't know...

114
00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:32.258
that I was doing this.

115
00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:34.329
He isn't like that.

116
00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:37.868
He didn't tell you that Aji 3 looked like me...

117
00:08:37.998 --> 00:08:40.368
for my sake. I promise.

118
00:08:40.368 --> 00:08:41.538
How can I believe that?

119
00:08:41.738 --> 00:08:42.939
If not...

120
00:08:44.238 --> 00:08:45.439
Thank you.

121
00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:52.549
Why would I have had my hair down like that?

122
00:08:55.819 --> 00:08:57.788
I continued to believe you even after that?

123
00:08:59.388 --> 00:09:02.158
Did you call me to confirm that I'm a fool?

124
00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:04.128
You called me.

125
00:09:07.358 --> 00:09:11.199
(Nice Real Estate, Nice Accommodation)

126
00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:24.819
Are you sure Jang Doo Sam lives here?

127
00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.319
Madam X told me that he does.

128
00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:30.189
What? Madam X?

129
00:09:30.189 --> 00:09:31.518
I'm not exactly sure who that is.

130
00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:34.628
I just know that Madam X is an informant.

131
00:09:35.528 --> 00:09:38.799
But do you think you'll be able to convince him?

132
00:09:38.898 --> 00:09:40.028
I need to.

133
00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:42.498
He may be our only hope.

134
00:09:48.508 --> 00:09:49.569
Hey, Pai.

135
00:09:49.569 --> 00:09:52.538
This place is the best out of all the places we've seen.

136
00:09:52.538 --> 00:09:54.748
It also has enough space for Aji 3...

137
00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:58.778
Oh, I forgot that we're going to send her away.

138
00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:00.878
- I'm sorry. - Then sign the contract.

139
00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:03.089
I'm sure you chose the right place.

140
00:10:08.888 --> 00:10:11.799
Sun Hye, please give me an Americano.

141
00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:14.099
Okay.

142
00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:16.329
Did you find a place?

143
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:18.138
I already signed the contract.

144
00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:22.368
We can move in after we send Aji 3 to Chairman Hwang.

145
00:10:24.008 --> 00:10:25.079
But...

146
00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:27.709
did Aji 3 run out of battery?

147
00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:29.679
She kept saying she had to go somewhere.

148
00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:32.018
So I put her on Standby Mode because I got annoyed.

149
00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:35.089
She'll probably get disassembled into pieces...

150
00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:37.388
once Chairman Martin takes her away.

151
00:10:37.858 --> 00:10:41.459
I hope all her parts will end up getting used...

152
00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:44.398
for the benefit of many people.

153
00:10:44.498 --> 00:10:46.059
I'm sorry, Aji 3.

154
00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:48.969
Here's your Americano.

155
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:51.169
Thank you.

156
00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:54.339
Let's all make a wish during the meteor shower.

157
00:10:54.969 --> 00:10:58.079
Who knows? One of our wishes might come true.

158
00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:09.349
Fine. Now that things have ended up this way,

159
00:11:09.349 --> 00:11:10.849
let's tell each other everything.

160
00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:14.059
Tell me. What else did you lie about?

161
00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:17.189
I didn't lie about anything else,

162
00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:20.459
but I did steal something.

163
00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:22.929
You stole something? What did you steal?

164
00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:24.839
Don't get me wrong. It's not what you think.

165
00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:26.368
Are you an onion?

166
00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:28.768
You have so many layers of things you haven't told me.

167
00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:30.868
I stole what you threw away.

168
00:11:30.868 --> 00:11:32.209
What did I throw away?

169
00:11:32.809 --> 00:11:37.408
You once threw away a bunch of food from your refrigerator...

170
00:11:37.408 --> 00:11:40.018
including the Korean beef that was about to go bad the next day.

171
00:11:40.118 --> 00:11:43.148
You took them from the trash can?

172
00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:44.758
They looked delicious.

173
00:11:46.189 --> 00:11:49.329
I also took a little bit of lettuce and alcohol.

174
00:11:51.258 --> 00:11:53.028
My gosh.

175
00:11:53.729 --> 00:11:54.868
Did you just laugh?

176
00:11:57.329 --> 00:11:58.569
How did you hold in...

177
00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:03.138
your hunger? You must've really wanted to eat the food I cooked.

178
00:12:03.768 --> 00:12:06.778
I got to eat the food you cooked at Geoje Island.

179
00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:11.949
Everything was really delicious.

180
00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:18.189
What else is there? Hurry up and tell me.

181
00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:20.258
There's nothing else.

182
00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:23.388
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

183
00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:32.939
Are you really...

184
00:12:33.738 --> 00:12:35.268
sure?

185
00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:36.969
Yes.

186
00:12:40.278 --> 00:12:42.748
Who's Hong Joo?

187
00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:46.479
I have a question.

188
00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:48.449
Yes?

189
00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:50.648
Why...

190
00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:53.788
aren't you angry at me?

191
00:12:54.729 --> 00:12:56.329
I expected you to beat me up a little.

192
00:12:56.858 --> 00:12:59.829
Lawyers always try to think of things in both...

193
00:12:59.829 --> 00:13:01.669
the assailant and the victim's point of view.

194
00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:02.998
That's why I was able to understand.

195
00:13:03.398 --> 00:13:05.398
You guys didn't start off very well,

196
00:13:05.398 --> 00:13:07.498
but I could see that your sincerity...

197
00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:09.508
started to build up with time.

198
00:13:10.108 --> 00:13:13.278
That's why I felt sorry for everyone.

199
00:13:13.878 --> 00:13:16.778
I felt sorry for Director Kim, my sister,

200
00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:18.219
and the Santa Maria Research Team.

201
00:13:20.118 --> 00:13:21.988
But do you know this?

202
00:13:22.288 --> 00:13:26.189
You can feel the other person's sincerity...

203
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:28.628
once that person's caught in a crisis.

204
00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:31.059
I'm trying to say that...

205
00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:34.158
Director Kim isn't the only person...

206
00:13:34.158 --> 00:13:36.929
who has the key to resolve this issue.

207
00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:39.339
If that was the case, that would be too cruel.

208
00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:43.738
Each and every one of you need to take responsibility.

209
00:13:44.778 --> 00:13:48.108
The lawsuit will get filed by the court tomorrow.

210
00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:49.849
Okay.

211
00:13:52.118 --> 00:13:55.748
Okay. Then what did you think of me...

212
00:13:55.988 --> 00:13:57.248
when you...

213
00:13:57.988 --> 00:13:59.358
first met me as a human being?

214
00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:02.028
- You were a nasty jerk. - What?

215
00:14:02.028 --> 00:14:05.729
You left without even giving me the remaining amount of money.

216
00:14:05.729 --> 00:14:08.669
Back then, I didn't even know about your allergy.

217
00:14:08.669 --> 00:14:12.439
But of course, I did realize that I was mistaken...

218
00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:14.138
once I saw the figure box at your house.

219
00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:17.538
- What about after that? - After that,

220
00:14:18.038 --> 00:14:20.079
I thought of you as a crazy psycho.

221
00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:23.608
I mean, I really couldn't help but think that way.

222
00:14:23.608 --> 00:14:25.949
You celebrated your robot vacuum cleaner's birthday.

223
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:28.949
And you told me that there's a rank for every single machine.

224
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:32.319
It was impossible for me to think of you as a normal person.

225
00:14:33.618 --> 00:14:36.288
You told me to only tell you the truth.

226
00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:38.258
Okay, fine.

227
00:14:38.498 --> 00:14:39.628
And then?

228
00:14:40.599 --> 00:14:43.368
But after a certain point,

229
00:14:44.699 --> 00:14:47.738
I suddenly started to feel sorry for you.

230
00:14:50.268 --> 00:14:53.079
I was dumbfounded by...

231
00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:55.309
everything you said at first.

232
00:14:57.719 --> 00:15:02.349
But they all suddenly started to sound sad.

233
00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:09.858
So the more I spent time with you,

234
00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:11.929
and the more I got to know you,

235
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:16.699
I kept feeling sad.

236
00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:20.498
So?

237
00:15:21.038 --> 00:15:22.209
So...

238
00:15:23.469 --> 00:15:26.108
I started to wish for your happiness.

239
00:15:28.608 --> 00:15:29.778
So?

240
00:15:30.908 --> 00:15:33.419
I wanted to do everything I could...

241
00:15:34.349 --> 00:15:37.988
in order to make you become happy.

242
00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:46.799
I can't hear you because you have a small voice.

243
00:15:49.498 --> 00:15:50.799
Come next to me.

244
00:15:59.823 --> 00:16:04.823
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E27 I'm Not a Robot "I Really Need You"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

245
00:16:13.518 --> 00:16:14.858
Tell me everything again...

246
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:17.488
from the start.

247
00:16:27.768 --> 00:16:32.508
You don't need to get married to Min Kyu as you wished.

248
00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:34.908
I couldn't force you to get married to someone you didn't want to.

249
00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:37.479
Are you serious?

250
00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:41.949
Min Kyu's probably going to have to resign from KM Financial.

251
00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:45.459
Then, Yoo Cheol will get to come back.

252
00:16:46.788 --> 00:16:50.429
You're better off with Yoo Cheol than Min Kyu anyway.

253
00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:52.229
Yoo Cheol?

254
00:16:52.229 --> 00:16:54.799
Why are you suddenly mentioning Yoo Cheol?

255
00:16:55.329 --> 00:16:58.599
We're expecting some guests. I want you to welcome them.

256
00:17:04.778 --> 00:17:07.439
My goodness. Ri El, it's been so long.

257
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.649
- Hello, Chairman Hwang. - Don't call me that.

258
00:17:09.649 --> 00:17:12.879
You can just call me Mr. Hwang when we're outside the company.

259
00:17:13.149 --> 00:17:16.449
No, wait. You'll be calling me your father-in-law soon.

260
00:17:16.649 --> 00:17:17.758
Pardon?

261
00:17:17.758 --> 00:17:20.558
Let's talk while we eat.

262
00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:22.258
- Oh, sure. - Okay.

263
00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.998
I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

264
00:17:36.038 --> 00:17:37.209
Ri El.

265
00:17:39.109 --> 00:17:41.449
- Wait. - Shut it. Don't say anything.

266
00:17:44.248 --> 00:17:45.719
You're just as bad.

267
00:17:45.719 --> 00:17:48.719
I didn't know. I didn't know anything about this.

268
00:17:48.719 --> 00:17:50.818
I can't trust you anymore.

269
00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:54.258
I'm not even sure if you're still...

270
00:17:55.788 --> 00:17:57.429
the Hwang Yoo Cheol that I used to know.

271
00:18:06.568 --> 00:18:08.568
Apart from feeling sorry for me,

272
00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:14.649
has your heart ever fluttered because of me?

273
00:18:16.949 --> 00:18:18.778
It's really nothing.

274
00:18:19.278 --> 00:18:21.088
There's nothing special about it.

275
00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:24.788
Just tell me everything.

276
00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:27.588
I want to know everything...

277
00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:30.189
I didn't know while I was with you.

278
00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:38.998
My heart fluttered...

279
00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:42.469
every morning on my way to your house.

280
00:18:46.508 --> 00:18:49.278
When you told me that I was your treasure...

281
00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:52.078
and asked me to stay with you forever,

282
00:18:53.179 --> 00:18:57.288
it kind of felt as if you were proposing to me.

283
00:18:58.518 --> 00:18:59.788
And when you cut yourself...

284
00:18:59.788 --> 00:19:01.659
- just so you could protect me... - Did you cut yourself?

285
00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:04.459
Why are you cooking so aggressively?

286
00:19:04.899 --> 00:19:07.528
It was like you were a knight.

287
00:19:08.729 --> 00:19:12.639
I saved you when you had an outbreak.

288
00:19:13.399 --> 00:19:14.409
Then...

289
00:19:17.508 --> 00:19:23.078
I thought, "Gosh, I can't believe there's a guy who smiles like this."

290
00:19:26.449 --> 00:19:27.479
Back then...

291
00:19:28.748 --> 00:19:29.919
Weren't you scared?

292
00:19:31.189 --> 00:19:34.189
To be honest, I was scared.

293
00:19:36.558 --> 00:19:39.359
But I remembered something you'd said.

294
00:19:40.629 --> 00:19:42.828
However I change,

295
00:19:44.838 --> 00:19:45.869
I hope...

296
00:19:46.738 --> 00:19:48.439
you will recognize me.

297
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:55.078
That's when I realized how desperately sincere...

298
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:57.609
you actually were.

299
00:20:05.719 --> 00:20:06.788
What else?

300
00:20:09.828 --> 00:20:12.258
Each time you stroked my head,

301
00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:14.699
I felt happy and excited.

302
00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:17.429
Guess what?

303
00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:20.469
I really didn't like it at first.

304
00:20:21.508 --> 00:20:23.568
But then I got used to it,

305
00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:27.038
and I got upset when you wouldn't stroke me.

306
00:20:28.109 --> 00:20:29.179
What else?

307
00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:32.479
That day,

308
00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:35.318
when you got drunk...

309
00:20:35.988 --> 00:20:39.018
and said you wished I were human.

310
00:20:39.258 --> 00:20:40.689
Fold a finger...

311
00:20:42.288 --> 00:20:46.229
if you wished that robot were human.

312
00:20:47.869 --> 00:20:48.929
I thought...

313
00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:52.639
my heart would explode.

314
00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.308
I felt so sorry...

315
00:20:58.709 --> 00:20:59.879
and happy.

316
00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:07.988
That's why I leaned in close to you and said this.

317
00:21:16.828 --> 00:21:17.899
I'm...

318
00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:21.869
not a robot.

319
00:22:21.088 --> 00:22:22.189
How pretty.

320
00:22:24.058 --> 00:22:25.459
You're prettier.

321
00:22:48.748 --> 00:22:49.748
We're...

322
00:22:50.548 --> 00:22:52.588
a nuisance, aren't we?

323
00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:54.488
Sorry.

324
00:22:54.788 --> 00:22:57.798
We'll get out of your way when we move in a few days.

325
00:22:59.098 --> 00:23:01.899
It's fine. It's like the cafe's bustling with customers.

326
00:23:02.828 --> 00:23:04.199
Did you...

327
00:23:05.469 --> 00:23:07.639
always have curly hair?

328
00:23:07.768 --> 00:23:10.209
Yes, it's genetic.

329
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:11.439
You're pretty now,

330
00:23:11.439 --> 00:23:15.709
but you'd look much nicer with straighter hair.

331
00:23:16.078 --> 00:23:17.609
I feel so sorry for you.

332
00:23:22.389 --> 00:23:25.018
I heard you had many boyfriends.

333
00:23:25.018 --> 00:23:27.419
Why don't you have one now?

334
00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:29.659
I have a chronic disease.

335
00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:34.229
At first, I hold onto the guy because he shines like a star.

336
00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:38.268
But then I look into my hand and see he's just a rock.

337
00:23:40.498 --> 00:23:42.439
All my relationships were like that.

338
00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:45.909
They say the first humans were made of atomic dust.

339
00:23:46.038 --> 00:23:49.808
Why look for a star outside when they're inside you?

340
00:23:54.018 --> 00:23:56.689
- Shall we date? - Yes. Wait, what?

341
00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:05.429
Your answer?

342
00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:06.929
Stars.

343
00:24:08.328 --> 00:24:09.929
If that's what you want.

344
00:24:13.139 --> 00:24:14.538
Ears, ears.

345
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:16.709
Sleep.

346
00:24:23.008 --> 00:24:24.179
So...

347
00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:26.479
when you reset me,

348
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:30.949
I couldn't say anything to you.

349
00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:35.558
I couldn't tell you the truth.

350
00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.828
I felt terrible.

351
00:24:44.369 --> 00:24:45.399
Was it...

352
00:24:47.768 --> 00:24:48.869
very hard?

353
00:24:52.738 --> 00:24:54.278
It was bearable.

354
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:59.179
I liked being able to see you.

355
00:25:02.449 --> 00:25:05.088
I liked it that you looked at me.

356
00:25:07.889 --> 00:25:12.028
I paid the price for forgetting that I was deceiving you.

357
00:25:13.828 --> 00:25:14.899
Back then,

358
00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:18.399
when you followed me to Geoje Island,

359
00:25:20.498 --> 00:25:22.969
I'm really sorry I pretended not to know you.

360
00:25:27.078 --> 00:25:29.109
When you called out to me...

361
00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:30.109
Hi.

362
00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:33.818
Aji 3.

363
00:25:35.788 --> 00:25:39.058
I thought my heart fell to the floor.

364
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:45.229
That night, in the warehouse,

365
00:25:48.568 --> 00:25:51.068
I was so worried that you'd...

366
00:25:51.068 --> 00:25:53.068
find out and have an outbreak.

367
00:25:56.538 --> 00:25:58.679
But I got to see your face...

368
00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:03.508
and hear your voice.

369
00:26:05.879 --> 00:26:07.719
That made me so happy.

370
00:26:11.788 --> 00:26:15.729
I really didn't want time to keep on going.

371
00:26:23.098 --> 00:26:25.838
I should've told you the truth then.

372
00:26:29.469 --> 00:26:30.869
I'm really sorry.

373
00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:27.159
I'm right here.

374
00:27:28.768 --> 00:27:29.998
What...

375
00:27:30.768 --> 00:27:33.598
I really wanted to say to you,

376
00:27:34.709 --> 00:27:35.969
I'll say now.

377
00:27:37.068 --> 00:27:38.109
That day,

378
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:40.679
the day it rained.

379
00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:46.078
The day you held an umbrella over me.

380
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:51.758
- The day I kissed... - Stop.

381
00:27:55.288 --> 00:27:56.629
The best gift...

382
00:27:57.828 --> 00:27:58.998
should be put aside.

383
00:28:00.498 --> 00:28:01.528
I want to...

384
00:28:02.298 --> 00:28:05.439
keep that one unopened.

385
00:28:23.518 --> 00:28:24.588
Thank you...

386
00:28:25.258 --> 00:28:26.659
for being truthful.

387
00:28:27.488 --> 00:28:30.558
For telling me everything I wanted to know and...

388
00:28:32.098 --> 00:28:33.758
for making the time...

389
00:28:35.068 --> 00:28:36.629
that we shared together...

390
00:28:37.699 --> 00:28:41.969
a beautiful memory that I can cherish forever.

391
00:28:44.609 --> 00:28:45.879
With those memories,

392
00:28:47.078 --> 00:28:48.179
I think I can...

393
00:28:51.348 --> 00:28:52.719
get through...

394
00:28:54.278 --> 00:28:56.189
the rest of my life.

395
00:29:01.558 --> 00:29:04.288
What do you mean by that?

396
00:29:05.328 --> 00:29:08.798
I should get back to where I was before.

397
00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:11.598
What do you mean?

398
00:29:13.068 --> 00:29:14.439
Perhaps...

399
00:29:15.109 --> 00:29:16.508
I may never...

400
00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:19.578
be able to touch you.

401
00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:23.109
I endured it...

402
00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:26.449
during the last 15 years. I can't put you through it too.

403
00:29:27.748 --> 00:29:28.848
So...

404
00:29:31.088 --> 00:29:32.159
this is...

405
00:29:33.518 --> 00:29:34.889
the end for us.

406
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:46.098
I can't watch the meteor showers with you.

407
00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:47.738
Otherwise,

408
00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:51.709
the memory will be emotionally unbearable.

409
00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:54.078
Therefore,

410
00:29:57.109 --> 00:29:58.848
our time together...

411
00:30:01.018 --> 00:30:02.149
is over.

412
00:30:06.859 --> 00:30:08.028
Goodbye.

413
00:30:09.058 --> 00:30:10.189
Aji 3.

414
00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:14.028
Goodbye.

415
00:30:16.129 --> 00:30:17.268
Ji A.

416
00:30:26.479 --> 00:30:28.609
How can you leave like this?

417
00:30:28.709 --> 00:30:30.008
Stop right there.

418
00:30:32.419 --> 00:30:35.419
The one who gave me the love I ever wanted...

419
00:30:35.988 --> 00:30:37.719
was you.

420
00:30:38.318 --> 00:30:40.988
The one whom I miss every day...

421
00:30:40.988 --> 00:30:42.889
is you.

422
00:30:51.098 --> 00:30:53.899
It's not because you need me.

423
00:30:54.808 --> 00:30:58.008
I really need you.

424
00:30:59.578 --> 00:31:01.248
It's because...

425
00:31:03.679 --> 00:31:05.979
you're the one...

426
00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:10.988
I've been looking and waiting for all my life.

427
00:31:13.018 --> 00:31:14.429
You don't know, do you?

428
00:31:15.429 --> 00:31:18.899
This is what I really wanted to tell you before the reset.

429
00:31:22.998 --> 00:31:24.199
I love you.

430
00:32:54.488 --> 00:32:57.729
We missed the meteor shower.

431
00:32:58.659 --> 00:33:00.229
I wanted to make a wish.

432
00:33:02.598 --> 00:33:03.768
My wish...

433
00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:07.598
just came true.

434
00:33:09.538 --> 00:33:10.969
What was it?

435
00:33:32.194 --> 00:33:34.994
(Episode 28 will air shortly.)
