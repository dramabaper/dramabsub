1
00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:13.132
- What? - What?

2
00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.632
No. Hold on.

3
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.632
I'm still inside!

4
00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:22.443
Excuse me! There's someone inside!

5
00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:27.983
There's someone inside!

6
00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:31.783
Excuse me!

7
00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:41.592
My gosh, did I seriously get locked up in this storage room with him?

8
00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:43.592
This can't be.

9
00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:48.163
I'll either suffocate to death or freeze before morning comes.

10
00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:54.873
Don't worry. Trust me.

11
00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:57.943
I'll make sure that we get out no matter what.

12
00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:01.712
If we don't, I'll lose my mind.

13
00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.982
Help will come once I make a call.

14
00:01:06.982 --> 00:01:08.122
One moment.

15
00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:11.492
There's no reception.

16
00:01:13.022 --> 00:01:14.022
Come on.

17
00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:17.462
Come on.

18
00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:20.503
Please work.

19
00:01:21.932 --> 00:01:22.962
Please.

20
00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:27.843
There's no reception.

21
00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:32.542
Don't worry. I know how to survive on the street.

22
00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:34.343
Trust me.

23
00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:49.393
Oh, right.

24
00:01:50.863 --> 00:01:52.462
If I leave the lights on,

25
00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:54.732
people will know that someone is inside.

26
00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:57.402
Then someone will come...

27
00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:06.872
Don't be scared.

28
00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:09.582
I can see easily in the dark.

29
00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:13.922
You won't stay locked up until tomorrow morning.

30
00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:15.653
It's okay.

31
00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:18.023
I'm used to being locked up.

32
00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:23.292
I'm also used to the cold.

33
00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:32.003
This is terrible.

34
00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:34.903
Can it get worse than this?

35
00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:38.873
You must have indigestion.

36
00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:42.813
You ate a lot of sashimi after all.

37
00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:43.882
That wasn't me.

38
00:02:44.012 --> 00:02:45.452
Was it me?

39
00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:51.952
It's me.

40
00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:55.663
I didn't have lunch nor dinner.

41
00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:07.142
The number you have dialed is not available.

42
00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:10.443
Ji A isn't picking up.

43
00:03:10.443 --> 00:03:12.373
I can't get in touch with Min Kyu's phone.

44
00:03:14.112 --> 00:03:15.343
It's getting worse.

45
00:03:16.243 --> 00:03:17.452
Go inside. It's cold.

46
00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:20.082
It's okay. I'll fix it with you.

47
00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:21.822
You'll catch a cold.

48
00:03:21.822 --> 00:03:23.283
I'll be fine.

49
00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:25.322
Listen to me.

50
00:03:25.523 --> 00:03:27.193
I can't concentrate if you're next to me.

51
00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:28.322
I can't do anything. Go inside.

52
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.193
It's because you're tired.

53
00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:32.533
Get some rest in the car.

54
00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:36.463
- We don't have time. - A little rest won't kill you.

55
00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:40.273
If you stay tired and drive, you might kill us later.

56
00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:44.243
Okay.

57
00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:45.572
I'll go inside.

58
00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:16.142
Let's find something to keep us warm while we wait for someone to come.

59
00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:19.942
There should be something to cover us.

60
00:04:21.013 --> 00:04:22.013
Okay.

61
00:04:27.552 --> 00:04:29.122
I found it.

62
00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:35.763
These are thick, and there are a lot.

63
00:04:36.263 --> 00:04:37.932
We won't freeze to death.

64
00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:41.562
Wait, wait. You're saying we'll...

65
00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:44.203
cover ourselves with those?

66
00:04:44.203 --> 00:04:46.672
Use the straw as mats and the sacks as covers.

67
00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:49.302
They make pretty decent bedding.

68
00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:53.343
Wait to one side while I set things up.

69
00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:54.383
Okay.

70
00:04:55.742 --> 00:04:56.783
There.

71
00:04:58.153 --> 00:04:59.482
Let me see.

72
00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.153
Hey.

73
00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:11.833
What are you doing? Let go, I'm fine.

74
00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:14.263
You got a splinter.

75
00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:15.562
I know.

76
00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:17.502
It'll sink deeper inside.

77
00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:22.302
What's your credit card for?

78
00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:45.833
There.

79
00:05:46.932 --> 00:05:48.002
It came out.

80
00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:14.463
Are you okay?

81
00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:16.163
About what?

82
00:06:18.362 --> 00:06:19.562
You wanted to...

83
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.203
get back together with Ji A.

84
00:06:24.403 --> 00:06:26.602
When you found out that...

85
00:06:26.602 --> 00:06:28.942
Ji A and Min Kyu love each other,

86
00:06:30.002 --> 00:06:32.143
how did you feel?

87
00:06:33.473 --> 00:06:35.083
When Min Kyu...

88
00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:37.682
failed to input what he wanted into Aji 3,

89
00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:42.552
I felt the despair that he might have felt.

90
00:06:44.492 --> 00:06:45.792
Now,

91
00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.093
I cannot find the Ji A I knew.

92
00:06:51.393 --> 00:06:52.792
Whatever I said,

93
00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:56.963
she would smile and cheer me on.

94
00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:00.203
She's gone for good.

95
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:04.843
I realized why we'd broken up,

96
00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:08.283
and I wanted to make up for my mistakes.

97
00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:13.383
But Ji A was no longer the same Ji A,

98
00:07:15.752 --> 00:07:17.393
and I wasn't the same as well.

99
00:07:19.792 --> 00:07:21.422
There's no going back.

100
00:07:23.963 --> 00:07:25.192
It's irreversible.

101
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:27.963
That's so sad.

102
00:07:34.802 --> 00:07:36.203
Doesn't it hurt?

103
00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:38.573
It does.

104
00:07:39.812 --> 00:07:41.013
It hurts.

105
00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:43.213
But...

106
00:07:44.312 --> 00:07:46.352
compared to the pain they feel,

107
00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:48.922
it's nothing.

108
00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:58.292
I'm standing right here

109
00:07:58.292 --> 00:08:01.133
My love protects you always

110
00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:02.203
That's nice.

111
00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:04.172
I'm standing right here

112
00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:06.672
Let's rest until the song's over.

113
00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:14.383
If you'd just look to your side

114
00:08:14.383 --> 00:08:16.883
Then you would see me

115
00:08:16.883 --> 00:08:20.453
Why don't you see it?

116
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:25.153
Can't you smile at me that way?

117
00:08:25.153 --> 00:08:28.422
Climb up. That's your bed for tonight.

118
00:08:28.823 --> 00:08:31.292
What about you? There's only one.

119
00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:34.233
I can... I can exercise.

120
00:08:34.233 --> 00:08:35.863
I'll do jumping jacks.

121
00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:39.072
You'll do jumping jacks at night?

122
00:08:39.072 --> 00:08:42.003
Does he want me to lie beside him there?

123
00:08:42.003 --> 00:08:44.172
And die of a heart explosion?

124
00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:46.743
Exercising is...

125
00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:49.842
the best way to stay warm on a cold night.

126
00:08:49.842 --> 00:08:51.653
I'll stay up all night.

127
00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:54.182
You can climb up and get some sleep.

128
00:09:12.873 --> 00:09:14.873
Hong Joo, come here.

129
00:09:17.472 --> 00:09:19.212
There's a heater.

130
00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:21.812
We won't freeze to death.

131
00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:22.883
And...

132
00:09:27.822 --> 00:09:30.383
Dried anchovies, makgeolli, and ramyun.

133
00:09:31.123 --> 00:09:32.822
This is amazing.

134
00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:36.722
Don't these belong to someone?

135
00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.062
Can we eat these?

136
00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:40.832
We can and then replenish the stock.

137
00:09:40.832 --> 00:09:43.663
Then shall we just have a taste?

138
00:09:58.853 --> 00:09:59.952
Here.

139
00:10:03.153 --> 00:10:04.853
From the sound you made earlier,

140
00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:07.822
we could eat everything here,

141
00:10:07.822 --> 00:10:11.932
and it would still not be enough for you.

142
00:10:50.972 --> 00:10:53.172
Can't you stop looking?

143
00:10:53.172 --> 00:10:54.342
It's so strange.

144
00:10:55.003 --> 00:10:56.773
That I look so much like her?

145
00:10:57.143 --> 00:10:58.143
No.

146
00:10:59.172 --> 00:11:01.312
Then what's so strange?

147
00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:06.153
You said you're cold, you're hungry,

148
00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:09.153
we ate cup noodles together, and drank rice wine.

149
00:11:10.082 --> 00:11:13.962
Everything I wanted to hear and see Aji 3 do,

150
00:11:13.962 --> 00:11:16.722
you're doing it right now.

151
00:11:24.472 --> 00:11:25.702
Of course.

152
00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:27.903
I'm a human.

153
00:11:28.743 --> 00:11:30.972
How old are you? I'm 28...

154
00:11:30.972 --> 00:11:33.572
No, I'm not. I'm 29 now.

155
00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:36.342
Same.

156
00:11:37.082 --> 00:11:39.582
- Same? - We're the same age.

157
00:11:39.582 --> 00:11:41.883
Shall we be friends?

158
00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:44.523
No.

159
00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:46.493
Why not?

160
00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:48.722
Would you want to be?

161
00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:53.462
Why won't you ask me my name?

162
00:11:55.462 --> 00:11:56.932
I know yours, Hong Joo.

163
00:11:58.273 --> 00:12:00.702
I don't want to know your name.

164
00:12:02.403 --> 00:12:05.842
Kim Min Kyu. I'm not just a customer or a guest.

165
00:12:05.842 --> 00:12:07.013
I'm Kim Min Kyu.

166
00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:10.113
So...

167
00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:16.883
If you won't drink that, I will.

168
00:12:16.883 --> 00:12:17.922
No.

169
00:12:22.163 --> 00:12:24.763
Why did you follow me and get locked in?

170
00:12:27.302 --> 00:12:28.503
I like it.

171
00:12:29.533 --> 00:12:30.603
Like what?

172
00:12:31.873 --> 00:12:33.302
This situation.

173
00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:35.503
Everything.

174
00:12:40.373 --> 00:12:41.712
What you just said.

175
00:12:42.383 --> 00:12:46.113
Your girlfriend would get the wrong idea if she heard it.

176
00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:50.952
I don't have a girlfriend.

177
00:12:55.722 --> 00:12:56.792
Anyway,

178
00:12:57.763 --> 00:12:59.832
this rice wine's really good.

179
00:13:05.932 --> 00:13:06.972
What?

180
00:13:07.503 --> 00:13:09.873
The headlights went out.

181
00:13:22.897 --> 00:13:27.897
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E23 I'm Not a Robot "The Truth"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

182
00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:40.302
Is it raining?

183
00:13:40.942 --> 00:13:44.442
Those are the waves. And the wind.

184
00:13:47.042 --> 00:13:48.613
It sounds like the rain.

185
00:13:50.452 --> 00:13:52.883
Do you like rain?

186
00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:56.023
I have an unforgettable memory.

187
00:13:57.452 --> 00:13:58.653
On a rainy day,

188
00:13:59.993 --> 00:14:01.322
I had my first kiss.

189
00:14:05.163 --> 00:14:06.263
I want to...

190
00:14:06.893 --> 00:14:09.603
talk to you about Aji 3 a bit more.

191
00:14:09.603 --> 00:14:12.873
If you don't feel too uncomfortable,

192
00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:16.143
would you just listen to me talk?

193
00:14:20.483 --> 00:14:24.113
I've never talked to anyone about her properly.

194
00:14:24.283 --> 00:14:25.312
That's because...

195
00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:28.483
the things I shared with her...

196
00:14:28.483 --> 00:14:32.192
are really hard to explain in words.

197
00:14:32.952 --> 00:14:35.763
So it's quite hard for anyone to actually understand.

198
00:14:36.163 --> 00:14:37.192
But...

199
00:14:38.493 --> 00:14:39.533
I want to...

200
00:14:40.332 --> 00:14:41.403
talk to you about her.

201
00:14:46.832 --> 00:14:47.903
But I won't...

202
00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:50.773
if you don't want me to.

203
00:14:53.983 --> 00:14:55.513
I'll let you tell me...

204
00:14:57.153 --> 00:14:59.783
if you promise me that you'll stop bothering me starting from tomorrow.

205
00:15:02.082 --> 00:15:05.523
I honestly feel uncomfortable being around you.

206
00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:10.633
I promise.

207
00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:14.263
Instead, will you please ask me questions about Aji 3?

208
00:15:14.432 --> 00:15:18.733
I don't exactly know where I should start.

209
00:15:23.743 --> 00:15:25.172
Since when...

210
00:15:26.212 --> 00:15:27.442
did Aji 3...

211
00:15:29.342 --> 00:15:31.312
start feeling special to you?

212
00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.023
I can answer that precisely.

213
00:15:34.722 --> 00:15:38.253
I felt that way starting from the first day she came to my house.

214
00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:43.023
You'll be laughing all night if you listen to my story.

215
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:47.062
Listen. I felt dumbfounded because of her starting from the first day.

216
00:15:47.163 --> 00:15:49.533
The first thing she said to me as soon as she saw me was...

217
00:15:49.863 --> 00:15:51.503
"My goodness!" That came from a robot.

218
00:15:51.503 --> 00:15:53.432
So I asked Doctor Hong about it,

219
00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:55.342
and he said it was because she was put on Friend Mode.

220
00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:57.312
So I told him that I got it.

221
00:15:57.312 --> 00:15:58.773
Then I prepared a question.

222
00:15:58.773 --> 00:16:01.243
I put an egg inside a box.

223
00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:03.883
She was supposed to open the lock by answering the question.

224
00:16:03.883 --> 00:16:06.113
But she suddenly hit the box with her fist,

225
00:16:06.113 --> 00:16:07.722
and the box broke.

226
00:16:07.952 --> 00:16:10.452
I was so surprised at how strong the robot was.

227
00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:12.722
Anyway, she managed to take the egg out.

228
00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:13.763
Oh, there's one more.

229
00:16:14.592 --> 00:16:18.393
I slipped on soap while I was holding a bottle of perfume.

230
00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:21.263
But she chose to save the bottle instead of...

231
00:16:21.832 --> 00:16:26.503
What do you think would've happened if she had told him the truth?

232
00:16:27.773 --> 00:16:33.072
My gosh, I already told you numerous times.

233
00:16:33.072 --> 00:16:34.842
If she told him the truth,

234
00:16:34.842 --> 00:16:38.113
Min Kyu could've died.

235
00:16:38.353 --> 00:16:40.883
There's a possibility that he might not have died.

236
00:16:40.883 --> 00:16:42.422
We can't calculate...

237
00:16:43.552 --> 00:16:45.922
that possibility.

238
00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.163
I understand.

239
00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:51.592
Only the heart could be able to figure that out, not the mind.

240
00:16:52.592 --> 00:16:53.692
It's all about trust.

241
00:16:53.692 --> 00:16:57.472
You're completely right. It's all in the heart.

242
00:16:57.472 --> 00:16:58.832
I'm saying you didn't trust that...

243
00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:04.113
he would believe you even if you told him the truth.

244
00:17:05.373 --> 00:17:08.413
You thought Min Kyu's love for Ji A...

245
00:17:09.482 --> 00:17:13.313
and the Santa Maria Research Team...

246
00:17:14.522 --> 00:17:17.593
wasn't enough for him to trust...

247
00:17:17.593 --> 00:17:19.553
your confession.

248
00:17:22.863 --> 00:17:23.962
But...

249
00:17:26.863 --> 00:17:29.962
how are you going to prove that your judgment was right?

250
00:17:31.732 --> 00:17:34.903
Doctors even perform surgeries on patients...

251
00:17:35.343 --> 00:17:36.543
who only have...

252
00:17:36.873 --> 00:17:40.012
a 99 percent possibility of survival.

253
00:17:41.782 --> 00:17:45.252
And that remaining one percent sometimes makes miracles happen.

254
00:17:45.252 --> 00:17:47.323
That one percent...

255
00:17:47.982 --> 00:17:51.692
You do have a point, Sun Hye.

256
00:17:51.692 --> 00:17:54.962
- But... - You're right. Doctors can do that.

257
00:17:54.962 --> 00:17:57.293
They can risk everything on that one percent.

258
00:17:57.293 --> 00:17:58.932
But the patient's family...

259
00:18:00.803 --> 00:18:01.803
can't.

260
00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:05.633
Can you send your parents into the OR if they only have...

261
00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:09.573
a one percent chance of survival?

262
00:18:12.373 --> 00:18:14.113
We think of Min Kyu...

263
00:18:15.982 --> 00:18:17.452
as our family now.

264
00:18:18.252 --> 00:18:21.323
This guy is becoming more and more attractive.

265
00:18:22.452 --> 00:18:23.452
Who?

266
00:18:26.093 --> 00:18:27.123
Me?

267
00:18:36.163 --> 00:18:37.202
Yes, Doctor Oh.

268
00:18:37.573 --> 00:18:38.702
Are you there yet?

269
00:18:39.502 --> 00:18:41.603
No, not yet. Our van broke down.

270
00:18:42.103 --> 00:18:43.103
Oh, dear.

271
00:18:43.702 --> 00:18:46.343
Give me an update on them as soon as you get there.

272
00:18:46.343 --> 00:18:49.482
And if, by any chance, Min Kyu gets rashes, you should open his bag.

273
00:18:49.643 --> 00:18:52.153
There will be an injection that he carries around for emergency.

274
00:18:52.883 --> 00:18:54.522
That won't ever happen.

275
00:18:55.053 --> 00:18:56.123
I hope so.

276
00:18:56.782 --> 00:18:57.952
If he gets as shocked as Johnny did,

277
00:18:57.952 --> 00:19:00.722
that injection might not be enough to get rid of his allergy symptoms.

278
00:19:01.293 --> 00:19:02.293
Please stay alert.

279
00:19:02.522 --> 00:19:03.522
Okay.

280
00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:08.833
Where did she go?

281
00:19:15.043 --> 00:19:16.043
Why didn't you wake me up?

282
00:19:16.272 --> 00:19:17.772
You were sound asleep.

283
00:19:18.873 --> 00:19:20.272
You still should've woken me up.

284
00:19:25.282 --> 00:19:27.182
- Let's go. - Wait.

285
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.762
It's okay. Let's go.

286
00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.702
It's okay. We can go after I wipe your hand.

287
00:19:44.373 --> 00:19:45.732
I'm sorry for not listening to you back then.

288
00:19:46.202 --> 00:19:47.242
But...

289
00:19:47.803 --> 00:19:49.043
I don't regret...

290
00:19:49.803 --> 00:19:50.813
having stayed with Min Kyu.

291
00:19:51.813 --> 00:19:53.043
You also did...

292
00:19:53.742 --> 00:19:55.343
your best.

293
00:19:56.482 --> 00:19:58.083
And that's also...

294
00:19:59.383 --> 00:20:01.853
something you can't undo.

295
00:20:14.462 --> 00:20:15.462
I...

296
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.403
ended everything...

297
00:20:20.272 --> 00:20:21.303
by resetting Aji 3.

298
00:20:23.702 --> 00:20:24.742
I was a fool.

299
00:20:27.883 --> 00:20:29.413
This is the end of my story.

300
00:20:31.383 --> 00:20:35.682
I don't think it's exactly the end.

301
00:20:36.182 --> 00:20:38.553
It is the end.

302
00:20:38.893 --> 00:20:40.762
No, what I mean is...

303
00:20:41.123 --> 00:20:43.363
You need to tell me how you've been doing...

304
00:20:43.363 --> 00:20:45.333
after you reset her until now...

305
00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.232
for your story to fully end.

306
00:20:47.232 --> 00:20:49.432
You can't just stop in the middle.

307
00:20:49.663 --> 00:20:51.532
That story won't be any fun.

308
00:20:51.873 --> 00:20:54.543
I'll decide myself if it's fun or not.

309
00:20:54.843 --> 00:20:56.803
Do you really want to know?

310
00:21:06.982 --> 00:21:07.982
At first,

311
00:21:09.922 --> 00:21:11.293
it really hurt.

312
00:21:13.823 --> 00:21:14.962
And it was hard to get by.

313
00:21:17.863 --> 00:21:19.793
But after some time,

314
00:21:20.432 --> 00:21:21.903
I became a little better.

315
00:21:27.543 --> 00:21:31.442
And I started working at my company like a normal person.

316
00:21:32.712 --> 00:21:34.913
And I eat like everyone else at the cafeteria.

317
00:21:35.212 --> 00:21:36.843
And I go home like everyone else as well.

318
00:21:39.182 --> 00:21:40.853
I also go to the movies...

319
00:21:42.353 --> 00:21:44.093
and the bookstore by myself.

320
00:21:56.303 --> 00:21:57.333
If...

321
00:21:59.202 --> 00:22:02.472
Aji 3 saw how you're doing right now,

322
00:22:06.043 --> 00:22:07.813
she'll compliment you...

323
00:22:10.043 --> 00:22:11.913
by saying "Good job."

324
00:22:13.883 --> 00:22:14.952
No.

325
00:22:17.722 --> 00:22:18.992
This is...

326
00:22:20.393 --> 00:22:21.863
what she would've said.

327
00:22:33.303 --> 00:22:34.543
You did well.

328
00:22:39.613 --> 00:22:40.613
"You did well."

329
00:22:54.323 --> 00:22:56.692
See? I told you it'll be boring.

330
00:22:57.732 --> 00:22:59.032
No, that's not it.

331
00:23:02.732 --> 00:23:03.772
But...

332
00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:07.702
why did you say...

333
00:23:09.403 --> 00:23:11.272
you were a fool for having reset her?

334
00:23:13.043 --> 00:23:14.043
That's a secret.

335
00:23:16.242 --> 00:23:17.813
Can you please tell me?

336
00:23:18.083 --> 00:23:19.752
I'll tell you if you agree to be my friend.

337
00:23:20.053 --> 00:23:21.922
Because friends shouldn't keep secrets.

338
00:23:24.022 --> 00:23:26.053
Do you want to be my friend?

339
00:23:35.532 --> 00:23:37.873
By the way, you're really cute.

340
00:23:45.073 --> 00:23:46.073
Sorry.

341
00:23:46.643 --> 00:23:48.883
Tell me if you're sorry.

342
00:23:59.722 --> 00:24:00.992
I tried inputting...

343
00:24:01.863 --> 00:24:03.323
my information on Aji 3 again.

344
00:24:05.432 --> 00:24:07.232
I wanted her...

345
00:24:09.903 --> 00:24:11.232
to come back.

346
00:24:13.732 --> 00:24:16.202
I said everything I said to her when we first met.

347
00:24:16.202 --> 00:24:17.672
I also behaved exactly the same.

348
00:24:19.512 --> 00:24:22.383
I stayed up all night inputting the same information I had input before.

349
00:24:25.712 --> 00:24:26.913
She...

350
00:24:29.282 --> 00:24:30.922
never came back.

351
00:24:35.762 --> 00:24:36.893
Thinking back,

352
00:24:38.633 --> 00:24:41.863
this is what my heart kept telling me.

353
00:24:43.663 --> 00:24:47.202
Everything that I feel is real.

354
00:24:51.643 --> 00:24:53.043
As I was scared,

355
00:24:55.383 --> 00:24:58.383
I ignored that thought.

356
00:24:58.952 --> 00:25:00.012
In the end,

357
00:25:02.682 --> 00:25:04.123
as a consequence,

358
00:25:05.623 --> 00:25:07.123
I was punished.

359
00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:14.702
That's why.

360
00:25:15.363 --> 00:25:16.903
It's the reason why...

361
00:25:19.103 --> 00:25:21.242
I'm rambling in front of you.

362
00:25:32.613 --> 00:25:34.182
When time passes,

363
00:25:34.653 --> 00:25:37.293
will things go back to the way they were?

364
00:25:38.593 --> 00:25:40.992
If it isn't possible now,

365
00:25:41.293 --> 00:25:43.323
passing of time won't matter.

366
00:25:44.032 --> 00:25:46.333
Min Kyu must completely believe Ji A...

367
00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:49.133
and what we tell him.

368
00:25:49.903 --> 00:25:52.202
Everything depends on that,

369
00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:56.442
but how can we explain such a complicated situation?

370
00:25:56.843 --> 00:26:00.043
Even if we explain, who would believe it?

371
00:26:00.272 --> 00:26:02.083
Even I can't.

372
00:26:07.123 --> 00:26:09.482
You got an offer to be a professor.

373
00:26:10.893 --> 00:26:13.692
Sorry, I didn't mean to see the message.

374
00:26:15.593 --> 00:26:16.762
I'm not interested.

375
00:26:16.762 --> 00:26:19.232
Why not? Such opportunity doesn't come often.

376
00:26:19.762 --> 00:26:21.333
I'm happy where I'm now.

377
00:26:21.732 --> 00:26:25.172
I hope that you'll take the offer.

378
00:26:25.702 --> 00:26:28.303
- It'll be good for your future... - Once it's time to leave,

379
00:26:28.303 --> 00:26:30.643
I'll leave quietly so that you won't notice.

380
00:26:31.972 --> 00:26:35.212
Please concentrate on driving for now.

381
00:26:35.913 --> 00:26:37.813
You're so stubborn.

382
00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:44.922
It's dawn.

383
00:26:49.293 --> 00:26:50.962
Time flies.

384
00:26:55.432 --> 00:26:57.303
I talked too much about me.

385
00:26:57.972 --> 00:26:59.403
Tell me about yourself.

386
00:27:04.073 --> 00:27:06.143
May I ask you a question?

387
00:27:07.482 --> 00:27:08.782
Tell me about your family.

388
00:27:08.982 --> 00:27:11.583
I have a brother, a sister-in-law,

389
00:27:11.583 --> 00:27:15.123
a niece and me.

390
00:27:16.053 --> 00:27:18.222
They'll have another child soon.

391
00:27:18.952 --> 00:27:21.063
Do you live off of your brother?

392
00:27:23.293 --> 00:27:24.393
Sorry.

393
00:27:26.293 --> 00:27:29.732
I'm not careful with my words sometimes.

394
00:27:30.032 --> 00:27:33.633
Right, it's not an easy habit to get rid of.

395
00:27:34.543 --> 00:27:35.543
Pardon me?

396
00:27:36.643 --> 00:27:38.772
What's your next question?

397
00:27:41.742 --> 00:27:44.512
Who do you miss the most right now?

398
00:27:47.752 --> 00:27:51.293
My ideal type and a mentor for life.

399
00:27:51.293 --> 00:27:52.492
Who is it?

400
00:27:53.863 --> 00:27:55.762
It's my late father.

401
00:27:57.732 --> 00:28:01.432
When I was young, my dad ran a garage.

402
00:28:02.303 --> 00:28:05.873
I played at the garage after school.

403
00:28:07.032 --> 00:28:09.942
When broken and damaged cars came in,

404
00:28:09.942 --> 00:28:13.073
he fixed them and made them shiny.

405
00:28:13.073 --> 00:28:14.782
He made them able to run again.

406
00:28:15.782 --> 00:28:17.813
Dad could fix...

407
00:28:17.813 --> 00:28:20.982
any damage on the car.

408
00:28:21.383 --> 00:28:22.782
It was like magic.

409
00:28:25.623 --> 00:28:27.053
I wanted to be...

410
00:28:27.593 --> 00:28:30.262
like my dad.

411
00:28:31.593 --> 00:28:33.262
I wanted to be good at something.

412
00:28:37.103 --> 00:28:38.103
I see.

413
00:28:39.202 --> 00:28:40.772
I can imagine it clearly.

414
00:28:41.672 --> 00:28:45.143
What you hope for and your talents can't be the same.

415
00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:48.913
It feels like everyone else is lucky but you.

416
00:28:50.343 --> 00:28:52.182
At some point,

417
00:28:52.553 --> 00:28:57.752
I wondered if I was a useless person in the world.

418
00:29:05.593 --> 00:29:07.532
How did anyone come up with this idea?

419
00:29:07.903 --> 00:29:09.133
Was it a genius?

420
00:29:09.462 --> 00:29:11.932
Or a master?

421
00:29:16.202 --> 00:29:17.573
I want to meet...

422
00:29:18.813 --> 00:29:21.282
the person who made this umbrella.

423
00:29:24.252 --> 00:29:25.712
One person...

424
00:29:27.012 --> 00:29:29.252
reassured me that I'm useful.

425
00:29:30.422 --> 00:29:33.123
He made me feel that I shouldn't give up.

426
00:29:37.093 --> 00:29:38.992
I don't know who it was,

427
00:29:39.432 --> 00:29:42.803
but if he heard what you said, he'd feel proud.

428
00:29:44.732 --> 00:29:45.932
Do you think so?

429
00:29:46.732 --> 00:29:49.343
The fact that you were...

430
00:29:49.343 --> 00:29:51.772
important to someone...

431
00:29:51.772 --> 00:29:53.272
is encouraging.

432
00:29:55.583 --> 00:29:57.153
I see.

433
00:29:59.553 --> 00:30:01.282
When you see him next time,

434
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:04.252
you should tell him that.

435
00:30:07.422 --> 00:30:08.563
I will.

436
00:30:18.803 --> 00:30:19.932
Min Kyu.

437
00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:24.242
Now...

438
00:30:24.643 --> 00:30:27.383
you told me enough about you.

439
00:30:28.942 --> 00:30:31.512
I listened to you enough.

440
00:30:33.353 --> 00:30:34.722
As you promised,

441
00:30:36.383 --> 00:30:39.192
go back to Seoul...

442
00:30:39.192 --> 00:30:40.762
without regrets.

443
00:30:45.762 --> 00:30:47.462
When time passes,

444
00:30:49.833 --> 00:30:51.573
everything...

445
00:30:53.472 --> 00:30:56.873
Gosh, I remember how it was back then.

446
00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:01.583
Everything will remain as memories.

447
00:31:04.452 --> 00:31:07.883
I hope you'll be happy, Min Kyu.

448
00:31:11.022 --> 00:31:12.222
With all my heart.

449
00:31:42.952 --> 00:31:44.653
Gosh, you startled me.

450
00:31:55.477 --> 00:31:58.677
(Episode 24 will air shortly.)
