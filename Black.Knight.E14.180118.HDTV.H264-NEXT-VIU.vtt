(Episode 14)

2
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.060
Hae Ra, are you home?

3
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.261
Hae Ra.

Your call cannot be connected.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430
Please leave your message after the tone.

6
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.201
She won't pick up?

7
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.031
Yes, she's not picking up.

8
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.771
She did say that we should start...

9
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:02.841
looking for a place to move out.

10
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.211
Any reasons?

11
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.811
I'm not sure.

12
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.880
Maybe it's because she likes you,

13
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.651
but feels sorry for you at the same time.

14
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.750
I'm not so sure either.

15
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:16.921
I'm going over to her office.

16
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.921
Okay.

17
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.990
(General Business Department, Jung Hae Ra)

Your call cannot be connected.

19
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:15.150
Please leave your message after the tone.

20
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:19.381
Excuse me.

21
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:21.391
How much is it for a bag of roasted chestnuts?

22
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.620
Five dollars for a bag.

23
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.620
Then I'll take a bag.

24
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:26.191
Okay, one second.

25
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.351
When did she leave?

26
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.080
I didn't see her...

27
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.680
because she went to work early today.

28
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.981
I think she took her stuff at that time.

29
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.560
I got that ring that she was so angry over.

30
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.090
Did she leave because...

31
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.761
she got upset over that ring?

32
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.030
I doubt that.

33
00:03:05.701 --> 00:03:07.131
I'm sure there is another reason.

34
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.120
Did you make perfume without telling me?

35
00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:30.860
This oil is the secret to my youthful skin.

36
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.990
It's a little too early,

37
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.590
but let's grab some champagne.

38
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.530
What's the occasion this late at night?

39
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.161
She left Soo Ho.

40
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.430
What?

41
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.971
She packed up and left.

42
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.101
Why?

43
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:49.740
She probably figured he wasn't hers.

44
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.710
Nonsense.

45
00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.411
My 200-year-old frustration is...

46
00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:56.780
finally starting to get relieved.

47
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.481
I guess everything is returning to its place.

(To Jung Hae Ra, General Business)

49
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.891
(From Park)

50
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.960
(Dear Ms. Lee Mi Soon)

51
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.030
It's a letter your dad wrote...

52
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.571
to the social worker.

53
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.540
I sent one to Soo Ho as well.

54
00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:00.611
(Dear Ms. Lee Mi Soon)

55
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.350
This was a very difficult decision.

56
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:05.451
It was very painful...

57
00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:07.321
to give up my friend's son...

58
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:08.691
after deciding to adopt him,

59
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:10.251
but I cannot help this.

60
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.960
He went into my daughter's room...

61
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.090
and frightened her by turning off the lights,

62
00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:17.801
and he said many things to delude her as well.

63
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:21.301
He always has a knife in his drawer.

64
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:25.371
He also has much knowledge about dangerous chemicals.

65
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:33.611
Remember that there is a social worker...

66
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.951
who remembers you almost like a delinquent, Soo Ho.

67
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.641
It was the desperate heart of the two...

68
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.241
that brought luck to Soo Ho.

69
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.381
If even one decides to close her heart,

70
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.881
everything will be over.

71
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.121
That will not happen.

72
00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:33.340
Miss!

73
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.410
Miss, let's grab a drink. Open the door.

74
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.040
I saw you walking into this room.

75
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.011
Open the door!

76
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:45.780
Why did a woman like you come here alone?

77
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.350
Come on. Open the door.

78
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.891
I'm worried about you, that's all.

79
00:06:52.861 --> 00:06:55.691
Come on, open the door.

80
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.301
Hey, Gon.

81
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:01.270
I just saw your missed call.

82
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.400
Miss, come on, let's grab a drink.

83
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.571
Where are you?

84
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:08.071
- Well... - It's on me!

85
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.051
(Motel Tree)

86
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:19.621
I'm fine.

87
00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:21.920
I'm not scared of men like that.

88
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.191
Did you move out of his house?

89
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.290
It's none of your business.

90
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.631
Why did you call me then?

91
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.571
Because I couldn't get a hold of your dad.

92
00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:39.871
Why is your dad so nasty?

93
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.611
Never mind him. Just ignore him.

94
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:45.340
You know what he's like.

95
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:47.210
Hey, give me my suitcase.

96
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.410
Just get in.

97
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:51.080
I'll take you to another place to stay.

98
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.761
It's my close friend's place.

99
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.501
Make yourself at home.

100
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:11.501
(Missed calls)

101
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.181
(Black Knight)

102
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.631
I made you coffee.

103
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.200
Thank you.

104
00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:51.341
I got the ring.

105
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:54.981
That precious silver ring.

106
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.950
Tell Hae Ra to come home.

107
00:08:58.751 --> 00:09:00.450
I'm the one being kicked out.

108
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.190
Why did she leave?

109
00:09:04.091 --> 00:09:06.190
Mr. Moon.

110
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.591
Mr. Moon. Did you leave for work already?

111
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:08.961
No, I'm here.

112
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.231
Hae Ra texted me late last night.

113
00:09:12.231 --> 00:09:15.231
She's staying at her colleague's place.

114
00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:16.731
She said not to worry.

115
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.940
Why did she leave the house?

116
00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:24.410
She didn't say.

117
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.410
If she doesn't answer your calls,

118
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.881
try texting her.

119
00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:31.820
She'll call me when she's ready.

120
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:34.150
Sometimes you want to be left alone.

121
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.160
I'll get to work now.

122
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.190
All right.

123
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.040
Hae Ra, you're here early.

124
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.310
Good morning.

125
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.081
Ma'am, would you like some coffee?

126
00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:06.221
There you go.

127
00:10:06.221 --> 00:10:07.650
Thank you.

128
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.560
Why don't you go to Mr. Moon's office today?

129
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.891
I have to go to the gallery...

130
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:15.761
to meet with the exhibition curator.

131
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.631
That's right. I forgot.

132
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:19.030
I'll send Ju Hee then.

133
00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:20.361
Okay.

134
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:23.270
It's obvious.

135
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.670
What is?

136
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.270
That Mr. Moon likes you.

137
00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:32.180
He tries not to show it, but I can tell.

138
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.751
I think that's cute.

139
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.391
I gave the name tag to the police,

140
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.721
but that's not enough to provide a lead.

141
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.391
I believe it's a name tag from my uniform.

142
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.400
It's the same color as my old school's name tag.

143
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.831
Why was it there?

144
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.471
I don't know.

145
00:10:57.101 --> 00:10:58.670
Do you have any idea?

146
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.570
Wait a minute.

147
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.950
This was taken less than a year after I left.

148
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.680
Name tags were sewn on.

149
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.320
Maybe it was someone else's...

150
00:11:17.621 --> 00:11:19.560
or someone tore it off and put it there.

151
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.391
Why?

152
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.300
It's nothing. I went too far.

153
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.570
They cremated him and...

154
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.200
scattered the ashes at a grave site.

155
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.231
Who did?

156
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.871
Gon's dad and people from the company.

157
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.881
Aunt Sook Hee, it's me.

158
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.391
Hello.

159
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:52.761
I'm here to see Mr. Moon.

160
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.560
He's in his office.

161
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:03.231
Why did you ask me to bring this?

162
00:12:03.231 --> 00:12:04.741
You're making me nervous.

163
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.440
I have to look into something.

164
00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:10.841
Sure. I trust you.

165
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.211
Let me know if Hae Ra calls.

166
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:14.680
Of course.

167
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.751
I'll get going now.

168
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:17.820
Okay.

169
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.751
- Take care. - Bye.

170
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:21.891
- Goodbye. - Bye.

171
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.160
Give this to the police.

172
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.101
Okay. We'll have the result right away.

173
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.001
(Archaeology Art History Exhibition)

174
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.361
Hey!

175
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:11.670
I'm sorry. I thought you were my friend.

176
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:13.871
She has a bob haircut too.

177
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:19.141
- Are you the curator? - Yes.

178
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:20.810
I'm from the travel agency.

179
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.450
I'm Jung Hae Ra.

180
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:27.221
I was waiting for you.

181
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.721
I'm Koo Jang Bin.

182
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.221
- Nice to meet you. - You too.

183
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.131
It's a great exhibition.

184
00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:36.391
Thanks. I had a lot of help.

185
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.261
The exhibition we'll hold at a barber shop...

186
00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:41.530
"100-year History of Neighbors".

187
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.530
What do you think?

188
00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:45.400
We'll use pictures of current residents...

189
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.070
and use some from here too.

190
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.711
That sounds great.

191
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:50.711
I especially...

192
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.251
like this picture.

193
00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:57.650
This belongs to my grandpa.

194
00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:02.550
It looks really old.

195
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.861
My grandfather's grandfather's father...

196
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.891
painted it.

197
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:12.231
My family kept it at home like a treasure.

198
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.530
Who did he paint?

199
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.070
Your grandparents?

200
00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:26.540
I don't think there was anyone...

201
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.611
that handsome in my family.

202
00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:30.721
He probably painted him much more handsome.

203
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.251
Much more handsome?

204
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.650
That much?

205
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.001
I'm glad you're here.

206
00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:54.211
Tell your dad it was very touching.

207
00:15:02.111 --> 00:15:03.111
(It's a letter your dad wrote...)

208
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.121
(to the social worker.)

209
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.621
Just ignore it.

210
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.290
Getting upset over this will make you an amateur.

211
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.261
I'm here because I thought you might be worried.

212
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.501
Hae Ra is fine.

213
00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:23.700
I got her a studio apartment...

214
00:15:24.641 --> 00:15:25.900
near her work.

215
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.670
She contacted you?

216
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.081
Yes, last night.

217
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.981
I guess she moved out of your house.

218
00:15:34.981 --> 00:15:36.381
You don't need to worry about her.

219
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.101
Hae Ra. Let's bring some coffee.

220
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:00.540
Did you hear the announcement?

221
00:16:01.141 --> 00:16:02.270
What announcement?

222
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.540
Geumseong-dong?

223
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.111
It was selected for the revival project.

224
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.950
That's great news.

225
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.251
That's why we're having a meeting now.

226
00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:13.050
Coffee. We need coffee.

227
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:20.290
The laundromat and supermarket...

228
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.891
must not disappear.

229
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:24.001
If the neighborhood fails to be a living space,

230
00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:25.200
then it'll feel desolate.

231
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:37.611
The residents of the mural village's...

232
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:39.440
privacy is being invaded...

233
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.310
because of tourists taking pictures.

234
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.800
Mr. Moon.

235
00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:05.900
So what's your conclusion?

236
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:07.271
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:09.910
A neighborhood that exists solely as...

238
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.740
a tourist town has no vitality.

239
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.781
The residents have to come first.

240
00:17:14.111 --> 00:17:15.980
We need to make sure...

241
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.321
it doesn't become a speculation-ridden area.

242
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.091
It's too broad...

243
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:28.230
if you say a trip to the US in March.

244
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.561
Please tell me a specific city like New York...

245
00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:31.160
or San Francisco for example,

246
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.601
so that I can search available tickets for you.

247
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.740
I should've bought some land on that area too.

248
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.000
Goodness, Chief Director Lee.

249
00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:42.371
- I was joking. - I'll go then.

250
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:44.940
- Thank you for today. - Thank you.

251
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.940
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

252
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.990
I'll search for available tickets to Chicago then.

253
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.900
You've gone through so much until now.

254
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.430
I'm glad your hard work paid off.

255
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.801
It's all thanks to you.

256
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:12.170
Well begun is half done.

257
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.210
We're halfway through.

258
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.331
Are you here to see me?

259
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.771
Say if you have something to say.

260
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:51.141
Congratulations.

261
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.710
I heard you're staying at a studio near the office.

262
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.480
Did Gon tell you that?

263
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.851
You moved out because you became concerned...

264
00:18:57.851 --> 00:18:59.250
after receiving Chairman Park's letter.

265
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.420
And...

266
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:02.621
you called his son?

267
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.391
That's not it.

268
00:19:08.631 --> 00:19:10.760
Never mind. Think as you please.

269
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.101
You disappeared without saying anything.

270
00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:20.871
And I don't like that.

271
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.940
Right.

272
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:28.551
Your father was cruel to me.

273
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.851
It's true that I suffered for a while...

274
00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:35.190
because I was reminded of how he hurt me.

275
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.720
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:41.891 --> 00:19:43.791
But I still love you.

277
00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:49.101
Who told me not to break up?

278
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.531
You did.

279
00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:56.141
I had no idea...

280
00:19:56.141 --> 00:19:58.980
that Gon's father had the letter.

281
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:01.081
Whether he had the letter or not,

282
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:02.351
it was up to him.

283
00:20:02.351 --> 00:20:03.581
Why did you get swayed?

284
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:07.021
I feel too sorry to see you.

285
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:08.720
Then love me more.

286
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:13.920
I understand that you want to be alone.

287
00:20:14.331 --> 00:20:15.561
I won't take you with me.

288
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:19.531
But come back home within a week.

289
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.771
You can't stay outside longer than that.

290
00:20:20.771 --> 00:20:21.801
I'll miss you too much.

291
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.841
Answer me or I'll do the cream bread here.

292
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:33.341
I'm going to work then.

293
00:21:31.641 --> 00:21:32.700
Honey.

294
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.010
I'm in this room.

295
00:21:38.541 --> 00:21:40.010
I'm home.

296
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.510
You're home.

297
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.771
I'm happy now.

298
00:22:05.841 --> 00:22:08.210
You were my husband from the start.

299
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.071
I'm sorry if I startled you.

300
00:22:35.601 --> 00:22:36.970
It's my work habit.

301
00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:39.470
I wanted to organize your clothes.

302
00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:41.771
You don't need to do such a thing.

303
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.910
Why are you home at this hour?

304
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:46.740
I have a funeral to attend to at night.

305
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.980
I'm picking up my suit.

306
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.851
Shouldn't you iron your suit?

307
00:22:55.351 --> 00:22:56.450
It's okay.

308
00:23:00.321 --> 00:23:01.861
Do you want to have some tea with me?

309
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.000
Sure.

310
00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.371
Aunt Sook Hee went to exercise...

311
00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:14.611
at a culture center.

312
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:16.940
She takes swimming and singing lessons.

313
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:20.541
Will you come home late after the funeral?

314
00:23:20.881 --> 00:23:22.581
I've already prepared for tonight's dinner.

315
00:23:24.081 --> 00:23:27.180
I want you to move out today.

316
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.760
I'll tell my workers to deliver your stuff.

317
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.831
I thought I was moving out next week.

318
00:23:37.131 --> 00:23:38.500
Hae Ra isn't home.

319
00:23:39.061 --> 00:23:40.460
I think it'd be uncomfortable for you.

320
00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:42.871
- It's not. - I'm sorry.

321
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.500
It's uncomfortable for me.

322
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.081
Don't you think you're too harsh on me?

323
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:56.811
Your tailor shop isn't cold at all.

324
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:58.351
It doesn't need any construction work either.

325
00:24:14.801 --> 00:24:16.771
Don't go. I have something to say.

326
00:24:19.141 --> 00:24:21.041
I'll hear it another time.

327
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.710
You...

328
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.920
were my husband in your previous life.

329
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:41.291
You were my husband,

330
00:24:42.061 --> 00:24:44.930
but you fell in love with my slave and dumped me.

331
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.500
I killed you two out of sorrow.

332
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:53.101
I'm living until now as a punishment.

333
00:24:54.541 --> 00:24:55.641
Right.

334
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.381
I killed you two,

335
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.010
but I was abandoned first.

336
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.381
You made me sin.

337
00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:06.250
Are you going to do the same this time again?

338
00:25:24.641 --> 00:25:25.871
You want to hug me?

339
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.710
Don't scheme a thing...

340
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.081
to me and Hae Ra.

341
00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:34.281
Do you think I'm lying?

342
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:36.210
I'm not interested in you.

343
00:25:38.521 --> 00:25:40.720
It's just like in the past.

344
00:25:42.091 --> 00:25:43.650
You're stabbing a dagger in my heart.

345
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.821
That's enough.

346
00:25:45.061 --> 00:25:46.361
I don't want to hear anymore.

347
00:25:46.361 --> 00:25:49.260
You'll be reminded of my story at one moment.

348
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.061
You'll feel so sorry to me then.

349
00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:55.301
The way I see it,

350
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.470
you need a mental treatment.

351
00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.271
You can treat me.

352
00:26:00.301 --> 00:26:02.041
I love Hae Ra.

353
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:04.510
I'm going to propose to her soon.

354
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:12.281
Do you not need my land?

355
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.720
No.

356
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.791
I can't work with someone...

357
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:16.950
who mixes public and private matters.

358
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:27.061
You'll remember me.

359
00:26:28.571 --> 00:26:30.271
You were my husband,

360
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.970
and you have to give me your love...

361
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.271
that you failed to give.

362
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.121
Hello.

363
00:26:53.121 --> 00:26:54.891
- Happy New Year. - Hello.

364
00:26:54.891 --> 00:26:56.690
Happy New Year.

365
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.700
Come, come.

366
00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.831
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

367
00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:01.371
Have you been well?

368
00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:03.400
We've got limited-edition shirts from Milano.

369
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.200
- Come pay a visit. - I will.

370
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:08.510
The madam of Sinjin Group is holding this event.

371
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.871
Maybe that's why the guests are all so fancy.

372
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:12.111
Thank goodness we didn't miss this.

373
00:27:12.141 --> 00:27:13.940
The CEO of Bukchon Construction is here too.

374
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.980
Did you say hello to him?

375
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.250
I did a while ago.

376
00:27:22.791 --> 00:27:23.891
Hey, Hae Ra.

377
00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:24.891
Hey.

378
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:27.220
I'll be away for a few days.

379
00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.660
Then how much do I pay for this place?

380
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.930
Why? Where are you going?

381
00:27:31.301 --> 00:27:33.301
Oh, I have to give someone a hand.

382
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.631
I'm not going to stay at a motel, so don't worry.

383
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.811
I'm at Gwanghwamun right now.

384
00:27:41.341 --> 00:27:42.670
I'll be right there. Wait for me.

385
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:45.510
What? Where are you going?

386
00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:49.250
Oh, I have to go see Hae Ra for a second.

387
00:27:49.581 --> 00:27:51.450
She's at Geon Wu's studio...

388
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.750
Are you insane?

389
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.450
The concert is about to begin.

390
00:27:55.121 --> 00:27:57.521
I already greeted everyone that I should. It's okay.

391
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.121
- Let's go. - I'm not leaving.

392
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.430
If you want to go, you're on your own.

393
00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:11.771
I'll call you.

394
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.141
The concert will begin shortly.

395
00:28:15.141 --> 00:28:18.781
Please enter the hall and be seated.

396
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:23.680
You'll get yourself into a big trouble.

397
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:33.561
Hae Ra.

398
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:35.561
Hae...

399
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:48.371
Hae Ra moved out of this studio.

400
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:50.841
It looks like you should look for her.

401
00:28:50.841 --> 00:28:52.510
I let her move to a safer place.

402
00:28:52.641 --> 00:28:53.841
Don't worry.

403
00:28:58.781 --> 00:29:00.180
(Park Gon)

404
00:29:04.391 --> 00:29:05.791
Please have a seat.

405
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:08.561
I'm sorry I asked you to do this so suddenly.

406
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.490
But I was in a hurry.

407
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.101
It's all right.

408
00:29:13.101 --> 00:29:15.930
Could you stay here for a few days...

409
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.301
and help me out?

410
00:29:17.771 --> 00:29:20.571
I don't know if I'll be of any help, but sure.

411
00:29:28.281 --> 00:29:30.381
Even if the City of Seoul bought out the building,

412
00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:33.021
it may not be possible to get pictures of...

413
00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:35.690
the insides if the family of the deceased say no.

414
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.121
So you'll have to discuss that...

415
00:29:37.121 --> 00:29:39.061
with the publisher before you proceed.

416
00:29:41.131 --> 00:29:44.000
Publishing a book is such a complicated process.

417
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.101
Right?

418
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.200
But your book sounds really interesting.

419
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.900
I hope it is.

420
00:29:51.571 --> 00:29:52.700
You must be tired.

421
00:29:53.301 --> 00:29:55.271
You should take a bath.

422
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:57.581
I prepared a soap that smells very good.

423
00:29:57.641 --> 00:29:58.811
Thank you.

424
00:30:04.021 --> 00:30:06.381
Thank you. I'm relieved now.

425
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.990
She's not sick, is she?

426
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.791
Of course not. She's very cheerful.

427
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.420
She had some midnight snack too.

428
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.760
I'm glad to hear that.

429
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.430
Please let her stay for a few days.

430
00:30:16.861 --> 00:30:18.200
Don't worry about it.

431
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:24.271
Yes, thank you.

432
00:30:24.871 --> 00:30:25.871
Bye.

You can keep that as a present.

I think I'll have a great dream.

444

Is the room warm enough?

445
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.061
Yes. Thank you.

446
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:21.561
Okay.

447
00:31:22.891 --> 00:31:24.700
Are you going to work?

Do you know this person?

456
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.670
I met him today.

457
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:04.771
Where?

458
00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:06.500
At Seochon Gallery.

459
00:32:14.881 --> 00:32:16.281
I found him.

460
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:23.720
Who's here at this hour?

461
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.871

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.131
was Hae Ra's dad.

How would I know?

470
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.230
I went there myself with a colleague to check,

471
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.700
then cremated his body as well.

472
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.000
The hospital. Call the hospital and ask.

473
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.301
It's been ages since the hospital closed down.

474
00:33:45.301 --> 00:33:46.940
There's no other way to check.

475
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.371
Then you can ask that guy, Moon Soo Ho.

476
00:33:54.551 --> 00:33:56.781
He's a kid who lived off of Mr. Jung.

477
00:33:57.551 --> 00:34:02.291
Mr. Jung really didn't like that kid.

478
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.130
I do not know why my name tag was found there.

479
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.530
I heard you fought with him too.

480
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.860
You're right.

481
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.831
Did you fight over Doctor Moon's research document?

482

Mr. Jung.

483
00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.720
Soo Ho.

484
00:34:37.621 --> 00:34:39.820
What are you doing?

485
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.260
Oh, I'm so sorry.

486
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.300
Can you let me borrow the research plan...

487
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.800
that has Doctor Moon's signature?

488
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.430
I believe you have it.

489
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.300
Are you going to...

490
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:54.070
use his research without consent again?

491
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.340
What do you mean?

492
00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.880
I know everything.

493
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:02.751
I know that's how you bought this huge house.

494
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:04.651
I am trying...

495
00:35:04.651 --> 00:35:07.521
to help him keep his honor.

496
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:11.191
I know you're lying.

497
00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:14.561
Look at how rude you are.

498
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.300
Take it.

499
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:29.110
There's nothing I can do with this now,

500
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.541
and if your business thrives,

501
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.811
it'll be good for Hae Ra too.

502
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.510
He just scolded me...

503
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.751
for my rebellious teenage attitude.

504
00:35:39.921 --> 00:35:42.990
He couldn't be that cold to his friend's son.

505
00:35:44.391 --> 00:35:46.191
He wrote this letter...

506
00:35:47.691 --> 00:35:49.331
to send you to an orphanage.

507
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.200
He was probably worried about his only daughter.

508
00:35:55.401 --> 00:35:57.601
Yes, I remember.

509
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.671
I clearly remember receiving that letter.

510
00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.311
I also remember the name, Moon Soo Ho.

511
00:36:04.311 --> 00:36:05.541
It was ages ago,

512
00:36:05.541 --> 00:36:07.910
and you probably get many of such letters.

513
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.610
How do you remember so well?

514
00:36:14.891 --> 00:36:16.121
(To Ms. Lee Mi Soon)

515
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.860
I remember it thanks to this letter.

516
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.360
(To Ms. Lee Mi Soon)

517
00:36:23.831 --> 00:36:26.101
Don't trust anything my dad said on the letter.

518
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.171
What I say is the truth.

519
00:36:28.271 --> 00:36:31.001
Soo Ho isn't someone that my dad describes.

520
00:36:32.171 --> 00:36:33.740
You have to trust me.

521
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.271
I knew at once...

522
00:36:36.641 --> 00:36:38.811
that what his daughter said is the truth.

523
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.851
She explained what her dad misunderstood...

524
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:43.211
very thoroughly...

525
00:36:43.211 --> 00:36:45.880
in a long 12-page letter.

526
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.351
I think my dad is saying...

527
00:37:54.521 --> 00:37:56.021
he's grateful...

528
00:37:56.391 --> 00:37:57.961
and sorry...

529
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.630
to you.

530
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:08.371
I'll find out why you had to lie there...

531
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.041
no matter what.

532
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:39.061
Goodness. Hae Ra.

533
00:38:39.061 --> 00:38:40.731
Welcome back.

534
00:38:43.831 --> 00:38:46.641
Your dad must've made Mr. Moon...

535
00:38:46.641 --> 00:38:49.671
to buy that land so he could find him.

536
00:38:50.811 --> 00:38:52.441
Go to your room...

537
00:38:52.441 --> 00:38:53.680
and take a rest.

538
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.860
You should lie down.

539
00:39:27.351 --> 00:39:29.380
You'll feel better after getting some sleep.

540
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.751
Soo Ho.

541
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.990
I'm sorry and thank you.

542
00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:45.360
Thank you so much.

543
00:39:58.711 --> 00:39:59.711
Sleep tight.

544
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.251
Please stay with me until I fall asleep.

545
00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:19.401
Really?

546
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.930
She moved in to that house?

547
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:22.930
Yes.

548
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.200
She did,

549
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.641
but she left a few days ago.

550
00:40:28.271 --> 00:40:31.410
Why aren't you making your move?

551
00:40:34.581 --> 00:40:36.180
I just got the chills.

552
00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.251
When she made Mr. Moon's shirt,

553
00:40:40.081 --> 00:40:42.990
she said she prayed to live with him.

554
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.291
I think Sharon is...

555
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:47.831
coveting someone else's man.

556
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:51.601
I know she's my boss,

557
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.061
but she's a meanie.

558
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.070
Who's someone else's man?

559
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.700
Goodness.

560
00:41:01.141 --> 00:41:02.470
I can't play with you.

561
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.470
Hey.

562
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.010
Did you stay at his house?

563
00:41:10.851 --> 00:41:13.081
Gosh, that's amazing.

564
00:41:13.521 --> 00:41:15.251
The shirt made your wish come true.

565
00:41:15.621 --> 00:41:17.251
It was useless.

566
00:41:18.461 --> 00:41:20.320
I lived with him,

567
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.030
but I wasn't happy.

568
00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:26.901
Is that what life is like?

569
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.530
You get your wish,

570
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.970
but after that is another matter.

571
00:41:35.671 --> 00:41:37.141
You told me.

572
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.081
Told you what?

573
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:41.680
You said I was attractive.

574
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.981
Of course you are.

575
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.751
That was a lie, wasn't it?

576
00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:51.891
No.

577
00:41:52.391 --> 00:41:53.660
You're really attractive.

578
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:59.061
My heart is racing right now.

579
00:42:03.671 --> 00:42:05.101
You're lying.

580
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.251
I'm not lying.

581
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.671
I didn't think you'd harm Hae Ra's dad.

582
00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.180
What are you saying?

583
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:48.251
I never harmed anyone.

584
00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:51.151
They're all my hometown friends.

585
00:42:51.521 --> 00:42:53.251
Don't think you're off the hook.

586
00:42:53.251 --> 00:42:54.751
It's not over yet.

587
00:42:55.921 --> 00:42:56.990
Soo Ho.

588
00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.961
I hear your competitors...

589
00:42:58.961 --> 00:43:01.291
and anyone who hurts you...

590
00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:03.490
either die or get hurt.

591
00:43:03.691 --> 00:43:05.700
Dal Hong's son is that case.

592
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:09.171
I guess you have a strange evil power.

593
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.970
That's why Hae Ra's dad died.

594
00:43:13.401 --> 00:43:15.441
You killed him.

595
00:43:19.081 --> 00:43:21.050
Then I guess you'll die soon too.

596
00:43:24.151 --> 00:43:26.450
I had been distressed because of that idea.

597
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.751
But after seeing you being so rich,

598
00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:30.791
and living so well, I realized that...

599
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.990
it was just a coincidence.

600
00:43:36.461 --> 00:43:37.961
Take Hae Ra...

601
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.561
and leave. Go far away.

602
00:43:41.401 --> 00:43:42.501
I will.

603
00:43:42.831 --> 00:43:44.601
After I take all your fortune,

604
00:43:45.401 --> 00:43:47.171
and make you pay for...

605
00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:49.771
killing Hae Ra's dad and my dad.

606
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.700
Hi.

607
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:18.371
Director Han Myung Soo. Nice to meet you.

608
00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:19.641
Nice to meet you.

609
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:21.470
I didn't know...

610
00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:25.180
Chan Ki was working with such a great boss.

611
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.481
Uncle Myung Soo, thank you.

612
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:29.410
Hey,

613
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.981
I should be the one saying that here.

614
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:35.751
I'd like to talk to him alone.

615
00:44:35.751 --> 00:44:37.360
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

616
00:44:40.191 --> 00:44:41.260
- Please sit down. - Okay.

617
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.130
Your nephew is very smart.

618
00:44:44.331 --> 00:44:45.831
He's equal to 100 employees.

619
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:49.831
I'm grateful that I'm offered...

620
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:51.541
an adviser position with great conditions...

621
00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:53.601
at a company my nephew works for.

622
00:44:54.441 --> 00:44:55.510
You shouldn't be...

623
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.240
a dishonorable uncle to your nephew.

624
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:01.610
You made many people cry...

625
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.780
when you worked at a construction company.

626
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.891
What do you mean?

627
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:09.921
Forced removal. Moving native residents.

628
00:45:10.121 --> 00:45:11.760
Of course, it wasn't your fault.

629
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.760
Huge capital.

630
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.090
Power in collusion with capital. Henchmen.

631
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.331
All three had to be in place.

632
00:45:17.561 --> 00:45:19.300
Look, Mr. Moon.

633
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.831
You'll be an adviser to my company.

634
00:45:22.371 --> 00:45:24.240
I will protect your honor.

635
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.871
You just need to remember one thing later.

636
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.410
What...

637
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:31.311
would that be?

638
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:36.481
When you were an executive at a construction company,

639
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.921
there was someone...

640
00:45:38.921 --> 00:45:41.220
who was paid to set the lab on fire.

641
00:45:41.891 --> 00:45:44.260
You just need to remember his name.

642
00:45:47.121 --> 00:45:49.760
It wasn't your fault. You're not responsible.

643
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.660
Of course I'll keep it a secret from Chang Ki.

644
00:46:02.641 --> 00:46:04.240
It was an expected outcome.

645
00:46:04.481 --> 00:46:05.740
Since it's in the center of Seoul,

646
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.680
it'll become a speculation-ridden area.

647
00:46:09.081 --> 00:46:10.280
If that happens...

648
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:13.251
Then things will go the way we want.

649
00:46:14.151 --> 00:46:16.191
The city revival project will be cancelled.

650
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:17.691
New buildings will be built.

651
00:46:18.461 --> 00:46:20.561
What will happen to Mr. Moon then?

652
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:24.731
An innocent businessman who chased after a dream.

653
00:46:25.101 --> 00:46:26.101
He'll be considered...

654
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:28.130
a minor businessman with no sense.

655
00:46:28.671 --> 00:46:30.501
It'll be hard for him to do business in Korea.

656
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:35.041
Mr. Moon will be sad.

657
00:46:37.811 --> 00:46:39.141
I want to console him...

658
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.251
when he's sad.

659
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:46.621
Making him sad...

660
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:48.791
should be done first.

661
00:46:50.151 --> 00:46:51.260
I guess so.

662
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.970
It's amazing how it looks so lifelike.

663
00:47:23.121 --> 00:47:24.191
Hello.

664
00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.121
Feel free to look around,

665
00:47:26.121 --> 00:47:28.331
and do ask me if you have any question.

666
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.760
It's...

667
00:47:32.461 --> 00:47:33.731
you, right?

668
00:47:33.961 --> 00:47:34.970
Pardon?

669
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:37.901
Have you also...

670
00:47:39.171 --> 00:47:41.110
been living ever since then?

671
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:44.380
Are you talking about the painting?

672
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.981
You're Jeom Bok, right?

673
00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:49.450
My name is Koo Jang Bin.

674
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:52.581
You didn't...

675
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.090
draw this painting?

676
00:47:55.891 --> 00:47:57.191
My grandfather's...

677
00:47:57.191 --> 00:47:59.961
grandfather's father painted it.

678
00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.231
Goodness gracious.

679
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.700
You're Jeom Bok's descendant.

680
00:48:09.901 --> 00:48:12.200
Did he leave something else other than this?

681
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.570
That's all.

682
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:18.110
Please try searching through your house.

683
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.380
There must be a long writing like novel...

684
00:48:22.651 --> 00:48:24.421
and a prayer somewhere in your house.

685
00:48:26.351 --> 00:48:28.450
Okay. I'll get going.

686
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.360
Mr. Moon, you're here.

687
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.030
- Hello. - Hello.

688
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.961
This is my exhibition. Please take a look.

689
00:48:41.271 --> 00:48:42.831
Please give me a minute.

690
00:48:44.101 --> 00:48:45.300
Hello.

691
00:48:47.041 --> 00:48:48.311
Goodness, Mr. Moon.

692
00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.410
What brings you here?

693
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:53.240
The painting called me here.

694
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:55.410
What about you?

695
00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.380
We're doing an exhibition project...

696
00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.481
with Hae Ra's travel agency.

697
00:48:59.481 --> 00:49:01.691
The curator over there is in the project too.

698
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:02.791
I see.

699
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.490
Let's look at the painting.

700
00:49:53.101 --> 00:49:55.110
It's such a beautiful painting, right?

701
00:49:58.081 --> 00:50:00.110
I keep tearing up.

702
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:11.061
He looks like Mr. Moon.

703
00:50:12.021 --> 00:50:14.191
- I know. - They really look alike.

704
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.660
Can I buy this painting?

705
00:50:18.331 --> 00:50:20.530
It's our family treasure.

706
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:21.700
I'm sorry.

707
00:50:23.601 --> 00:50:25.970
The woman looks like Ms. Jung, don't you think?

708
00:50:26.871 --> 00:50:29.371
Are you sure this was painted in Joseon Dynasty?

709
00:50:29.371 --> 00:50:30.711
Yes, I'm sure.

710
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:33.880
It's estimated to be painted in 1801...

711
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.110
around the Catholic Persecution.

712
00:50:39.751 --> 00:50:41.320
Thank you, Jeom Bok.

713
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.621
Please help me find...

714
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.621
the prayer soon as well.

715
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.621
She looks so pretty.

716
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:17.961
It's too awkward. I can't do this anymore.

717
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.160
The Blacksmith's people will arrive soon.

718
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.700
Wrap it up quickly and prepare for the meeting.

719
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.430
Must we really do this?

720
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.070
Circle Tour stole...

721
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.371
our custom renting idea and made a hit.

722
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:33.141
We should at least do this kind of event.

723
00:51:33.941 --> 00:51:35.610
We would've been doing that now...

724
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.240
if it hadn't been for you.

725
00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.081
What did I do?

726
00:51:39.081 --> 00:51:40.851
Keep taking photos.

727
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:42.050
Goodness.

728
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.481
Hurry up. It's embarrassing for us too.

729
00:51:45.851 --> 00:51:47.180
Okay.

730
00:51:49.351 --> 00:51:51.391
People from abroad will be interested so much...

731
00:51:51.391 --> 00:51:54.130
if we post our employee pictures like this.

732
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.490
You're right.

733
00:51:56.691 --> 00:51:58.401
Hello.

734
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:00.401
- Hello. - Goodness.

735
00:52:00.401 --> 00:52:01.771
Hello.

736
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:12.340
She looks so much like the woman in the painting.

737
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:18.550
You're watching the hard work of us, employees,

738
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:22.450
for the 50 percent increase in our sales.

739
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.731
It's hard to support our lives.

740
00:52:28.831 --> 00:52:31.260
Gosh, we're doing this because of you.

741
00:53:03.891 --> 00:53:05.601
It's pretty.

742
00:53:05.601 --> 00:53:08.001
You must've been used for the runway this time.

743
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.271
Now?

744
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:14.570
Hold on. I'll tell you as I look at the pictures.

745
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.470
I'll use your laptop for a minute.

746
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:17.510
All right.

747
00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:20.180
(Pictures of foreign hotel interior designs)

748
00:53:20.441 --> 00:53:21.950
I'm looking at the pictures now.

749
00:53:24.521 --> 00:53:26.151
Please hold. Let me write a note on this.

750
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.160
540 to 360.

751
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.791
(540 to 360)

752
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.700
Okay.

753
00:53:42.171 --> 00:53:44.740
(I'm a researcher who used to work with Doctor Moon.)

754
00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.200
(Doctor Moon was killed by his friend, Mr. Jung.)

755
00:53:50.541 --> 00:53:51.941
I'll call you again.

756
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.151
(Doctor Moon was killed by his friend, Mr. Jung.)

757
00:53:59.081 --> 00:54:00.151
Young Mi.

758
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.351
What?

759
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.430
What's this?

760
00:54:09.561 --> 00:54:10.800
Are you going to send this to someone?

761
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.160
Or did you already send it to someone?

762
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:15.570
I didn't. I just wrote it for nothing.

763
00:54:15.771 --> 00:54:17.740
You didn't send this to Hae Ra or Moon Soo Ho?

764
00:54:17.771 --> 00:54:18.800
No.

765
00:54:20.941 --> 00:54:22.510
I'll call the two...

766
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.510
and ask them if they got a strange text.

767
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:31.780
Are you crazy?

768
00:54:32.151 --> 00:54:34.251
Why did you... Whom did you send it to?

769
00:54:38.561 --> 00:54:39.760
To Moon Soo Ho.

770
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:43.360
I did it for you.

771
00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:46.831
Moon Soo Ho keeps suspecting your father.

772
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.541
I sent it as a restricted number. Don't worry.

773
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:53.200
He can't find the sender.

774
00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.141
Don't do this kind of stuff from now on.

775
00:54:56.771 --> 00:54:58.740
I did it because I love you.

776
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.450
I was worried your father might get into trouble.

777
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:04.220
Do you have any idea how much I care about you?

778
00:55:04.921 --> 00:55:06.351
I know,

779
00:55:07.251 --> 00:55:08.990
so don't this kind of stuff anymore.

780
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:11.561
Do you understand?

781
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.791
Okay.

782
00:55:24.641 --> 00:55:25.700
Hae Ra?

783
00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:34.981
I want to sleep here tonight.

784
00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:40.320
You can't do that yet.

785
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.521
It's too fluttering for me.

786
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.851
That's none of my business.

787
00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.831
It's not as big as my bed.

788
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:29.700
Hae Ra, open your eyes.

789
00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:14.610
Will you marry me?

790
00:57:37.231 --> 00:57:38.541
You have to give me an answer.

791
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:49.010
I never knew I'd be proposed to in my pajamas.

792
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:52.121
I never knew I'd propose to you in my pajamas.

793
00:57:55.151 --> 00:57:56.151
Soo Ho.

794
00:57:57.151 --> 00:57:58.160
Yes?

795
00:58:03.291 --> 00:58:05.061
I'll marry you.

796
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:12.101
I'll be...

797
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:15.271
the best husband in this world.

798
00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:10.090
I'm so happy.

799
00:59:11.461 --> 00:59:12.760
I'm so happy.

800
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:26.340
You were...

801
00:59:27.751 --> 00:59:29.450
my husband.

802
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:35.820
You'll remember me.

803
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:45.130
You were my husband.

804
00:59:47.771 --> 00:59:50.630
You must give me the love that you failed to give.

805
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:24.101
Try to remember me.
