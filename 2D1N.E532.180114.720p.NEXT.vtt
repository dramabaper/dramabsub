Where does he fit in terms of ranking?

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.684 line:93%
Tell us where we each rank.

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:24.725 line:93%

Three.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:35.564 line:93%
(It's not you.)

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:36.595 line:93%
Maria!

00:05:37.264 --> 00:05:38.405 line:93%
Oh, my Maria!

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:40.004 line:93%
Why am I fourth?

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:41.605 line:93%
(Glancing)

00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:42.905 line:93%
She keeps looking at your belly.

00:05:43.574 --> 00:05:45.674 line:93%
She does keep staring at them.

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:47.814 line:93%

- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:00.025 line:93%
- Let's enjoy. - It's because he's here.

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:01.025 line:93%
(Prickly)

00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:04.095 line:93%
Joon Ho didn't have a good night's sleep.

00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:05.624 line:93%
I still have jet-lag,

00:06:05.624 --> 00:06:07.564 line:93%
so I woke up at 4am today.

00:06:07.665 --> 00:06:10.405 line:93%

(Disgusted)

00:06:22.744 --> 00:06:23.785 line:93%
Did you bite your tongue?

00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:24.785 line:93%
Maria...

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:25.915 line:93%
(Flustered)

00:06:26.614 --> 00:06:28.754 line:93%
- What's wrong? - Is it salty?

00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:31.725 line:93%
Mine has wasabi.

00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:33.694 line:93%
- Wasabi? - There's some in mine.

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:35.694 line:93%
- You're mistaken. - Is that how it tastes?

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:37.264 line:93%
Of course. You startled me.

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:38.795 line:93%
- Mine's sweet. - I'm sorry.

00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:39.965 line:93%
It's the same.

00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:43.095 line:93%
- It's not. - It is.

00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:44.364 line:93%
Let me see.

00:06:44.364 --> 00:06:45.705 line:93%
(Defconn tries it.)

00:06:45.804 --> 00:06:46.804 line:93%
Here.

00:06:46.804 --> 00:06:48.405 line:93%
(A slight amount)

- Avocado and wasabi. - Can I try it?

00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:03.085 line:93%
(Really?)

00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:04.225 line:93%
Is mine the only one with it?

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:05.585 line:93%
(This isn't edible.)

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:06.585 line:93%
It's spicy.

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:08.955 line:93%
Gosh, that's spicy.

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.124 line:93%
(Goodness!)

00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:14.595 line:93%
- Maria! - Are yours like that?

00:07:14.994 --> 00:07:16.064 line:93%
(Confused)

00:07:16.064 --> 00:07:17.064 line:93%
Mine's all right.

00:07:17.064 --> 00:07:20.004 line:93%
What's with the flavors?

00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:22.335 line:93%
- How could you? - Why?

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:26.004 line:93%
(While the members slept,)

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:30.384 line:93%
(the morning angel prepared breakfast.)

00:07:31.415 --> 00:07:34.054 line:93%
(At first, he made it with love.)

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.785 line:93%
(But then he saw the color of the avocado.)

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:39.655 line:93%
(The avocado could be mistaken for...)

00:07:39.655 --> 00:07:41.324 line:93%
(wasabi.)

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:44.465 line:93%
(Yong Hwa knows the show well.)

00:07:44.994 --> 00:07:46.494 line:93%
(If that's what you'd like...)

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:48.134 line:93%
(Giggling)

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:50.364 line:93%
(It's hilarious that you had a tube of this.)

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.205 line:93%
(I respect you.)

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:58.705 line:93%
(For 10 years, you've traveled with it.)

00:08:00.374 --> 00:08:01.814 line:93%
(The colors match perfectly.)

00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:03.645 line:93%
Who would know?

00:08:03.645 --> 00:08:04.744 line:93%
(A big chunk)

00:08:04.744 --> 00:08:05.785 line:93%
This is incredible.

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:08.184 line:93%
(No one could figure it out.)

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:09.955 line:93%
(A dab)

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:11.754 line:93%
(He kindly gives it a taste.)

00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:16.754 line:93%
(It's spicy. It's really spicy.)

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:19.694 line:93%
(I'll add more.)

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:21.295 line:93%
(Mischievous)

00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:24.465 line:93%
(He even puts his muscles into it.)

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.774 line:93%
(He spreads it with love.)

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:29.504 line:93%
It's perfect.

00:08:29.504 --> 00:08:30.744 line:93%
(A perfect spread)

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:32.345 line:93%
(He's satisfied.)

00:08:33.144 --> 00:08:34.744 line:93%
(He even prepares a drink.)

00:08:36.175 --> 00:08:38.284 line:93%
(He wanted someone else to be unfortunate too.)

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.284 line:93%
(Salt)

00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:42.514 line:93%
(A huge amount of salt)

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:45.124 line:93%
(Mixing)

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.154 line:93%
(Smiling)

00:08:49.455 --> 00:08:51.325 line:93%
(He tastes it first this time as well.)

00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:52.825 line:93%
(Choking)

00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:54.534 line:93%
(He puts on his ugly face.)

00:08:55.864 --> 00:08:58.264 line:93%
(That's how the breakfast was made.)

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:00.675 line:93%
(The cheeky mastermind)

00:09:02.374 --> 00:09:04.244 line:93%
(When Joon Ho tasted the wasabi,)

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.945 line:93%
(he tried to confuse him.)

00:09:09.144 --> 00:09:13.144 line:93%
(He knew everything, but pretended not to.)

00:09:14.485 --> 00:09:15.555 line:93%
Gosh, it's spicy.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.624 line:93%
(Seeing the others receive his gift...)

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:21.524 line:93%
(gave him so much joy.)

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:22.695 line:93%
Spanish!

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:25.294 line:93%
I made it.

00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:26.394 line:93%
(I made it.)

00:09:28.864 --> 00:09:30.305 line:93%
- What? - I put it in.

00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:31.805 line:93%
- Really? - I made breakfast today.

00:09:32.164 --> 00:09:33.605 line:93%
Did you really make this?

00:09:33.935 --> 00:09:35.435 line:93%
So you knowingly chose your seat.

00:09:35.534 --> 00:09:36.575 line:93%
Yes.

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.044 line:93%
Since I'm the guest,

00:09:39.675 --> 00:09:41.014 line:93%
you wouldn't let me sit at the end.

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:42.874 line:93%
That's why I put both dishes at the end.

00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:45.044 line:93%
It's our fault for being too nice.

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:47.055 line:93%
What about this seat then?

00:09:47.055 --> 00:09:49.154 line:93%
There's nothing wrong with his food.

00:09:50.085 --> 00:09:51.185 line:93%
I want something proper to eat.

00:09:51.784 --> 00:09:53.425 line:93%
Since Yong Hwa came...

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:55.925 line:93%
all this way and prepared breakfast,

00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.124 line:93%
I'll give you one to share.

00:09:57.124 --> 00:09:58.864 line:93%
Let's have one eat it all then.

00:09:59.894 --> 00:10:01.565 line:93%
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

00:10:01.695 --> 00:10:02.965 line:93%
(You're out.)

00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:04.404 line:93%
- You're out. - You're out.

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:05.864 line:93%
(Bye!)

00:10:05.864 --> 00:10:07.404 line:93%
- You're out. - You're out.

00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:09.235 line:93%
(After a few more eliminations...)

00:10:09.874 --> 00:10:11.274 line:93%
Oh, my baby.

00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:13.374 line:93%
(Dong Gu is the final winner!)

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:17.345 line:93%
Congratulations, Dong Gu, baby.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.144 line:93%
Try it.

00:10:19.614 --> 00:10:21.284 line:93%
(Mouth-watering)

00:10:21.284 --> 00:10:23.085 line:93%
It's been a while since I ate ramyeon.

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.485 line:93%
(Slurping)

00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:27.195 line:93%
Can Joon Ho and I have some of the soup?

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:28.994 line:93%
(You...)

00:10:29.455 --> 00:10:30.494 line:93%
Take a sniff.

00:10:30.494 --> 00:10:31.565 line:93%
(Being cheeky)

00:10:32.124 --> 00:10:34.364 line:93%
- It smells delicious. - Express how it smells.

00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:35.965 line:93%
It seems like...

00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:38.435 line:93%
he can't play ball very well.

00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:40.675 line:93%
It's like Dong Gu who makes mistakes...

00:10:40.675 --> 00:10:42.004 line:93%
Forget it.

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:44.374 line:93%
Let me smell it.

00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:46.105 line:93%
Just smell it. Forget it.

00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:47.144 line:93%
It must smell strong.

00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:49.475 line:93%
It smells like the flavor of Seoul.

00:10:50.044 --> 00:10:51.114 line:93%
(That's correct.)

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:54.154 line:93%
I'll kick his ramyeon so no one can eat it.

00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:56.154 line:93%
Break it if you can't have it.

00:10:56.284 --> 00:10:57.425 line:93%
Is it enough?

00:10:57.425 --> 00:10:58.855 line:93%
- Let me try it. - I gave food too easily.

00:10:58.855 --> 00:11:00.154 line:93%
Let me try some.

00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:01.455 line:93%
It's against the rules on the show.

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:03.695 line:93%
I gave you food too easily yesterday.

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:04.695 line:93%
What did you eat?

00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:07.195 line:93%
We ate Thai... No, where are we?

00:11:07.195 --> 00:11:08.935 line:93%
- We're in Cuba. - I almost forgot.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.764 line:93%
Tell us one of the dishes.

00:11:12.565 --> 00:11:13.735 line:93%
(He ate a lot yesterday.)

00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:15.975 line:93%
We had a chicken dish.

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:17.274 line:93%
What was it called?

00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:18.774 line:93%
There was a word.

00:11:18.774 --> 00:11:19.845 line:93%
What?

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:20.845 line:93%
It was a Spanish word.

00:11:21.175 --> 00:11:22.244 line:93%
Skin?

00:11:23.075 --> 00:11:24.715 line:93%
Forget it. You can eat it all.

00:11:26.614 --> 00:11:28.685 line:93%
Take a look.

00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:30.055 line:93%
- Do you want some? - No.

00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:33.725 line:93%
- Really? - I'll eat the local food.

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:35.494 line:93%
You may ask for ramyeon tomorrow.

00:11:36.894 --> 00:11:37.894 line:93%
(Cuba)

00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:41.494 line:93%
(Kazakhstan)

00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:43.504 line:93%
(3rd morning in Kazakhstan)

00:11:44.205 --> 00:11:47.075 line:93%
(Under the strong sunlight,)

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:50.305 line:93%
(the members are deeply asleep.)

00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:53.075 line:93%
(However, they hear...)

00:11:53.774 --> 00:11:56.744 line:93%
(a familiar melody.)

00:11:57.445 --> 00:11:59.445 line:93%
(He checks his hair as soon as he wakes up.)

00:12:00.614 --> 00:12:03.414 line:93%
(What about my age?)

00:12:03.685 --> 00:12:04.754 line:93%
Is it live music?

00:12:07.095 --> 00:12:08.294 line:93%
Is someone playing?

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:09.494 line:93%
(Is this really happening?)

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:11.624 line:93%
Isn't it recorded?

00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:14.935 line:93%
(Let's go outside first.)

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:18.534 line:93%
Is it live music?

00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:23.134 line:93%
(Find where the morning song is playing.)

00:12:23.975 --> 00:12:25.445 line:93%
(Is someone calling from outside?)

00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:27.914 line:93%
(Empty)

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.014 line:93%
How would I know where it's coming from?

00:12:32.884 --> 00:12:34.914 line:93%
(Then he finds something.)

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.225 line:93%
(It's a red line.)

00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:42.294 line:93%
(It seems connected to the speakers.)

00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:44.695 line:93%
(He arrives at a building.)

00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:47.335 line:93%
(In a foreign land,)

00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:50.435 line:93%
(why do I hear a Korean song?)

00:12:55.735 --> 00:12:57.205 line:93%
(He bows.)

00:12:59.004 --> 00:13:01.044 line:93%
(It's nice to meet you.)

00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:04.144 line:93%
(It's a Kazakh morning song chorus.)

00:13:04.815 --> 00:13:05.945 line:93%
(What's going on here?)

00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:07.284 line:93%
Hurry up here.

00:13:07.884 --> 00:13:09.455 line:93%
(The other two arrive.)

00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:11.825 line:93%
(He's stunned.)

00:13:12.955 --> 00:13:14.524 line:93%
(Wasn't it a recording?)

00:13:15.055 --> 00:13:16.624 line:93%
(Goodness)

00:13:18.394 --> 00:13:19.894 line:93%
(Jong Min arrives last.)

00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:21.764 line:93%
(He's also stunned.)

00:13:23.534 --> 00:13:26.705 line:93%

00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:31.975 line:93%
(Four beats)

00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:36.514 line:93%
Good job.

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:38.414 line:93%
This is Silky Road Chorus.

00:13:38.414 --> 00:13:39.644 line:93%

00:14:15.284 --> 00:14:17.725 line:93%
Were your parents Korean?

00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:19.225 line:93%
- Grandmother. - Grandmother?

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.425 line:93%
Grandmother.

00:14:20.524 --> 00:14:22.455 line:93%
They're grandparents were Korean.

00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:25.325 line:93%
(The end of Joseon Dynasty was messy.)

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:28.565 line:93%
(Japanese colonial period was painful.)

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:32.404 line:93%
(We overcame poverty and Japanese exploitation.)

00:14:32.864 --> 00:14:35.274 line:93%
(To fight for Korea's independence,)

00:14:35.705 --> 00:14:39.144 line:93%
(Koreans migrated to Primorsky Krai.)

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:43.215 line:93%
(Koreans settled in Primorsky Krai.)

00:14:44.815 --> 00:14:47.215 line:93%
(In 1937, they were forced to move.)

00:14:48.914 --> 00:14:54.695 line:93%
(170,000 Koreans move to Central Asia.)

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:57.024 line:93%
Koreans moved to Primorsky Krai...

00:14:57.024 --> 00:14:58.624 line:93%
not because they did something wrong.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.864 line:93%
It was hard to distinguish them from Japanese.

00:15:01.864 --> 00:15:04.134 line:93%
- Is that why? - That was why.

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:07.975 line:93%
As they could be spies in disguise,

00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:11.705 line:93%
they were forced to move to Central Asia.

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:15.315 line:93%
All Korean Russians had a difficult life.

00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:18.585 line:93%
We were hungry and lived in poor condition.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.215 line:93%
Many Kazakhs helped us.

00:15:20.215 --> 00:15:21.215 line:93%
It must have been cold.

00:15:21.215 --> 00:15:24.485 line:93%
There was one purpose for Korean Russians.

00:15:24.485 --> 00:15:28.355 line:93%
We wanted to survive with our children...

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:31.294 line:93%
and give them a chance to learn.

00:15:31.294 --> 00:15:35.134 line:93%
Due to their effort, all of us were well educated.

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:37.534 line:93%
We became teachers, doctors, and accountants.

00:15:39.164 --> 00:15:42.904 line:93%
My parents missed Korea all their lives.

00:15:42.904 --> 00:15:44.374 line:93%
However,

00:15:44.374 --> 00:15:47.475 line:93%
at that time, they couldn't go anywhere.

00:15:47.575 --> 00:15:51.085 line:93%
They died before they could visit Korea again.

00:15:51.085 --> 00:15:52.945 line:93%
My grandparents told my parents...

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:55.384 line:93%
how beautiful...

00:15:56.254 --> 00:15:58.855 line:93%
our historical hometown is.

00:16:00.154 --> 00:16:02.195 line:93%
Their grandparents told their parents...

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:05.494 line:93%
how beautiful...

00:16:05.494 --> 00:16:07.835 line:93%
our historical hometown is.

00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:13.735 line:93%
(The blue color that they couldn't see again)

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:17.544 line:93%
(They won't hear the sounds of leaves again.)

00:16:18.605 --> 00:16:21.044 line:93%
(They had to survive in a foreign land.)

00:16:21.044 --> 00:16:22.315 line:93%
It's beautiful.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.114 line:93%
(They missed the beautiful colors of Korea.)

00:16:24.114 --> 00:16:25.284 line:93%
It's like an ink wash painting.

00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:29.315 line:93%
(Many Korean immigrants are forgotten in time.)

00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:32.384 line:93%
We're proud of...

00:16:32.384 --> 00:16:34.555 line:93%
our ancestors' home.

00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.294 line:93%
I visited last year.

00:16:36.294 --> 00:16:37.764 line:93%
I was overwhelmed...

00:16:37.764 --> 00:16:38.764 line:93%
- Last year? - with emotions.

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.164 line:93%
She was moved.

00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:41.794 line:93%
What moved you?

00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:45.835 line:93%
It was orderly and clean.

00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:50.175 line:93%
I thought it was a country for the people.

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.374 line:93%
Right.

00:16:51.374 --> 00:16:53.075 line:93%
I'm proud...

00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:55.544 line:93%
of Koreans for being smart.

00:16:55.544 --> 00:16:57.284 line:93%
It's because Koreans are smart.

00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:01.385 line:93%
We're proud that we have Korean blood.

00:17:01.385 --> 00:17:05.324 line:93%
Whether it's Koreans in Korea...

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:08.425 line:93%
or Korean Russians living in Kazakhstan.

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:13.735 line:93%
We like you, and we're proud of you.

00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:20.975 line:93%
You may eat and continue the conversation.

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:22.304 line:93%
We'll make some for you.

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:26.145 line:93%
(They make breakfast.)

00:17:28.574 --> 00:17:29.615 line:93%
It's delicious.

00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:31.584 line:93%
- It's delicious. - Is it?

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:32.945 line:93%
It's delicious.

00:17:34.715 --> 00:17:37.385 line:93%
Do you eat kimchi jjigae or doenjang jjigae?

00:17:37.385 --> 00:17:39.324 line:93%
Yes, we eat a lot of soup like...

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:40.455 line:93%
kimchi jjigae.

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.094 line:93%
(Someone approaches the staff members.)

00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:46.165 line:93%
(She shares food in case they're hungry.)

00:17:47.064 --> 00:17:48.094 line:93%
Try some.

00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:51.504 line:93%
(His mouth waters.)

00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:53.504 line:93%
Try some.

00:17:53.504 --> 00:17:54.705 line:93%
(She feeds those whose hands are occupied.)

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:56.475 line:93%
Isn't it delicious?

00:17:57.044 --> 00:17:58.804 line:93%
(They take care of everyone.)

00:17:58.804 --> 00:18:00.145 line:93%
Try some of this.

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:01.415 line:93%
What is it? Is it made with potatoes?

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:03.885 line:93%
It's made with potato starch.

00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:06.244 line:93%
There's pork and cabbage in it.

00:18:06.244 --> 00:18:08.715 line:93%
We call it potato baegoja.

00:18:09.014 --> 00:18:10.225 line:93%
Potato baegoja?

00:18:10.225 --> 00:18:11.485 line:93%
It's what we call it.

00:18:11.485 --> 00:18:13.185 line:93%
- I see. - Let me have some.

00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:14.254 line:93%
Try it.

00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:15.625 line:93%
(He takes a bite.)

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.824 line:93%
- It's delicious. - Is it delicious?

00:18:18.824 --> 00:18:21.564 line:93%
- One Night. - Two Days.

00:18:21.564 --> 00:18:22.564 line:93%
(We'll remember you.)

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:25.104 line:93%
(30 minutes ago)

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.405 line:93%
It's nice to meet you. I watch the show often.

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:28.735 line:93%
One Night Two Days.

00:18:28.735 --> 00:18:30.274 line:93%
I've seen you on TV.

00:18:30.274 --> 00:18:31.504 line:93%
How about...

00:18:31.905 --> 00:18:33.844 line:93%
I've watched it a lot.

00:18:33.844 --> 00:18:34.844 line:93%

Are you my fan, by any chance?

00:18:41.385 --> 00:18:42.814 line:93%
(Are you my fan, by any chance?)

00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:46.054 line:93%
(They were excited in the beginning.)

00:18:47.094 --> 00:18:48.824 line:93%
(He expected a huge welcome.)

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.225 line:93%
(He styles his hair perfectly for his fans.)

00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:53.425 line:93%
(What's going on?)

00:18:54.435 --> 00:18:55.435 line:93%
(Why is there no one?)

00:18:56.764 --> 00:18:58.235 line:93%
(It's not crowded.)

00:18:58.705 --> 00:18:59.705 line:93%
(Won't you wash your hair?)

00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:03.304 line:93%
(He keeps his hairstyle until he meets a fan.)

00:19:04.104 --> 00:19:05.844 line:93%
(Are you my fan?)

00:19:06.804 --> 00:19:07.814 line:93%
(I don't know him.)

00:19:10.014 --> 00:19:11.014 line:93%
(You said we're famous.)

00:19:11.415 --> 00:19:13.685 line:93%
(He forbids himself from washing his hair.)

00:19:14.215 --> 00:19:16.485 line:93%
(He regrets it.)

00:19:19.524 --> 00:19:22.794 line:93%
(He falls into his own trap.)

00:19:24.195 --> 00:19:26.294 line:93%
(Will she help him wash his hair?)

00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:28.965 line:93%
(Are you my fan and a shampoo fairy?)

00:19:29.564 --> 00:19:30.935 line:93%
(Please)

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:33.304 line:93%
Of course.

00:19:57.365 --> 00:19:58.365 line:93%
I must wash it.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.524 line:93%
It's too greasy.

00:19:59.524 --> 00:20:00.564 line:93%
Let me see the back.

00:20:00.564 --> 00:20:02.794 line:93%

Go and wash it.

00:20:04.935 --> 00:20:06.205 line:93%
How long has it been?

00:20:06.435 --> 00:20:07.905 line:93%
50 hours and 20 minutes.

00:20:08.304 --> 00:20:09.504 line:93%
The hair is the same.

00:20:10.274 --> 00:20:11.504 line:93%
It's an amazing friend.

00:20:12.274 --> 00:20:13.274 line:93%
Let's go.

00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:15.975 line:93%
(It's finally the time to wash the hair.)

00:20:15.975 --> 00:20:16.985 line:93%
Goodness.

00:20:16.985 --> 00:20:18.014 line:93%
(Tae Hyun gave him some shampoo.)

00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:21.314 line:93%
(Like a religious ceremony,)

00:20:21.314 --> 00:20:23.584 line:93%
(he washes every strand thoroughly.)

00:20:23.584 --> 00:20:25.655 line:93%
Gosh, it's very...

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:26.925 line:93%
Look at the hair loss.

00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:30.895 line:93%
I started the show in my 20s.

00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:33.935 line:93%
In my 40s, I'm starting to lose hair.

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:35.764 line:93%
Look at this.

00:20:35.764 --> 00:20:37.304 line:93%
(He sends a video letter to the viewers.)

00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:40.975 line:93%
The viewers are getting older,

00:20:41.135 --> 00:20:42.905 line:93%
and I'm getting older too.

00:20:43.235 --> 00:20:44.574 line:93%
That hurt.

00:20:44.574 --> 00:20:45.574 line:93%
(That was an unexpected attack.)

00:20:46.774 --> 00:20:49.415 line:93%
(Feeling refreshed in 3 days)

00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:51.084 line:93%
Done.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.215 line:93%
(Squeaky clean)

00:20:52.215 --> 00:20:53.215 line:93%
Finished.

00:20:54.685 --> 00:20:56.215 line:93%
Do you want to make another pledge?

00:20:56.215 --> 00:20:57.225 line:93%
No.

00:20:57.225 --> 00:20:58.584 line:93%
(There won't be any more pledges in my life.)

00:20:58.584 --> 00:20:59.625 line:93%
No more pledges.

00:21:02.425 --> 00:21:03.594 line:93%
(Kazakhstan)

00:21:05.824 --> 00:21:07.534 line:93%
(Cuba)

00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:08.965 line:93%
What will we do today?

00:21:08.965 --> 00:21:11.135 line:93%
Yong Hwa is here now.

00:21:11.135 --> 00:21:13.604 line:93%
Do you remember the DVD...

00:21:13.604 --> 00:21:15.935 line:93%
- Dong Gu found yesterday? - Yes.

00:21:15.935 --> 00:21:16.945 line:93%
It's related to that.

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:19.675 line:93%
(In the exciting city of Havana,)

00:21:19.675 --> 00:21:22.215 line:93%
(they found Korean Wave star Dong Gu.)

00:21:22.844 --> 00:21:25.084 line:93%
- Today's theme is that. - What is it?

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:28.915 line:93%
We invited Yong Hwa all the way here in Cuba,

00:21:28.915 --> 00:21:32.925 line:93%
because he's the top 2 Korean celebrity...

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:34.754 line:93%
- chosen by Cuban fans. - Really?

00:21:34.754 --> 00:21:37.465 line:93%
- Top 2? - You're famous.

00:21:37.594 --> 00:21:39.425 line:93%
Thank you.

00:21:39.425 --> 00:21:42.034 line:93%
You'll go out with Yong Hwa,

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:45.135 line:93%
and experience how popular Korean Wave is in Cuba.

00:21:45.135 --> 00:21:47.074 line:93%
Will people swarm toward us?

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.604 line:93%
Don't trust me too much.

00:21:49.405 --> 00:21:50.405 line:93%
Let's go.

00:21:50.774 --> 00:21:52.504 line:93%
Will Joon Ho and I become...

00:21:52.544 --> 00:21:54.475 line:93%
the ugly squid and filefish again?

00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:57.544 line:93%
Yesterday, Dong Gu made us look ugly.

00:21:57.544 --> 00:22:00.084 line:93%
They cut us out from the picture.

00:22:00.685 --> 00:22:03.284 line:93%
(They take pictures with Dong Gu only.)

00:22:04.225 --> 00:22:06.925 line:93%
(Cuban squid and filefish)

00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:10.195 line:93%
I hope someone recognizes me.

00:22:11.594 --> 00:22:13.195 line:93%
Squid and filefish will sit in the back.

00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:17.334 line:93%
They're seeing us off today.

00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:18.735 line:93%
- Me? - Dong Gu.

00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:20.504 line:93%
Okay.

00:22:20.504 --> 00:22:22.475 line:93%
(They take pictures with Yong Hwa and Dong Gu.)

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:23.675 line:93%
Thank you.

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:24.975 line:93%
(Squid and filefish are left out.)

00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:28.344 line:93%
Let's experience the Korean Wave today.

00:22:28.344 --> 00:22:30.584 line:93%
Why do you think I'm not wearing my hat?

00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:33.215 line:93%
Why did I style my hair?

00:22:33.215 --> 00:22:34.754 line:93%
You look like a CEO of an agency.

00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:36.084 line:93%
(Laughing)

00:22:36.084 --> 00:22:37.125 line:93%
That's funny.

00:22:37.655 --> 00:22:39.524 line:93%
(The place of Korean Wave...)

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:41.854 line:93%
(they're headed to with huge expectation is...)

00:22:41.854 --> 00:22:42.955 line:93%
What? It's just a house.

00:22:42.955 --> 00:22:44.125 line:93%
(Just a house?)

00:22:44.594 --> 00:22:45.925 line:93%
How can we check Korean Wave here?

00:22:47.094 --> 00:22:48.534 line:93%
(A mysterious building is waiting for them.)

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:51.804 line:93%
The building you're standing in front of is...

00:22:52.034 --> 00:22:56.435 line:93%
the Cuban Korean Center which opened in 2014.

00:22:56.435 --> 00:22:57.844 line:93%
Really?

00:22:57.975 --> 00:23:01.544 line:93%
It's used as a place to strengthen the ties...

00:23:01.544 --> 00:23:04.485 line:93%
and relationships for 1,200 Cuban Koreans.

00:23:04.715 --> 00:23:07.685 line:93%
Cubans who are interested in Korea also come here...

00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:10.284 line:93%
to take language classes, and cooking classes...

00:23:10.284 --> 00:23:12.284 line:93%
to experience Korean culture.

00:23:12.284 --> 00:23:13.425 line:93%
Is that so?

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:17.365 line:93%
Maybe we can help them in some way.

00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:21.034 line:93%
So this is the Cuban Korean Center.

00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:23.935 line:93%
(A space inside the center...)

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:27.834 line:93%
(for Korean culture and history.)

00:23:29.504 --> 00:23:32.645 line:93%
Joon Ho. Do you remember this?

00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:34.574 line:93%
- We saw it in a book. - Is that right?

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:36.844 line:93%
(They saw the same picture...)

00:23:36.844 --> 00:23:40.314 line:93%
(in a bookstore in Obispo Street.)

00:23:40.814 --> 00:23:42.455 line:93%
- Park Yi Soo. - These are...

00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:45.524 line:93%
the first Koreans who settled in Cuba.

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:46.994 line:93%
He was the first...

00:23:46.994 --> 00:23:48.554 line:93%
president of Korean Association.

00:23:48.554 --> 00:23:50.665 line:93%
This is an old passport.

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:53.264 line:93%
Nationality. Korea.

00:23:54.594 --> 00:23:59.064 line:93%
These people immigrated to Cuba.

00:23:59.205 --> 00:24:00.375 line:93%
They already passed away.

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:03.235 line:93%
We invited a daughter of one of the past...

00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:04.544 line:93%
- presidents. - Really?

00:24:04.774 --> 00:24:06.774 line:93%
- Hello. - Hello.

00:24:07.215 --> 00:24:10.244 line:93%
- Please come this way. - Hi, I'm Nimiya.

00:24:10.445 --> 00:24:11.445 line:93%
It's nice to meet you.

00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:14.584 line:93%
A lot of Korean descendants...

00:24:14.584 --> 00:24:16.014 line:93%
like Korean culture.

00:24:16.014 --> 00:24:18.455 line:93%
Surprisingly, many Cubans...

00:24:18.455 --> 00:24:23.354 line:93%
who aren't of Korean descent...

00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:29.635 line:93%
love Korean drama and music.

00:24:30.865 --> 00:24:35.504 line:93%
Fans are gathered outside.

00:24:35.675 --> 00:24:37.145 line:93%
(They are waiting outside the building.)

00:24:37.675 --> 00:24:39.945 line:93%
Do they know who is coming?

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:42.544 line:93%
They think we're filming a documentary.

00:24:43.514 --> 00:24:45.215 line:93%
It'll be a surprise event.

00:24:45.215 --> 00:24:48.455 line:93%
Let's make it a big surprise for them.

00:24:49.215 --> 00:24:51.024 line:93%
(They believe it's a documentary shoot.)

00:24:54.494 --> 00:24:56.925 line:93%
(Yong Hwa is waiting alone.)

00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:59.365 line:93%
I'm feeling nervous for no reason.

00:25:01.094 --> 00:25:02.635 line:93%
(The others are waiting in a different room.)

00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:04.304 line:93%
Mr. Filefish.

00:25:04.534 --> 00:25:06.975 line:93%
(Joon Ho is overly excited.)

00:25:07.334 --> 00:25:09.475 line:93%
(One Night Two Days)

00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:12.774 line:93%
(Joon Ho goes out first for the big surprise.)

00:25:13.244 --> 00:25:16.244 line:93%
(Last week, nobody recognized him,)

00:25:16.244 --> 00:25:18.685 line:93%
(so he became a camera man.)

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:22.185 line:93%
(Today, I'm a Korean Wave star.)

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:24.324 line:93%
(But here,)

00:25:24.324 --> 00:25:26.754 line:93%
(they'll recognize me for sure.)

00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:30.395 line:93%
(They're not even turning around.)

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:32.225 line:93%
Hi.

00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:33.365 line:93%
Hi.

00:25:33.534 --> 00:25:35.665 line:93%
- Hi. - Hi.

00:25:35.665 --> 00:25:36.695 line:93%
Hi.

00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:37.865 line:93%
(Well...)

00:25:38.405 --> 00:25:40.675 line:93%
I'm Joon Ho. Kim Joon Ho.

00:25:41.205 --> 00:25:42.205 line:93%
(Who is he?)

00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:45.544 line:93%
There's no sound.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.715 line:93%
That's going to be me in a minute.

00:25:48.774 --> 00:25:50.514 line:93%
(He ends up filming a documentary.)

00:25:50.514 --> 00:25:51.784 line:93%
I'm a Korean comedian.

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:54.584 line:93%
- It's nice to see you. - Nice to meet you.

00:25:54.584 --> 00:25:55.715 line:93%
Hi.

00:25:56.385 --> 00:25:57.385 line:93%
Hello.

00:25:57.655 --> 00:25:58.925 line:93%
(Not happy)

00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:01.425 line:93%
- Do you know Korean? - Little bit.

00:26:01.494 --> 00:26:03.324 line:93%
Do you speak a little bit of Korean?

00:26:03.324 --> 00:26:05.195 line:93%
Yes, I can.

00:26:05.395 --> 00:26:08.534 line:93%
My friends are here. I should call them out.

00:26:08.665 --> 00:26:09.895 line:93%
My friend...

00:26:10.604 --> 00:26:12.735 line:93%
(He didn't come here alone?)

00:26:13.604 --> 00:26:15.274 line:93%
My friend...

00:26:15.304 --> 00:26:18.504 line:93%
(When Joon Ho was demoted to a camera man,)

00:26:19.074 --> 00:26:23.314 line:93%
(Defconn was his filefish friend.)

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:26.215 line:93%
(Let me introduce my friend.)

00:26:26.215 --> 00:26:27.685 line:93%
(Come out, Mr. Filefish.)

00:26:27.685 --> 00:26:29.784 line:93%
- Who is it? - Good morning.

00:26:31.685 --> 00:26:35.895 line:93%
(This is how they actually reacted.)

00:26:37.895 --> 00:26:39.225 line:93%
(Frozen)

00:26:39.865 --> 00:26:43.504 line:93%
(Shocked)

00:26:44.504 --> 00:26:45.604 line:93%
Gosh.

00:26:45.834 --> 00:26:46.935 line:93%
(Surprised)

00:26:49.205 --> 00:26:50.604 line:93%
(Amazing)

00:26:51.544 --> 00:26:53.574 line:93%
(Praise Defconn!)

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:56.415 line:93%
(Welcome me!)

00:26:59.415 --> 00:27:00.415 line:93%
What?

00:27:01.715 --> 00:27:03.254 line:93%
(Goodness)

00:27:03.925 --> 00:27:04.925 line:93%
Do you know me?

00:27:04.925 --> 00:27:06.225 line:93%
- Yes! - Yes!

00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:07.754 line:93%
They're about to cry.

00:27:07.824 --> 00:27:09.725 line:93%
Film this!

00:27:09.725 --> 00:27:11.324 line:93%
They're crying because of Defconn.

00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:13.365 line:93%
I can't believe this.

00:27:14.235 --> 00:27:15.294 line:93%
(Laughing)

00:27:16.665 --> 00:27:18.465 line:93%
Defconn must be so excited.

00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:21.705 line:93%
I love Cuba.

00:27:21.705 --> 00:27:23.705 line:93%
Wait a minute.

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:27.344 line:93%
Wait a minute. We have another friend.

00:27:27.344 --> 00:27:29.074 line:93%
(One more friend?)

00:27:29.175 --> 00:27:30.544 line:93%
(Heightened anticipation)

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:33.514 line:93%
- Hey, friend. - I feel pressured.

00:27:33.715 --> 00:27:35.955 line:93%
- Hey, friend. Come on! - Hey, friend.

00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:38.784 line:93%
(Come out, pretty boy Dong Gu!)

00:27:40.594 --> 00:27:41.594 line:93%
Good morning, everyone!

00:27:43.494 --> 00:27:47.264 line:93%
(They greet him with excitement and passion.)

00:27:47.865 --> 00:27:49.334 line:93%
(Let me touch him!)

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:52.034 line:93%
(This is their actual reaction.)

00:27:53.935 --> 00:27:55.875 line:93%
She's crying.

00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:57.475 line:93%
My friend.

00:27:57.945 --> 00:27:59.604 line:93%
(Screaming)

00:28:01.314 --> 00:28:02.544 line:93%
Poor Joon Ho.

00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:04.145 line:93%
Do you know him?

00:28:04.145 --> 00:28:05.945 line:93%
(Are you talking about our Joon Ho?)

00:28:06.385 --> 00:28:08.615 line:93%
(He went out with a bright smile,)

00:28:08.615 --> 00:28:10.925 line:93%
(but nobody greeted him.)

00:28:10.925 --> 00:28:13.284 line:93%
(Yet they cheered for Defconn.)

00:28:13.284 --> 00:28:17.094 line:93%
(Eventually Joon Ho turned his back.)

00:28:17.824 --> 00:28:20.695 line:93%
(Of course the fans screamed for Dong Gu.)

00:28:21.465 --> 00:28:23.094 line:93%
(So Joon Ho...)

00:28:23.094 --> 00:28:24.405 line:93%
(lost his Mr. Filefish friend.)

00:28:24.935 --> 00:28:28.534 line:93%
(He became the lonely, dry squid.)

00:28:28.534 --> 00:28:31.844 line:93%
Do you know that we're on the same show?

00:28:31.844 --> 00:28:32.844 line:93%
- Yes. - I know.

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:34.774 line:93%
Do you know One Night Two Days?

00:28:34.774 --> 00:28:37.244 line:93%
When Joon Ho came out,

00:28:37.244 --> 00:28:38.784 line:93%
why didn't you cheer?

00:28:39.744 --> 00:28:41.584 line:93%
Why didn't you?

00:28:42.115 --> 00:28:43.655 line:93%
(Here you go!)

00:28:45.324 --> 00:28:46.584 line:93%
I'm mad.

00:28:46.584 --> 00:28:48.695 line:93%
Who did you think he was when he came out?

00:28:49.655 --> 00:28:52.125 line:93%
- Lee Min Ho? - No.

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:55.635 line:93%
- No. - Don't be upset.

00:28:55.794 --> 00:28:59.604 line:93%
It's One Night Two Days' 10-year anniversary.

00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:01.475 line:93%
So we came here to see you.

00:29:01.475 --> 00:29:05.804 line:93%
Which Korean celebrity do you like?

00:29:05.804 --> 00:29:06.945 line:93%
Actors or singers.

00:29:07.115 --> 00:29:10.215 line:93%

00:29:11.814 --> 00:29:13.215 line:93%
(We love BTS!)

00:29:14.084 --> 00:29:15.584 line:93%
(Dancing)

00:29:15.985 --> 00:29:17.885 line:93%

00:36:53.245 --> 00:36:55.175 line:93%
Let me tell you one more thing.

00:36:55.314 --> 00:36:57.644 line:93%
The camera crews won't follow you.

00:36:57.644 --> 00:36:58.684 line:93%
You'll go alone.

00:37:00.144 --> 00:37:02.555 line:93%
(They can't believe their ears.)

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.655 line:93%
It's like a selfie-video.

00:37:05.655 --> 00:37:07.454 line:93%
(He's preoccupied with the mission.)

00:37:09.095 --> 00:37:10.095 line:93%
I give up.

00:37:11.794 --> 00:37:13.635 line:93%
I'll sleep outdoors. Please take me with you.

00:37:14.434 --> 00:37:15.495 line:93%
Bring me with you.

00:37:15.595 --> 00:37:17.765 line:93%
- I'm so afraid. - What are you afraid of?

00:37:18.405 --> 00:37:19.834 line:93%
(He looks confident.)

00:37:20.874 --> 00:37:23.845 line:93%
We have three starting points,

00:37:23.845 --> 00:37:27.345 line:93%
but one of them is 3km farther than others.

00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:28.945 line:93%
(3km?)

00:37:29.445 --> 00:37:32.715 line:93%
You'll draw lots to decide where to start.

00:37:33.385 --> 00:37:34.454 line:93%
I'll go first.

00:37:35.254 --> 00:37:36.314 line:93%
Pick one and give it to me.

00:37:36.885 --> 00:37:37.985 line:93%
It's the shopping mall.

00:37:39.124 --> 00:37:41.254 line:93%
(Almaty Korea Education Institute)

00:37:41.825 --> 00:37:42.854 line:93%
Nazarbayev Park.

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:44.965 line:93%
It's 3km farther.

00:37:44.965 --> 00:37:46.164 line:93%
(It catches their eyes.)

00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:48.235 line:93%
It says in here.

00:37:48.235 --> 00:37:49.695 line:93%
(What did I just do?)

00:37:50.265 --> 00:37:53.305 line:93%
(They move to the starting points.)

00:37:53.735 --> 00:37:55.575 line:93%
(They arrive at their starting points.)

00:37:57.644 --> 00:38:00.245 line:93%
This is your destination.

00:38:02.245 --> 00:38:03.245 line:93%
It's money.

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.144 line:93%
(Is it his destination?)

00:38:05.144 --> 00:38:06.414 line:93%
- Is this the destination? - Yes.

00:38:07.115 --> 00:38:11.155 line:93%
(He's the worst coward.)

00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:14.624 line:93%
(He doesn't even know about emojis.)

00:38:14.624 --> 00:38:15.894 line:93%
(He's bad with smart devices.)

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:18.294 line:93%
(He's the most likely to come in last.)

00:38:18.894 --> 00:38:21.635 line:93%
Where is it? It has two places in it.

00:38:23.905 --> 00:38:26.564 line:93%
(He's not good with directions.)

00:38:27.675 --> 00:38:29.604 line:93%
(He can't speak foreign languages.)

00:38:30.175 --> 00:38:32.504 line:93%
(And he's 3km farther from the destination.)

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.075 line:93%
(Jong Min is also likely to come in last.)

00:38:35.874 --> 00:38:36.914 line:93%
What should I do?

00:38:37.184 --> 00:38:38.684 line:93%
Which one is the destination?

00:38:39.144 --> 00:38:43.184 line:93%
(He speaks a few foreign languages.)

00:38:43.584 --> 00:38:47.294 line:93%
(He's good at finding ways.)

00:38:49.325 --> 00:38:51.995 line:93%
(Heavy favorite, Genius Jung)

00:38:53.294 --> 00:38:55.235 line:93%
(What's their destination?)

00:38:55.735 --> 00:38:56.905 line:93%
You can leave now.

00:38:58.164 --> 00:39:00.274 line:93%
Where should I go?

00:39:02.774 --> 00:39:04.474 line:93%
(He doesn't know what to do.)

00:39:06.274 --> 00:39:07.314 line:93%
I should ask my way.

00:39:07.314 --> 00:39:09.144 line:93%
(He finds someone to help him.)

00:39:10.044 --> 00:39:11.115 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.785 line:93%
Where is it?

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:14.954 line:93%
- Hotel. - What?

00:39:15.215 --> 00:39:16.254 line:93%
- This one? - Yes.

00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:17.754 line:93%
- It's a hotel. - A hotel?

00:39:17.754 --> 00:39:18.825 line:93%
Hotel.

00:39:18.954 --> 00:39:20.155 line:93%
It's Hotel Kazakhstan.

00:39:20.354 --> 00:39:21.655 line:93%
Hotel Kazakhstan?

00:39:22.155 --> 00:39:23.325 line:93%
(Genius Jung starts searching it on the web.)

00:39:23.325 --> 00:39:24.325 line:93%
It's here.

00:39:25.064 --> 00:39:26.965 line:93%
This is the building in the bill.

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:28.965 line:93%
I found it. It's Hotel Kazakhstan.

00:39:29.064 --> 00:39:30.934 line:93%
(The building on the back of a 500 tenge bill)

00:39:31.265 --> 00:39:33.934 line:93%
(Today's destination is Hotel Kazakhstan.)

00:39:35.374 --> 00:39:37.805 line:93%
(It's a landmark of Kazakhstan...)

00:39:37.805 --> 00:39:40.374 line:93%
(where you can look down the city.)

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:47.015 line:93%
(1st place will sleep in this hotel room.)

00:39:47.914 --> 00:39:50.854 line:93%
(He's the farthest from the destination.)

00:39:52.285 --> 00:39:53.954 line:93%
I have to find out the name of the place...

00:39:53.954 --> 00:39:56.195 line:93%
so I can figure out what transportation to take.

00:39:57.124 --> 00:39:58.195 line:93%
It's not here.

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:02.865 line:93%
(Time passes helplessly.)

00:40:04.504 --> 00:40:06.265 line:93%
It's Hotel Kazakhstan.

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:07.604 line:93%
Okay.

00:40:07.604 --> 00:40:08.675 line:93%
(He finally figured out the destination.)

00:40:09.735 --> 00:40:10.845 line:93%
Where can I take the bus?

00:40:10.845 --> 00:40:12.075 line:93%
(Tae Hyun checks the translation app.)

00:40:12.075 --> 00:40:13.104 line:93%
Bus.

00:40:14.814 --> 00:40:15.845 line:93%
Thank you.

00:40:15.845 --> 00:40:16.914 line:93%
(He thanks the app.)

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:18.414 line:93%
(Silent)

00:40:18.414 --> 00:40:19.445 line:93%
Thank you.

00:40:19.684 --> 00:40:21.385 line:93%
(The app betrays him.)

00:40:22.615 --> 00:40:23.624 line:93%
Hotel Kazakhstan.

00:40:23.624 --> 00:40:25.124 line:93%
(Tae Hyun moves to take a bus.)

00:40:25.655 --> 00:40:27.495 line:93%
Does this bus go to Hotel Kazakhstan?

00:40:28.894 --> 00:40:30.224 line:93%
(He finally arrives at the bus stop.)

00:40:30.224 --> 00:40:32.394 line:93%
Excuse me. Hotel Kazakhstan?

00:40:32.394 --> 00:40:34.035 line:93%
- What? - Hotel Kazakhstan?

00:40:34.035 --> 00:40:35.595 line:93%
- Hotel Kazakhstan? - Thank you.

00:40:35.664 --> 00:40:37.664 line:93%
Can you speak English?

00:40:37.805 --> 00:40:38.834 line:93%
Oh, yes.

00:40:40.635 --> 00:40:44.544 line:93%
I want to go to Hotel Kazakhstan.

00:40:44.544 --> 00:40:45.774 line:93%
This is the bus you should take.

00:40:46.604 --> 00:40:48.144 line:93%
- Bus number 123. - 123?

00:40:48.144 --> 00:40:49.215 line:93%
Yes. The bus.

00:40:49.615 --> 00:40:51.345 line:93%
You can just take this bus. Come on.

00:40:52.485 --> 00:40:55.015 line:93%
(The bus just arrives, and they get on it together.)

00:40:55.015 --> 00:40:56.055 line:93%
Thank you.

00:40:56.414 --> 00:40:57.785 line:93%
(He helps Tae Hyun pay the fare.)

00:40:58.624 --> 00:40:59.684 line:93%
Are you a student?

00:40:59.985 --> 00:41:01.294 line:93%
- Sorry? - A student?

00:41:02.695 --> 00:41:05.095 line:93%
(He can't hide his joy.)

00:41:05.365 --> 00:41:06.425 line:93%
No, I'm not a student.

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:10.334 line:93%
I have three children.

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:11.604 line:93%
(I have 3 children.)

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:15.135 line:93%
You look so young.

00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:16.945 line:93%
Thank you.

00:41:18.474 --> 00:41:20.044 line:93%
- Is it Hotel Kazakhstan? - Yes.

00:41:20.814 --> 00:41:22.245 line:93%
This is my mission.

00:41:22.445 --> 00:41:24.015 line:93%
It's my mission.

00:41:24.015 --> 00:41:26.785 line:93%
What will be your prize if you win...

00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:27.954 line:93%
this competition?

00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:34.325 line:93%
(If I win?)

00:41:34.754 --> 00:41:37.365 line:93%
I get to sleep on a comfortable bed.

00:41:37.794 --> 00:41:40.595 line:93%
(Something like this)

00:41:41.495 --> 00:41:42.564 line:93%
If I don't win,

00:41:43.235 --> 00:41:45.535 line:93%
maybe I'll have to sleep out on the street.

00:41:47.135 --> 00:41:48.305 line:93%
(Really?)

00:41:48.735 --> 00:41:51.104 line:93%
If you don't, you have to sleep on the street?

00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:53.374 line:93%
(This is an amazing TV show.)

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.615 line:93%
(After a while on the bus)

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:59.385 line:93%
- Let's get off. - Here?

00:41:59.814 --> 00:42:00.885 line:93%
Thank you.

00:42:03.184 --> 00:42:05.985 line:93%
(He gets off the bus with the kind, young man.)

00:42:05.985 --> 00:42:07.524 line:93%
(They wait for the bus to transfer to.)

00:42:08.294 --> 00:42:09.655 line:93%
- This bus? - Yes.

00:42:09.655 --> 00:42:11.064 line:93%
- Bus number 19? - Yes.

00:42:11.724 --> 00:42:12.825 line:93%
Thank you.

00:42:12.825 --> 00:42:13.894 line:93%
(The bus arrives.)

00:42:13.894 --> 00:42:15.865 line:93%
(Tae Hyun gets on the bus.)

00:42:16.365 --> 00:42:19.035 line:93%
Could you let him know where to get off...

00:42:19.035 --> 00:42:21.334 line:93%
to go to Hotel Kazakhstan?

00:42:21.334 --> 00:42:22.474 line:93%
Okay.

00:42:22.474 --> 00:42:24.044 line:93%
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:42:25.774 --> 00:42:28.015 line:93%
I thought he was getting on the bus with me.

00:42:29.044 --> 00:42:30.515 line:93%
For your information,

00:42:31.445 --> 00:42:32.785 line:93%
I've lived abroad before.

00:42:32.785 --> 00:42:34.155 line:93%
I remember all the streets if I see them once.

00:42:35.454 --> 00:42:36.954 line:93%
First of all,

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:39.254 line:93%
I should check where Hotel Kazakhstan is.

00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:43.024 line:93%
It's very close to Abay Station.

00:42:43.024 --> 00:42:44.465 line:93%
It's amazing how close they are.

00:42:45.164 --> 00:42:48.334 line:93%
I'll go to Alatau Station by bus, take the subway,

00:42:48.564 --> 00:42:49.695 line:93%
and walk from Abay Station.

00:42:50.604 --> 00:42:51.765 line:93%
I'll sleep on bed for sure.

00:42:53.164 --> 00:42:55.175 line:93%
I have to get on the bus first.

00:42:55.175 --> 00:42:56.235 line:93%
(He needs to get on the bus first.)

00:42:57.044 --> 00:42:59.075 line:93%
(The bus arrives just in time.)

00:43:00.215 --> 00:43:03.615 line:93%
(His plan is going off without a hitch.)

00:43:04.745 --> 00:43:05.985 line:93%
Let's see.

00:43:06.785 --> 00:43:08.115 line:93%
Do you see the overpass over there?

00:43:08.454 --> 00:43:10.015 line:93%
There's usually a subway station near it.

00:43:11.785 --> 00:43:14.224 line:93%
Is it Hotel Kazakh?

00:43:16.354 --> 00:43:17.425 line:93%
I don't think it is.

00:43:17.425 --> 00:43:18.794 line:93%
(He's having a mental breakdown already.)

00:43:18.794 --> 00:43:20.124 line:93%
I think I got its name wrong.

00:43:22.265 --> 00:43:23.535 line:93%
I don't know where I am.

00:43:23.535 --> 00:43:24.564 line:93%
(Almaty, what an unfamiliar city.)

00:43:24.564 --> 00:43:25.604 line:93%
I'm in trouble.

00:43:26.905 --> 00:43:28.004 line:93%
Is there anyone...

00:43:28.535 --> 00:43:29.575 line:93%
who speaks English?

00:43:30.704 --> 00:43:31.845 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:43:31.845 --> 00:43:33.104 line:93%
(He asks someone for help.)

00:43:33.104 --> 00:43:34.814 line:93%
This is a hotel.

00:43:34.814 --> 00:43:35.974 line:93%
- A hotel? - Yes.

00:43:36.374 --> 00:43:38.414 line:93%
- Bus? - The bus stop over there.

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:41.485 line:93%
You can take a cab or bus number 128...

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:42.485 line:93%
(Take a cab or bus number 128.)

00:43:42.485 --> 00:43:43.985 line:93%
- or bus number 63. - 63?

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:45.825 line:93%
Thank you.

00:43:45.825 --> 00:43:47.195 line:93%
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

00:43:47.995 --> 00:43:50.965 line:93%
(He laughs after getting great information.)

00:43:52.164 --> 00:43:53.834 line:93%
(He's looking for the bus stop.)

00:43:54.894 --> 00:43:56.035 line:93%
That's the bus stop.

00:43:56.765 --> 00:43:57.805 line:93%
This is the one.

00:43:57.805 --> 00:44:00.274 line:93%
(Jong Min finally arrives at the bus stop.)

00:44:02.004 --> 00:44:03.945 line:93%
(He just needs to get on the bus now.)

00:44:04.805 --> 00:44:05.805 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:44:05.805 --> 00:44:07.675 line:93%
(Jong Min wants to double-check.)

00:44:07.675 --> 00:44:08.874 line:93%
Hotel Kazakh.

00:44:09.615 --> 00:44:11.385 line:93%
Do I get on the bus here?

00:44:11.385 --> 00:44:12.385 line:93%
Not here.

00:44:13.144 --> 00:44:14.715 line:93%
You should take the bus over there.

00:44:15.785 --> 00:44:17.454 line:93%
- Oh, over there? - Yes.

00:44:19.425 --> 00:44:23.325 line:93%
(His journey to cross the street begins.)

00:44:24.064 --> 00:44:25.595 line:93%
- The bus. - Yes.

00:44:25.995 --> 00:44:27.365 line:93%
It's across the street.

00:44:27.794 --> 00:44:29.434 line:93%
(She points at the opposite side.)

00:44:30.405 --> 00:44:33.635 line:93%
(He goes back the way he came.)

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:35.504 line:93%
(He has wasted a lot of time.)

00:44:36.104 --> 00:44:37.745 line:93%
(Will he be able to get on the bus?)

00:44:38.204 --> 00:44:41.175 line:93%
(Tae Hyun and Joon Young are doing great...)

00:44:41.175 --> 00:44:44.285 line:93%
(while Jong Min is still at the same place.)

00:44:45.584 --> 00:44:47.084 line:93%
(Tae Hyun successfully got on the second bus.)

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.655 line:93%
6th. It's the 6th stop.

00:44:48.885 --> 00:44:50.885 line:93%
He said it's the sixth stop. Oh, my.

00:44:52.754 --> 00:44:54.294 line:93%
(He's nervous now that he's alone.)

00:44:57.095 --> 00:44:59.224 line:93%
(He starts to miss someone.)

00:45:00.595 --> 00:45:03.504 line:93%
(He has to do everything by himself now.)

00:45:05.334 --> 00:45:06.365 line:93%
(Standing up)

00:45:08.004 --> 00:45:10.305 line:93%
(He's clearly anxious.)

00:45:11.044 --> 00:45:12.805 line:93%
What are you looking for?

00:45:12.905 --> 00:45:13.945 line:93%
Sorry?

00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:15.575 line:93%
What are you looking for?

00:45:16.144 --> 00:45:17.985 line:93%
(Tae Hyun is lucky today.)

00:45:18.644 --> 00:45:20.084 line:93%
(He's smiling again.)

00:45:20.715 --> 00:45:24.354 line:93%
I'm looking for this place. Here.

00:45:24.684 --> 00:45:26.754 line:93%
(The man looks carefully at the bill.)

00:45:27.454 --> 00:45:28.925 line:93%
- You have to... - Yes?

00:45:29.495 --> 00:45:31.394 line:93%
get off and go over there.

00:45:31.394 --> 00:45:33.124 line:93%
(You have to get off and go over there.)

00:45:33.834 --> 00:45:35.834 line:93%
(Seriously?)

00:45:37.164 --> 00:45:38.805 line:93%
(Get off and go a different way?)

00:45:38.805 --> 00:45:40.004 line:93%
Should I get off?

00:45:40.805 --> 00:45:42.434 line:93%
(My guardian angel told me the wrong way?)

00:45:43.274 --> 00:45:45.704 line:93%
- 1m? - 200m.

00:45:45.704 --> 00:45:47.274 line:93%
- 200m? - Yes.

00:45:47.774 --> 00:45:49.445 line:93%
Okay. Thank you.

00:45:49.445 --> 00:45:50.584 line:93%
(Tae Hyun gets off the bus in a hurry.)

00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:56.155 line:93%
(He's back to the beginning.)

00:45:56.655 --> 00:45:57.684 line:93%
Hold on.

00:45:58.925 --> 00:46:00.954 line:93%
I should ask someone again.

00:46:01.224 --> 00:46:02.294 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:46:02.425 --> 00:46:03.454 line:93%
Hi.

00:46:03.925 --> 00:46:05.265 line:93%
(Tae Hyun asks someone again.)

00:46:05.265 --> 00:46:07.834 line:93%
Is this Hotel Kazakhstan?

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:09.865 line:93%
(Kind students show him the way.)

00:46:10.965 --> 00:46:13.004 line:93%
(They point at the way the bus went.)

00:46:13.805 --> 00:46:15.274 line:93%
(Dumbfounded)

00:46:15.274 --> 00:46:16.305 line:93%
- This way? - Yes.

00:46:17.405 --> 00:46:19.374 line:93%
- You can walk there. - Okay. Thank you.

00:46:19.474 --> 00:46:20.515 line:93%
Thank you very much.

00:46:21.215 --> 00:46:23.684 line:93%
(It's 1.8km away, and he decides to walk.)

00:46:25.044 --> 00:46:26.044 line:93%
Gosh, that man.

00:46:27.115 --> 00:46:28.785 line:93%
(Why did he tell him to get off?)

00:46:30.885 --> 00:46:33.555 line:93%
(What the man saw was the statue.)

00:46:35.294 --> 00:46:40.995 line:93%
(He meant Republic Square, where the statue is.)

00:46:41.564 --> 00:46:42.595 line:93%
I'm doomed.

00:46:45.465 --> 00:46:47.334 line:93%
(He walks faster to shorten the time.)

00:46:47.334 --> 00:46:49.274 line:93%
Have you always followed me like this?

00:46:50.305 --> 00:46:52.704 line:93%
I follow you invisibly like the shadow.

00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:54.814 line:93%
You're not invisible.

00:46:54.814 --> 00:46:56.515 line:93%
I can easily see you.

00:46:57.084 --> 00:46:58.644 line:93%
Do the others have someone following them too?

00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:00.254 line:93%
That's ridiculous.

00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:01.885 line:93%
I should hurry.

00:47:02.715 --> 00:47:04.454 line:93%
I think Joon Young will get there fast.

00:47:06.055 --> 00:47:07.095 line:93%
(His plan is going well.)

00:47:07.095 --> 00:47:08.195 line:93%
I never miss my stop.

00:47:09.854 --> 00:47:10.995 line:93%
I should take the subway now.

00:47:12.064 --> 00:47:13.095 line:93%
I'm taking the subway.

00:47:14.934 --> 00:47:17.834 line:93%
I'm not sure how far Abay Station is.

00:47:19.564 --> 00:47:20.874 line:93%
Alatau.

00:47:20.874 --> 00:47:23.104 line:93%
1, 2, 3. It's 3 stations away from Abay Station.

00:47:23.845 --> 00:47:25.805 line:93%
Abay Station is only three stations away.

00:47:27.874 --> 00:47:29.914 line:93%
What if the subway doesn't come?

00:47:31.245 --> 00:47:34.515 line:93%
(Joon Young waits for the subway to come.)

00:47:35.115 --> 00:47:36.115 line:93%
Why isn't the subway here?

00:47:37.684 --> 00:47:38.954 line:93%
Four minutes have passed.

00:47:40.055 --> 00:47:41.425 line:93%
Five minutes have passed.

00:47:42.894 --> 00:47:45.765 line:93%
(He didn't expect to wait for this long.)

00:47:47.765 --> 00:47:49.834 line:93%
(Jong Min has been going back and forth.)

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.035 line:93%
What's that?

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.905 line:93%
(Something draws his attention.)

00:47:56.604 --> 00:47:57.945 line:93%
(He sees a bus in the distance.)

00:47:58.644 --> 00:47:59.874 line:93%
That's bus number 63!

00:48:00.274 --> 00:48:01.345 line:93%
It's bus number 63!

00:48:02.115 --> 00:48:03.374 line:93%
She told me to take bus number 63.

00:48:04.115 --> 00:48:05.385 line:93%
Darn it, that's the one.

00:48:06.414 --> 00:48:07.584 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:48:08.015 --> 00:48:09.055 line:93%
Hotel Kazakh.

00:48:09.814 --> 00:48:11.724 line:93%
Get off at Abay Station.

00:48:12.254 --> 00:48:13.285 line:93%
He told me to get off at Abay Station.

00:48:13.794 --> 00:48:14.825 line:93%
Abay Station.

00:48:15.294 --> 00:48:17.524 line:93%
I might win this race. Awesome.

00:48:18.164 --> 00:48:19.394 line:93%
Everyone will be surprised.

00:48:19.394 --> 00:48:20.394 line:93%
(He's on the right track now.)

00:48:21.135 --> 00:48:22.195 line:93%
I have a good feeling.

00:48:22.695 --> 00:48:24.004 line:93%
This is Abay Station.

00:48:24.004 --> 00:48:26.405 line:93%
Abay Station? Okay, thank you.

00:48:28.175 --> 00:48:29.934 line:93%
(He should get off at this stop.)

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.374 line:93%
What? That's Tae Hyun.

00:48:33.814 --> 00:48:35.575 line:93%
(Jong Min spots Tae Hyun.)

00:48:37.345 --> 00:48:38.445 line:93%
That's Tae Hyun.

00:48:38.445 --> 00:48:39.615 line:93%
(Anxious)

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:41.584 line:93%
Oh, my gosh.

00:48:42.055 --> 00:48:43.155 line:93%
(At the same time, Tae Hyun is...)

00:48:43.584 --> 00:48:45.155 line:93%
(running towards the hotel.)

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:46.184 line:93%
I found it.

00:48:47.155 --> 00:48:48.595 line:93%
(He must hurry.)

00:48:48.595 --> 00:48:49.655 line:93%
Tae Hyun is running.

00:48:50.164 --> 00:48:51.195 line:93%
The light won't change.

00:48:57.164 --> 00:48:59.004 line:93%
Thank you.

00:48:59.535 --> 00:49:00.675 line:93%
How did he get here?

00:49:00.805 --> 00:49:02.075 line:93%
He got here before me.

00:49:02.504 --> 00:49:03.544 line:93%
I have no time to waste.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:06.305 line:93%
I never thought I'd be wondering the streets...

00:49:06.305 --> 00:49:07.745 line:93%
of Kazakhstan by myself.

00:49:08.314 --> 00:49:09.314 line:93%
I have to catch up with him.

00:49:09.314 --> 00:49:10.515 line:93%
(He must catch up with Tae Hyun.)

00:49:13.184 --> 00:49:15.885 line:93%
There are so many birds here.

00:49:16.985 --> 00:49:18.684 line:93%
I see Tae Hyun over there.

00:49:20.894 --> 00:49:22.655 line:93%
I've almost caught up with him.

00:49:23.925 --> 00:49:24.965 line:93%
He's across the street.

00:49:29.334 --> 00:49:30.604 line:93%
(Taking the pose from "Titanic")

00:49:32.405 --> 00:49:34.434 line:93%
(I won!)

00:49:34.704 --> 00:49:35.704 line:93%
I'm in.

00:49:35.704 --> 00:49:36.874 line:93%
(He happily enters the hotel.)

00:49:40.345 --> 00:49:43.245 line:93%
What? "Come to Room 2511"?

00:49:43.245 --> 00:49:45.345 line:93%
(It's their final destination.)

00:49:46.485 --> 00:49:49.115 line:93%
(He can go straight to Room 2511.)

00:49:52.124 --> 00:49:53.155 line:93%
Hi. Excuse me.

00:49:53.454 --> 00:49:55.354 line:93%
Room 2511.

00:49:56.325 --> 00:49:57.995 line:93%
(I'm looking for Room 2511.)

00:49:58.425 --> 00:49:59.495 line:93%
Thank you.

00:49:59.495 --> 00:50:00.535 line:93%
(He checks with the staff first...)

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:03.965 line:93%
(and rushes to the elevator.)

00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:09.135 line:93%
Am I...

00:50:09.135 --> 00:50:11.144 line:93%
(What happened?)

00:50:13.175 --> 00:50:15.544 line:93%
(Right after Jong Min's arrival at the hotel)

00:50:16.015 --> 00:50:17.345 line:93%
I'm in.

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:20.885 line:93%
(Tae Hyun appears right after him.)

00:50:21.954 --> 00:50:25.354 line:93%
(While Jong Min was wasting...)

00:50:25.354 --> 00:50:28.825 line:93%
(his time at the front desk)

00:50:30.465 --> 00:50:31.564 line:93%
2511.

00:50:31.564 --> 00:50:33.195 line:93%
(Tae Hyun quickly walks into the hotel.)

00:50:33.495 --> 00:50:34.495 line:93%
2511?

00:50:34.535 --> 00:50:35.865 line:93%
(He checked the mission.)

00:50:37.064 --> 00:50:40.274 line:93%
(He directly walks to an elevator.)

00:50:42.235 --> 00:50:43.544 line:93%
(I'm the first to come!)

00:50:44.604 --> 00:50:47.345 line:93%
(He closes the door as soon as he gets on it.)

00:50:48.075 --> 00:50:49.075 line:93%
(Smiling)

00:50:54.354 --> 00:50:55.354 line:93%
- I came first. - What?

00:50:57.155 --> 00:50:59.684 line:93%
- I rode on it first. - What's going on?

00:50:59.684 --> 00:51:01.925 line:93%
- Why are you here? - I pressed the button.

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:03.095 line:93%
What's wrong with you?

00:51:03.254 --> 00:51:05.664 line:93%
- Hang on. - Why are you here?

00:51:06.224 --> 00:51:07.564 line:93%
This is so unfair.

00:51:07.635 --> 00:51:10.434 line:93%
- Hey! - I was the first to come.

00:51:10.865 --> 00:51:12.305 line:93%
(While arguing, the elevator stops.)

00:51:13.004 --> 00:51:14.334 line:93%
- Are we here? - Hang on.

00:51:14.334 --> 00:51:16.035 line:93%
I don't want to be the last to come.

00:51:16.434 --> 00:51:17.445 line:93%
Where is it?

00:51:17.805 --> 00:51:20.044 line:93%
(Who will open the door and win a victory?)

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:24.615 line:93%
(The door finally opens.)

00:51:26.345 --> 00:51:28.314 line:93%
(Tae Hyun is the final winner!)

00:51:29.354 --> 00:51:31.325 line:93%
(The victory is mine.)

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:36.794 line:93%
(The mission is over. What are they doing?)

00:51:36.794 --> 00:51:37.965 line:93%
Great job. Great job.

00:51:37.965 --> 00:51:39.425 line:93%
What is this?

00:51:40.495 --> 00:51:42.434 line:93%
Where is Joon Young? He should be around here.

00:51:43.135 --> 00:51:44.135 line:93%
(Is he here?)

00:51:46.265 --> 00:51:47.274 line:93%
(He closes the door.)

00:51:47.774 --> 00:51:48.974 line:93%
(He tries to lock the door.)

00:51:49.135 --> 00:51:51.004 line:93%
You can't lock the door anyway.

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.745 line:93%
- Is Joon Young not here? - He must be here.

00:51:52.974 --> 00:51:53.974 line:93%
He's there, isn't he?

00:51:53.974 --> 00:51:55.015 line:93%
(The curtain looks suspicious.)

00:51:55.945 --> 00:51:57.015 line:93%
(He opens the curtain.)

00:51:57.015 --> 00:51:58.684 line:93%
(There's nobody.)

00:51:59.485 --> 00:52:00.515 line:93%
(What?)

00:52:00.515 --> 00:52:01.885 line:93%
Did we arrive before him?

00:52:02.314 --> 00:52:04.124 line:93%
(This usually doesn't happen.)

00:52:04.624 --> 00:52:06.124 line:93%
Did we arrive before him?

00:52:06.124 --> 00:52:08.254 line:93%
Hello!

00:52:08.254 --> 00:52:10.624 line:93%
(I came before you.)

00:52:11.524 --> 00:52:13.934 line:93%
(The subway has finally arrived.)

00:52:15.035 --> 00:52:16.064 line:93%
Abay.

00:52:16.235 --> 00:52:17.334 line:93%
(He arrived at the destination.)

00:52:18.334 --> 00:52:21.004 line:93%
(He peacefully walked into the hotel.)

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.235 line:93%
Welcome.

00:52:23.235 --> 00:52:24.245 line:93%
(He was greeted by the staff.)

00:52:24.644 --> 00:52:25.644 line:93%
Room 2511?

00:52:27.745 --> 00:52:29.445 line:93%
(He was the first to complete the mission.)

00:52:29.445 --> 00:52:30.445 line:93%
It's hot.

00:52:31.885 --> 00:52:32.914 line:93%
I won.

00:52:32.914 --> 00:52:33.954 line:93%
(He's the best racer.)

00:52:34.385 --> 00:52:38.024 line:93%
(Joon Young's big picture brought him victory.)

00:52:38.524 --> 00:52:41.495 line:93%
According to the result of the mission,

00:52:41.524 --> 00:52:44.224 line:93%
Joon Young won and can sleep on the bed.

00:52:44.224 --> 00:52:46.325 line:93%
Tae Hyun in second place can sleep on the sofa.

00:52:46.325 --> 00:52:47.695 line:93%
Are you telling me to sleep here?

00:52:47.695 --> 00:52:48.695 line:93%
(Are you telling me to sleep here?)

00:52:48.995 --> 00:52:50.434 line:93%
In this hotel?

00:52:50.434 --> 00:52:51.965 line:93%
Are you telling us to sleep here?

00:52:52.704 --> 00:52:53.905 line:93%
- Seriously? - Jong Min will...

00:52:53.905 --> 00:52:54.905 line:93%
sleep outdoors.

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:56.575 line:93%
Outdoors where? Is there a place for it?

00:52:56.635 --> 00:52:58.575 line:93%
There are parks everywhere.

00:52:59.274 --> 00:53:00.914 line:93%
There are parks everywhere in Abay.

00:53:00.914 --> 00:53:01.914 line:93%
(I thought I'd win the 1st place this time.)

00:53:02.745 --> 00:53:05.044 line:93%
Tae Hyun, this is a model house, right?

00:53:05.044 --> 00:53:06.084 line:93%
Is this a model house?

00:53:06.115 --> 00:53:08.215 line:93%
It's not a model house. It's a model.

00:53:08.715 --> 00:53:09.854 line:93%
It's here. 5,000 tenge bill.

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:11.785 line:93%
You're right.

00:53:11.785 --> 00:53:12.985 line:93%
(It's the 5,000 tenge bill that put them in trouble.)

00:53:14.394 --> 00:53:15.825 line:93%
Hotel Kazakhstan is...

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:18.325 line:93%
built by a Korean Russian architect.

00:53:18.325 --> 00:53:19.794 line:93%
A Korean Russian architect?

00:53:19.794 --> 00:53:21.765 line:93%
It's the second highest building in Almaty.

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.735 line:93%
It's built in 1977 and...

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:26.235 line:93%
it's the oldest hotel in Kazakhstan.

00:53:26.434 --> 00:53:28.735 line:93%
As you see, it's on the 5,000 tenge bill.

00:53:28.874 --> 00:53:31.175 line:93%
It's one of the buildings that represent Kazakhstan.

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:33.715 line:93%
It's a really meaningful building.

00:53:33.715 --> 00:53:36.345 line:93%
- It makes me proud. - There are more places...

00:53:36.345 --> 00:53:38.684 line:93%
that are related to Korean Russians than we thought.

00:53:39.245 --> 00:53:40.854 line:93%
They left their trails a lot.

00:53:40.954 --> 00:53:44.684 line:93%
We must sleep here. It's built by Korean Russians.

00:53:44.684 --> 00:53:47.055 line:93%
- We will sleep here. - Yes. We must sleep here.

00:53:47.055 --> 00:53:48.254 line:93%
We shouldn't sleep outdoors.

00:53:48.254 --> 00:53:49.524 line:93%
I just realized...

00:53:49.524 --> 00:53:51.965 line:93%
why we decided who sleeps outdoors now.

00:53:52.425 --> 00:53:54.135 line:93%
It's because you should leave soon.

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.164 line:93%
To the mountain?

00:53:55.794 --> 00:53:58.604 line:93%
This is a meaningful place made by a Korean Russian.

00:53:58.604 --> 00:54:00.504 line:93%
There are a lot of places to sleep here.

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:03.334 line:93%
- No way. - You'll go somewhere...

00:54:03.405 --> 00:54:04.445 line:93%
you can see this hotel.

00:54:04.445 --> 00:54:05.604 line:93%
- Seriously? - Come on.

00:54:05.604 --> 00:54:08.144 line:93%
I told you I could see the mountains from here.

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:09.144 line:93%
(The mountain is silently calling Jong MIn.)

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:10.285 line:93%
(Kazakhstan)

00:54:12.544 --> 00:54:14.215 line:93%
(Cuba)

00:54:14.684 --> 00:54:15.684 line:93%
You're hungry, aren't you?

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.124 line:93%
- Yes. - Yes.

00:54:17.155 --> 00:54:18.184 line:93%
I'm so hungry.

00:54:18.684 --> 00:54:22.954 line:93%
From now on, we will play "Lunch Game".

00:54:23.024 --> 00:54:27.434 line:93%
We'll have a Korean Wave quiz with the fans.

00:54:27.434 --> 00:54:28.635 line:93%
Sounds good.

00:54:28.635 --> 00:54:31.405 line:93%
Defconn will be holding the quiz.

00:54:31.405 --> 00:54:34.905 line:93%
1 of the members and 3 fans will team up...

00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:36.305 line:93%
and answer the questions.

00:54:36.604 --> 00:54:38.144 line:93%
The one who wins the first place...

00:54:38.345 --> 00:54:41.814 line:93%
will have a nice lunch with the fans.

00:54:42.015 --> 00:54:44.684 line:93%
The rest will...

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:47.184 line:93%
skip lunch...

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:49.584 line:93%
and serve lunch to the fans.

00:54:49.584 --> 00:54:51.224 line:93%
- Only the winner eats? - Only the winner eats?

00:54:51.224 --> 00:54:55.294 line:93%
Yes. And those who win the first place in each...

00:54:55.394 --> 00:54:58.325 line:93%
category will receive a K-pop singer's signed CD.

00:54:58.325 --> 00:54:59.495 line:93%
(They are thrilled.)

00:55:01.635 --> 00:55:03.934 line:93%
Hello, fans in Cuba.

00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:06.434 line:93%
Let's say it out loud together. Cuba!

00:55:06.434 --> 00:55:08.235 line:93%
- Idol! - Idol!

00:55:08.235 --> 00:55:12.604 line:93%
I'm your host today. My name is Defconn. Hello.

00:55:12.604 --> 00:55:14.715 line:93%
(Nice to meet you, Defconn.)

00:55:14.715 --> 00:55:16.345 line:93%
First, I'd like to ask you a question.

00:55:16.345 --> 00:55:19.215 line:93%
With whom do you want to team up?

00:55:19.245 --> 00:55:20.754 line:93%
- Can we choose? - Well.

00:55:20.814 --> 00:55:22.785 line:93%
She picked Dong Gu.

00:55:22.954 --> 00:55:23.985 line:93%
Why?

00:55:23.985 --> 00:55:26.425 line:93%
I have been a big fan of his since he debuted.

00:55:26.425 --> 00:55:28.524 line:93%
She said she's a big fan of his.

00:55:28.595 --> 00:55:31.925 line:93%
Is there anyone who wants to team up with Yong Hwa?

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:34.334 line:93%
There are quite a few. What about you, Camilla?

00:55:34.595 --> 00:55:36.265 line:93%
- Who do you like? - Si Yoon.

00:55:36.265 --> 00:55:38.235 line:93%
And you, Vivian?

00:55:38.235 --> 00:55:39.334 line:93%
- Si Yoon. - She picked Si Yoon.

00:55:39.405 --> 00:55:40.434 line:93%
What about you, Christina?

00:55:40.874 --> 00:55:41.905 line:93%
Yong Hwa?

00:55:42.274 --> 00:55:43.544 line:93%
Does anyone want to be Joon Ho's team?

00:55:43.544 --> 00:55:45.405 line:93%
(We are looking for Joon Ho's fans.)

00:55:45.405 --> 00:55:47.274 line:93%
- Joon Ho? - Me!

00:55:47.274 --> 00:55:48.615 line:93%
- Me! - Joon Ho?

00:55:48.615 --> 00:55:50.785 line:93%
- Me! - Claudia raised her hand.

00:55:50.945 --> 00:55:52.485 line:93%
Why don't you try to attract them?

00:55:52.485 --> 00:55:54.814 line:93%
Convince them that you're a good teammate.

00:55:54.954 --> 00:55:58.724 line:93%
I love you. I love Claudia.

00:55:59.224 --> 00:56:00.524 line:93%
I love CUC.

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:02.925 line:93%
(I love CUC.)

00:56:02.925 --> 00:56:04.164 line:93%
(He looks for business partners.)

00:56:04.164 --> 00:56:05.695 line:93%
- CUC? - CUC.

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:08.265 line:93%
CUC is Cuban currency. So how do we make teams?

00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:11.405 line:93%
Each member will randomly pick your name.

00:56:11.405 --> 00:56:14.104 line:93%
Then please don't feel bad about the result.

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:15.135 line:93%
Okay.

00:56:15.135 --> 00:56:16.735 line:93%
(We won't hurt you.)

00:56:16.735 --> 00:56:18.345 line:93%
Smile.

00:56:18.504 --> 00:56:19.604 line:93%
- Smile. - All right.

00:56:19.604 --> 00:56:21.015 line:93%
Korea. Korea.

00:56:21.015 --> 00:56:22.245 line:93%
This is Korean casino.

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.644 line:93%
(He's alarmed.)

00:56:23.644 --> 00:56:24.785 line:93%
- Hurry up. - Smile.

00:56:24.785 --> 00:56:26.115 line:93%
I chose this one.

00:56:26.414 --> 00:56:27.914 line:93%
(Dong Gu and Yong Hwa draws the lots.)

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:30.325 line:93%
(Please)

00:56:31.925 --> 00:56:33.285 line:93%
You.

00:56:33.754 --> 00:56:35.224 line:93%
(The girls can't hide what they have in mind.)

00:56:35.224 --> 00:56:39.024 line:93%
Si Yoon, please call your team members' names.

00:56:39.024 --> 00:56:43.635 line:93%
Claudia, Nosren...

00:56:43.635 --> 00:56:44.965 line:93%
(They are my fans!)

00:56:44.965 --> 00:56:46.235 line:93%
Caren.

00:56:46.235 --> 00:56:48.004 line:93%
Oh, no! Claudia!

00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:49.535 line:93%
(They try to look sad.)

00:56:50.445 --> 00:56:53.245 line:93%
- Oh, my. - He lost his fans.

00:56:53.245 --> 00:56:55.015 line:93%
My gosh!

00:56:55.075 --> 00:56:56.845 line:93%
My teammates are Indra...

00:56:57.044 --> 00:56:58.314 line:93%
- Indra. - And...

00:56:58.314 --> 00:57:00.314 line:93%
- Congratulations. - Christina.

00:57:00.314 --> 00:57:02.515 line:93%
And Camilla.

00:57:02.515 --> 00:57:03.825 line:93%
Camilla.

00:57:03.825 --> 00:57:05.985 line:93%
Oh, my fan!

00:57:05.985 --> 00:57:06.995 line:93%
Poor them.

00:57:06.995 --> 00:57:10.095 line:93%
Smile. Smile. Smile.

00:57:10.524 --> 00:57:13.425 line:93%
Vivian looks quite disappointed.

00:57:13.995 --> 00:57:16.595 line:93%
Now we are going to play the game.

00:57:16.595 --> 00:57:18.334 line:93%
Let me tell you about the game rules first.

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:22.405 line:93%
I will read the question. If you know the answer,

00:57:22.535 --> 00:57:25.504 line:93%
you should come out and pick the microphone.

00:57:25.504 --> 00:57:26.704 line:93%
The team whose member gets the mic has the chance.

00:57:26.745 --> 00:57:28.675 line:93%
Only the fans can answer the questions.

00:57:28.715 --> 00:57:33.144 line:93%
The members can pick or hold the mic for the fans.

00:57:33.144 --> 00:57:35.515 line:93%
The first question is about a person.

00:57:35.515 --> 00:57:41.354 line:93%
You should guess who the person in the picture is.

00:57:41.495 --> 00:57:42.825 line:93%
Here goes the first question.

00:57:42.825 --> 00:57:44.024 line:93%
(The first question)

00:57:45.064 --> 00:57:46.394 line:93%
(Do you want to see the picture?)

00:57:48.095 --> 00:57:49.095 line:93%
Ready.

00:57:49.695 --> 00:57:50.704 line:93%
(Ready)

00:57:51.104 --> 00:57:52.235 line:93%
- Go! - I know the answer!

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:54.135 line:93%
(Answer is Song Joong Ki and Song Hye Kyo.)

00:57:55.035 --> 00:57:56.334 line:93%
(Jumping out)

00:57:57.044 --> 00:57:58.345 line:93%
(Unlike others he jumped to the mic.)

00:57:59.245 --> 00:58:00.914 line:93%
(He wins his teammates' heart...)

00:58:01.515 --> 00:58:03.345 line:93%
(and makes other fans dislike him.)

00:58:04.044 --> 00:58:05.644 line:93%
(This is how he becomes unlikable.)

00:58:06.515 --> 00:58:08.954 line:93%
Answer is Song Joong Ki and Song Hye Kyo.

00:58:09.215 --> 00:58:10.524 line:93%
Correct!

The day happens to be the market day is correct!

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.635 line:93%
Excuse me. Let me check Camilla's passport.

01:04:29.135 --> 01:04:30.305 line:93%
I think she's a Korean.

01:04:30.305 --> 01:04:32.265 line:93%
Camilla, what does it mean?

01:04:32.265 --> 01:04:34.334 line:93%
On the day you're supposed to do something,

01:04:34.334 --> 01:04:36.405 line:93%
you can't do it because something happened.

01:04:36.735 --> 01:04:39.144 line:93%
So the winner of the second round...

01:04:39.144 --> 01:04:41.474 line:93%
is Team Yong Hwa.

01:04:41.474 --> 01:04:42.774 line:93%

In 1, 2, 3. Defconn, we love you!

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:53.155 line:93%
Please give us a chance.

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.224 line:93%
(It seemed to have impressed Defconn anyway.)

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.354 line:93%
"Defconn, we love you"?

01:04:55.354 --> 01:04:56.995 line:93%
They will all receive the CDs.

01:04:56.995 --> 01:04:58.925 line:93%
Team Joon Ho should...

01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:01.095 line:93%
- do something. - I feel bad for them.

01:05:01.095 --> 01:05:04.004 line:93%
- You should get them CDs. - Gosh, I'm hungry.

01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:06.365 line:93%
- Right? - Camilla just said...

01:05:06.365 --> 01:05:07.774 line:93%
she's hungry.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:11.175 line:93%
You will all be able to eat. Don't worry.

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:12.575 line:93%
I will get no food.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.445 line:93%
Then it's all right.

01:05:14.445 --> 01:05:15.445 line:93%
Hey!

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:16.675 line:93%
(She's as selfish as Joon Ho.)

01:05:16.675 --> 01:05:18.044 line:93%
She looks happy again.

01:05:18.144 --> 01:05:19.814 line:93%
There are betrayers in my team.

01:05:19.814 --> 01:05:21.555 line:93%
- Goodness. - Let's move on.

01:05:22.655 --> 01:05:26.325 line:93%
The third round is about K-pop, which you love.

01:05:26.325 --> 01:05:28.754 line:93%
It's about K-pop.

01:05:28.754 --> 01:05:32.024 line:93%
We will play the intro of K-pop songs.

01:05:32.024 --> 01:05:33.394 line:93%
You will listen to the intro...

01:05:33.735 --> 01:05:37.204 line:93%
and guess the title and the artist of the song.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.664 line:93%
- Stand by. - Here goes the first one.

01:05:40.474 --> 01:05:41.974 line:93%

01:05:46.805 --> 01:05:49.845 line:93%
(After she took the microphone,)

01:05:49.974 --> 01:05:52.084 line:93%
(Defconn's groaning sound fills the room.)

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.985 line:93%
(Defconn is intimidated.)

01:05:53.985 --> 01:05:55.985 line:93%
- Nosren. - Hang on.

01:05:56.814 --> 01:05:58.925 line:93%
I need to wear a cast.

01:05:58.925 --> 01:06:00.854 line:93%
I'm scared. I'm scared.

01:06:00.854 --> 01:06:02.354 line:93%
I'm scared.

01:06:02.354 --> 01:06:03.425 line:93%
Goodness.

01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:05.425 line:93%
(They take a short break to fix the table.)

01:06:06.164 --> 01:06:08.695 line:93%
She's not just fast and furious.

01:06:08.794 --> 01:06:09.965 line:93%
She's double fast and furious.

01:06:10.235 --> 01:06:11.265 line:93%
(Embarrassed)

01:06:11.365 --> 01:06:13.004 line:93%

01:06:13.004 --> 01:06:14.434 line:93%
Twice's "TT".

01:06:15.774 --> 01:06:17.044 line:93%
(They do the cute dance moves in Cuba.)

01:06:17.044 --> 01:06:18.144 line:93%
(I'm sorry I broke the table.)

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:19.805 line:93%
You don't know How I feel

01:06:19.805 --> 01:06:21.575 line:93%
- You're mean - You're mean

01:06:21.814 --> 01:06:23.644 line:93%
Gosh, you're mean.

01:06:23.644 --> 01:06:26.015 line:93%
- Goodness. - That was so mean.

01:06:26.144 --> 01:06:27.314 line:93%
Here goes the next question.

01:06:27.954 --> 01:06:29.015 line:93%
(Dashing)

01:06:29.454 --> 01:06:30.524 line:93%
(It seems like she's the only one who knows it.)

01:06:30.524 --> 01:06:31.655 line:93%
All right.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:34.155 line:93%

01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:36.354 line:93%
- "This is LAPD!" - LAPD.

01:06:36.354 --> 01:06:38.224 line:93%
It's "Rookie" by Red Velvet.

01:06:38.825 --> 01:06:41.195 line:93%
(She can do the dance right away.)

01:06:41.695 --> 01:06:43.535 line:93%
(She's shy, but she shows everything she can do.)

01:06:45.365 --> 01:06:48.805 line:93%
It's Red Velvet's "Rookie". It was correct.

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:49.974 line:93%
It's "Rookie".

01:06:49.974 --> 01:06:52.675 line:93%
Camilla, do you know this song? "Rookie"?

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.814 line:93%
Then why didn't you come out?

01:06:54.115 --> 01:06:56.845 line:93%
My teammates are a little shy.

01:06:57.115 --> 01:06:58.184 line:93%
(They didn't know they were shy.)

01:06:58.184 --> 01:07:00.785 line:93%
- Please give us a chance. - All right.

01:07:00.785 --> 01:07:04.084 line:93%

Hang on. Don't say it.

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:22.434 line:93%
- My gosh! - Please wait.

01:07:22.434 --> 01:07:25.474 line:93%
This song is not an idol group's song.

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:26.845 line:93%
It's not.

01:07:26.845 --> 01:07:29.274 line:93%
But it's a song Koreans love.

01:07:29.274 --> 01:07:31.144 line:93%

01:08:02.015 --> 01:08:03.445 line:93%
(Music is universal.)

01:08:03.445 --> 01:08:04.684 line:93%
They all know the song.

01:08:04.684 --> 01:08:08.954 line:93%

The score is 1 to 1 to 1.

01:08:32.905 --> 01:08:34.144 line:93%
Here goes the last question.

01:08:35.014 --> 01:08:36.814 line:93%
- I'll get it. - They look aggressive.

01:08:36.844 --> 01:08:38.714 line:93%
- You can do it! - Let's fight.

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:41.755 line:93%

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:40.375 line:93%
- What happened? - Try it.

01:10:40.375 --> 01:10:42.735 line:93%
- No, thanks. - It's...

01:10:42.735 --> 01:10:44.144 line:93%
- Try it. - Camilla.

01:10:44.245 --> 01:10:46.844 line:93%
I don't want to. Why should I?

01:10:46.915 --> 01:10:48.814 line:93%
Try Yong Hwa's water.

01:10:48.814 --> 01:10:50.384 line:93%
- I'm scared. - Just a little.

01:10:50.384 --> 01:10:52.714 line:93%
- Why should I drink? - It's Yong Hwa's water.

01:10:52.945 --> 01:10:53.985 line:93%
(She spits it out.)

01:10:55.714 --> 01:10:57.024 line:93%
(He has a lot of nerve.)

01:10:57.684 --> 01:10:59.785 line:93%
- You're so mean. - What happened?

01:10:59.785 --> 01:11:01.255 line:93%
This is One Night Two Days.

01:11:01.695 --> 01:11:02.695 line:93%
There's salt in it.

01:11:02.695 --> 01:11:03.795 line:93%
(I got you.)

01:11:04.295 --> 01:11:05.365 line:93%
(He's so childish.)

01:11:05.365 --> 01:11:08.235 line:93%
When did you put salt in it? I didn't realize it.

01:11:08.795 --> 01:11:10.804 line:93%
I should put it before you realize it.

01:11:10.804 --> 01:11:12.235 line:93%
You were acting so natural.

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:16.474 line:93%
(From Cuba to Kazakhstan)

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:19.144 line:93%
Thanks to Jong Min, I can sleep at a nice place.

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:20.214 line:93%
Thank you, Jong Min.

01:11:21.274 --> 01:11:22.375 line:93%
You lost on purpose, right?

01:11:22.375 --> 01:11:23.474 line:93%
You didn't want us to catch a cold.

01:11:24.014 --> 01:11:25.314 line:93%
I already caught a cold.

01:11:26.985 --> 01:11:28.255 line:93%
It's open 24 hours.

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.655 line:93%
It's open 24 hours.

01:11:30.325 --> 01:11:31.455 line:93%
It looks nice.

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:33.384 line:93%
It's nice here.

01:11:33.894 --> 01:11:35.195 line:93%
I feel like eating pizza.

01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:39.195 line:93%
We're celebrating our 10th in a fancy restaurant.

01:11:39.464 --> 01:11:41.434 line:93%
Although you have to go to the mountain.

01:11:42.495 --> 01:11:43.905 line:93%
Isn't this too peaceful?

01:11:44.064 --> 01:11:45.134 line:93%
I know.

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:51.674 line:93%
(They stop worrying and enjoy their free time.)

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:53.445 line:93%
They seem to have Wi-Fi here.

01:11:53.445 --> 01:11:54.474 line:93%
(There is something out there.)

01:11:54.474 --> 01:11:55.545 line:93%
Noodles?

01:11:57.314 --> 01:11:59.445 line:93%
(It's the tent Jong Min will sleep in.)

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:02.384 line:93%
It's party time.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.684 line:93%
Congratulations on our 10th anniversary.

01:12:04.155 --> 01:12:05.985 line:93%
- Congratulations. - Great work, guys.

01:12:05.985 --> 01:12:07.625 line:93%
- We're in Kazakhstan. - I know.

01:12:07.795 --> 01:12:09.825 line:93%
- It smells good. - We did a great job.

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:11.995 line:93%
(Unlike indoors, they're busy outside.)

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:17.634 line:93%
(They didn't realize it at all.)

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.705 line:93%
Where will Jong Min sleep later?

01:12:21.835 --> 01:12:23.945 line:93%
There might be a bed on the corridor.

01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:25.674 line:93%
- Or in the living room. - The hotel must be seen.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.814 line:93%
You'll sleep outdoors where the hotel is seen.

01:12:28.814 --> 01:12:29.915 line:93%
But it's...

01:12:29.915 --> 01:12:31.915 line:93%
You can see the hotel from the subway too.

01:12:32.184 --> 01:12:33.785 line:93%
(What is that?)

01:12:33.785 --> 01:12:35.854 line:93%
To have it in sight, he should be farther away.

01:12:35.854 --> 01:12:36.884 line:93%
Look at that.

01:12:37.585 --> 01:12:40.295 line:93%
What are you setting up there?

01:12:40.655 --> 01:12:42.495 line:93%
(It's a great place to view the hotel.)

01:12:43.724 --> 01:12:45.964 line:93%
(They're happy since it's not their business.)

01:12:46.594 --> 01:12:47.865 line:93%
They're setting up the tent now.

01:12:48.295 --> 01:12:50.905 line:93%
Hey, this is a 24-hour-open place.

01:12:51.804 --> 01:12:53.134 line:93%
Then it'll be noisy here.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.104 line:93%
This is amazing.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.375 line:93%
It's open 24 hours here.

01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:57.875 line:93%
I won't be able to sleep.

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:00.575 line:93%
We set it up here for your safety.

01:13:00.644 --> 01:13:03.615 line:93%
- It will be safe here. - We'll come by later.

01:13:06.184 --> 01:13:07.285 line:93%
I think it'll be noisy here.

01:13:08.755 --> 01:13:09.955 line:93%
Gosh, I won't be able to sleep tonight.

01:13:09.955 --> 01:13:11.224 line:93%
(Will Jong Min be able to sleep well tonight?)

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:14.394 line:93%
We have to do the important thing.

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:15.524 line:93%
We need to do the important thing.

01:13:15.854 --> 01:13:17.325 line:93%
(Suddenly, a sketchbook shows up.)

01:13:17.325 --> 01:13:18.625 line:93%
What are you going to do?

01:13:18.625 --> 01:13:20.235 line:93%
Where is Zarina?

01:13:20.495 --> 01:13:21.594 line:93%
Zarina should write it.

01:13:21.594 --> 01:13:23.195 line:93%
Zarina should write it. Zarina, come sit here.

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:25.804 line:93%
(Zarina Muzaparova)

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.705 line:93%
"A Korean celebrity is sleeping here."

01:13:29.134 --> 01:13:30.205 line:93%
(Kim Jong Min, a Korean celebrity)

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:31.474 line:93%
What else should we write? Is that it?

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:33.974 line:93%
"A Korean celebrity is sleeping here."

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:36.115 line:93%
We should write one more thing. And...

01:13:36.514 --> 01:13:37.915 line:93%
(Staring)

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.485 line:93%
Right. "Please don't feed him."

01:13:40.514 --> 01:13:42.115 line:93%
(Please don't feed him.)

01:13:42.214 --> 01:13:43.585 line:93%
"Don't feed him."

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:44.585 line:93%
(Giggling)

01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:48.255 line:93%
"But you can talk to him 24 hours a day."

01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:49.724 line:93%
24 hours a day?

01:13:49.724 --> 01:13:51.125 line:93%
Add that I speak only one language.

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:52.365 line:93%
(He can talk anytime, but speaks only 1 language.)

01:13:52.524 --> 01:13:56.464 line:93%
Add, "Try calling him." "Jong Min."

01:13:58.505 --> 01:13:59.705 line:93%
Let's call him together.

01:14:00.104 --> 01:14:01.205 line:93%
Jong Min.

01:14:01.575 --> 01:14:02.634 line:93%
Goodness.

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:05.705 line:93%
(A Korean celebrity is sleeping here.)

01:14:05.705 --> 01:14:07.174 line:93%
They will call his name.

01:14:07.514 --> 01:14:08.774 line:93%
Jong Min!

01:14:09.274 --> 01:14:11.115 line:93%
(You can talk to him 24 hours a day.)

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:12.945 line:93%
(Try calling him. "Jong Min!")

01:14:13.554 --> 01:14:14.655 line:93%
I feel so proud.

01:14:15.354 --> 01:14:18.054 line:93%
I wish at least one person calls Jong Min.

01:14:18.524 --> 01:14:19.825 line:93%
Why don't you go to bed?

01:14:20.894 --> 01:14:22.394 line:93%
You're staying up late.

01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:24.995 line:93%
You said Kazakhs normally go to bed early.

01:14:24.995 --> 01:14:26.594 line:93%
There are not many...

01:14:26.594 --> 01:14:28.995 line:93%
24-hour-open cafes in Kazakhstan.

01:14:29.235 --> 01:14:31.865 line:93%
Kazakhstan is not for Jong Min.

01:14:36.844 --> 01:14:38.644 line:93%
(He gets ready to sleep and heads to the tent.)

01:14:38.644 --> 01:14:40.344 line:93%
I'll be thinking of the Korean Russians,

01:14:40.545 --> 01:14:41.575 line:93%
looking at the hotel.

01:14:41.575 --> 01:14:43.415 line:93%
(He's in the hotel in spirit.)

01:14:48.554 --> 01:14:49.755 line:93%
I want to get rid of it.

01:14:50.354 --> 01:14:51.354 line:93%
I need to sleep.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:53.184 line:93%
(It's fixed fast with tapes.)

01:14:53.894 --> 01:14:55.094 line:93%
It's too bright.

01:14:57.325 --> 01:14:59.394 line:93%
(Right then, a few people walk by the tent.)

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:02.835 line:93%
(What is this?)

01:15:06.804 --> 01:15:07.835 line:93%
What do they say?

01:15:07.835 --> 01:15:08.905 line:93%
They just smiled and walked away.

01:15:10.174 --> 01:15:13.205 line:93%
I hope Kazakh people think it's funny.

01:15:13.745 --> 01:15:15.115 line:93%
I hope they like it.

01:15:15.915 --> 01:15:17.115 line:93%
Good night.

01:15:17.115 --> 01:15:18.915 line:93%
Good night. See you tomorrow.

01:15:21.915 --> 01:15:23.155 line:93%
It's too bright.

01:15:26.684 --> 01:15:29.995 line:93%
(As soon as they went back to the hotel,)

01:15:29.995 --> 01:15:32.125 line:93%
(Tae Hyun and Joon Young fell asleep.)

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.634 line:93%
(It's so loud.)

01:15:39.005 --> 01:15:45.844 line:93%
(Jong Min spent the whole night with the lullaby.)

01:15:46.844 --> 01:15:48.545 line:93%
(It's right next to a 24-hour-open cafe.)

01:15:49.474 --> 01:15:51.045 line:93%
(It's a great location to view Hotel Kazakhstan.)

01:15:51.344 --> 01:15:53.085 line:93%
(This is a great place to sleep outdoors.)

01:15:53.085 --> 01:15:54.615 line:93%
Jong Min. Jong Min.

01:15:54.615 --> 01:15:55.785 line:93%
(He doesn't answer.)

01:15:56.354 --> 01:15:58.255 line:93%
(The staff tries to check Jong Min's status.)

01:15:59.825 --> 01:16:00.894 line:93%
Jong Min.

01:16:01.655 --> 01:16:02.854 line:93%
(Poking)

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.695 line:93%
(Surprised)

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.835 line:93%
(Where am I? Who am I?)

01:16:08.865 --> 01:16:10.304 line:93%
- Did you sleep well? - What?

01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:11.335 line:93%
Did you sleep well?

01:16:12.064 --> 01:16:13.104 line:93%
(I thought I was at home.)

01:16:13.104 --> 01:16:14.235 line:93%
Good morning.

01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:17.274 line:93%
Other members must have slept well.

01:16:17.274 --> 01:16:19.644 line:93%
I'll give you a chance to go wake them up.

01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:21.844 line:93%
(He's planning to moisten them.)

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.415 line:93%
Who do you want to wake up first?

01:16:24.884 --> 01:16:25.915 line:93%
Joon Young.

01:16:27.214 --> 01:16:29.085 line:93%
(It's so peaceful here.)

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.684 line:93%
(I'll break the peace.)

01:16:32.825 --> 01:16:34.424 line:93%
(They're deeply asleep, having no idea.)

01:16:36.094 --> 01:16:37.625 line:93%
(Did you sleep well?)

01:16:38.564 --> 01:16:40.434 line:93%
(Joon Young, I'm here.)

01:16:42.434 --> 01:16:44.104 line:93%
(Grinning)

01:16:44.564 --> 01:16:46.335 line:93%
(He looks scary.)

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:49.674 line:93%
(We're sorry we couldn't protect you.)

01:16:50.274 --> 01:16:52.075 line:93%
(He silently laughs.)

01:16:53.674 --> 01:16:55.075 line:93%
(Squirming)

01:16:55.915 --> 01:16:56.985 line:93%
(What is it?)

01:16:57.415 --> 01:16:59.085 line:93%
(Jong Min is cheerful in Kazakhstan as well.)

01:17:03.014 --> 01:17:04.224 line:93%
(Hilarious)

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:07.394 line:93%
(Goodness, I should not wake up my other prey.)

01:17:08.854 --> 01:17:10.295 line:93%
(What's this bad feeling?)

01:17:16.335 --> 01:17:18.165 line:93%
(He doesn't care. He sprays water at him.)

01:17:19.665 --> 01:17:20.974 line:93%
(His evil nature is revealed.)

01:17:20.974 --> 01:17:22.375 line:93%
Good morning.

01:17:24.104 --> 01:17:26.144 line:93%
(All the members of Team Kazakhstan is awake.)

01:17:27.045 --> 01:17:29.314 line:93%
I can't believe we're walking out of...

01:17:29.314 --> 01:17:30.814 line:93%
such a fancy hotel.

01:17:30.844 --> 01:17:31.985 line:93%
We should have breakfast.

01:17:32.045 --> 01:17:33.144 line:93%
Aren't we having breakfast?

01:17:34.354 --> 01:17:36.314 line:93%
Isn't breakfast included?

01:17:36.854 --> 01:17:38.224 line:93%
Let's go eat Korean food.

01:17:38.224 --> 01:17:39.354 line:93%
- Where are we going? - I want kimchi jjigae.

01:17:40.325 --> 01:17:42.995 line:93%
We looked around the downtown of Almaty.

01:17:43.255 --> 01:17:44.564 line:93%
Are we now leaving Almaty?

01:17:44.564 --> 01:17:47.064 line:93%
We're going to see the most beautiful scenery...

01:17:47.064 --> 01:17:48.134 line:93%
in Almaty.

01:17:48.195 --> 01:17:49.695 line:93%
So it means we're not leaving.

01:17:49.695 --> 01:17:50.804 line:93%
(What would be the beautiful scenery like?)

01:17:51.535 --> 01:17:53.264 line:93%
I must win "Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors".

01:17:53.674 --> 01:17:55.434 line:93%
Now I think of it, I lost both games.

01:17:55.434 --> 01:17:58.545 line:93%
I feel like tonight's game would be the worst.

01:17:58.545 --> 01:17:59.945 line:93%
We need to do something more difficult.

01:18:00.174 --> 01:18:01.644 line:93%
What if we play the game in the mountain?

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:03.915 line:93%
We never know.

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:05.814 line:93%
(The car heads to the outskirt of the city.)

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:06.985 line:93%
We're climbing up somewhere.

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:11.755 line:93%
Look at the pine trees and ice cap.

01:18:11.755 --> 01:18:13.554 line:93%
(The yellow trees and the ice cap look beautiful.)

01:18:13.554 --> 01:18:14.625 line:93%
It means it's really cold up there.

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:16.224 line:93%
Can cars climb up to the ice cap?

01:18:16.695 --> 01:18:17.995 line:93%
My ears are popping.

01:18:19.325 --> 01:18:21.464 line:93%
My eardrums are popping.

01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:23.564 line:93%
My eardrums are shaking like this.

01:18:23.564 --> 01:18:24.705 line:93%
(He's being a crybaby.)

01:18:24.705 --> 01:18:26.134 line:93%
We've just passed the point that is 1,550m...

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.535 line:93%
above sea level.

01:18:27.934 --> 01:18:29.104 line:93%
Really?

01:18:29.535 --> 01:18:30.905 line:93%
I have a breathing problem.

01:18:32.445 --> 01:18:33.474 line:93%
(He keeps whining.)

01:18:33.474 --> 01:18:35.144 line:93%
I need a respirator.

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.115 line:93%
This is an altitude sickness.

01:18:37.585 --> 01:18:39.085 line:93%
(At last, they arrived at the destination.)

01:18:40.655 --> 01:18:41.714 line:93%
Give me food.

01:18:41.985 --> 01:18:42.985 line:93%
Why do you not give us any food?

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:44.085 line:93%
I'm sorry. I just pushed you.

01:18:44.085 --> 01:18:45.184 line:93%
Give me food.

01:18:45.384 --> 01:18:47.625 line:93%
Why do you not give us breakfast?

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:49.854 line:93%
Up there, delicious food is waiting for you.

01:18:50.195 --> 01:18:51.464 line:93%
Then we should go.

01:18:51.464 --> 01:18:53.125 line:93%
- We should go there. - We're here for a reason.

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.165 line:93%
- We're... - We're simple.

01:18:55.165 --> 01:18:56.264 line:93%
(They're so simple.)

01:18:56.835 --> 01:18:58.604 line:93%
You said you're sick. You should stay here.

01:18:58.604 --> 01:19:00.835 line:93%
No, thanks. I will try to endure it.

01:19:01.774 --> 01:19:03.075 line:93%
(His gluttony makes him overcome the sickness.)

01:19:03.774 --> 01:19:05.945 line:93%
- Check out the altitude. - 3,500m?

01:19:05.945 --> 01:19:08.514 line:93%
- Are we climbing there? - We should climb there.

01:19:08.514 --> 01:19:11.745 line:93%
You're now on Shymbulak in Tian Shan mountains.

01:19:11.745 --> 01:19:14.585 line:93%
Here you can see the ice cap all year round.

01:19:14.615 --> 01:19:16.155 line:93%
The highest peak of Tian Shan mountains...

01:19:16.155 --> 01:19:18.755 line:93%
is about 7,400m above sea level.

01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:20.894 line:93%
We're going up to the point...

01:19:20.894 --> 01:19:23.155 line:93%
that is 3,200m above sea level on a cable car.

01:19:23.155 --> 01:19:24.195 line:93%
- Goodness. - 3,200m?

01:19:24.195 --> 01:19:26.995 line:93%
Yes, you will ride three cable cars to get there.

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:29.165 line:93%
- It's so far away. - We need to transfer?

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:30.564 line:93%
You can transfer from a cable car to another?

01:19:30.564 --> 01:19:33.335 line:93%
It's the second longest in the world.

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.235 line:93%
When you arrive at the top of Shymbulak,

01:19:35.235 --> 01:19:38.144 line:93%
your favorite thing, a hiking course awaits you.

01:19:38.144 --> 01:19:39.205 line:93%
- Hiking? - What?

01:19:39.205 --> 01:19:40.375 line:93%
A hiking course awaits you.

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:41.415 line:93%
- Hiking? - What?

01:19:41.415 --> 01:19:43.474 line:93%
(Seriously? Hiking?)

01:19:43.585 --> 01:19:44.714 line:93%
What are you talking about?

01:19:44.714 --> 01:19:47.485 line:93%
Not all of you must go hiking.

01:19:47.485 --> 01:19:48.585 line:93%
Only one of you will do it.

01:19:48.585 --> 01:19:49.814 line:93%
Why are you handing it to me?

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.485 line:93%
Put it away.

01:19:51.485 --> 01:19:54.354 line:93%
On the way there, you'll play a game...

01:19:54.354 --> 01:19:56.054 line:93%
to avoid hiking.

01:19:56.724 --> 01:19:58.564 line:93%
(Next week)

01:19:59.264 --> 01:20:01.035 line:93%

01:20:18.045 --> 01:20:20.314 line:93%
(They find our ancestors' trail in Kazakhstan.)

01:20:21.155 --> 01:20:23.115 line:93%

01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:24.785 line:93%
