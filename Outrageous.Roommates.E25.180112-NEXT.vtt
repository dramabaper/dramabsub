1
00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:09.184
(That night after the date at an amusement park)

2
00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.553
(The landlord sits down on the sofa as soon as he gets home.)

3
00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:14.264
Jung Won.

4
00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:18.233
Is she sleeping?

5
00:00:19.363 --> 00:00:21.334
(Jung Won is...)

6
00:00:22.503 --> 00:00:27.643
(writing something with all her heart that she can't even hear him.)

7
00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:30.413
(He's about to watch some movie.)

8
00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:33.114
(He didn't search for movies. He's looking up Jung Won.)

9
00:00:33.114 --> 00:00:34.313
(He's being serious.)

10
00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:37.184
(He's searching on Jung Won from the very past.)

11
00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:39.953
You can't do this to me even if you hate me.

12
00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:42.453
This can't be changed by someone.

13
00:00:44.053 --> 00:00:45.794
- Seung Soo. - Yes?

14
00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:46.864
What are you doing?

15
00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:50.764
I was searching for your past dramas.

16
00:00:51.694 --> 00:00:52.864
(Embarrassed)

17
00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:57.303
The amusement park was actually fun and unique.

18
00:00:57.303 --> 00:00:58.703
- It was fun, wasn't it? - Yes, it was.

19
00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:01.044
So what is your wish?

20
00:01:01.703 --> 00:01:03.173
(Seung Soo had to grant Jung Won's wish if she scored over 50 points.)

21
00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:05.313
If you can't score, I'll make a wish.

22
00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:06.643
- It's started. - Goodness. That can't happen.

23
00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:08.244
It was close!

24
00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:10.253
I'll make a wish.

25
00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:12.783
You do have a wish.

26
00:01:13.184 --> 00:01:14.354
- My wish? - Yes.

27
00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:15.453
I have a wish.

28
00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:17.794
You can't suddenly ask me to dance here.

29
00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:19.863
I hate those kinds.

30
00:01:20.324 --> 00:01:21.563
You can't dance?

31
00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:23.994
No, I mean, everyone can't just dance when asked to dance.

32
00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:25.233
But do you dance at all?

33
00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:28.363
I learned to dance a very long time ago because of my work.

34
00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:29.434
What kind of dance did you learn?

35
00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:31.733
My role was a club dancer.

36
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.143
My wish is that you dance like a clubber.

37
00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:36.214
- Yes, club dances! - No!

38
00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:37.313
What's wrong?

39
00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:38.874
- What's wrong? - Don't do this to me.

40
00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:40.343
What drama was it?

41
00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:41.943
It was "All In".

42
00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:43.184
- It was during "All In"? - Yes.

43
00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:46.624
(The drama "All In" was aired in 2003.)

44
00:01:47.154 --> 00:01:51.124
(Her role as a club dancer was shocking.)

45
00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:52.893
Tell me some other wish.

46
00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:54.863
My wish is to watch that scene.

47
00:01:55.164 --> 00:01:56.994
- Stop it. - Why?

48
00:01:56.994 --> 00:01:58.363
- Don't do that. - What's wrong?

49
00:01:58.363 --> 00:02:00.033
- "All In". - No, don't do it.

50
00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:02.003
- Don't do it. - Choi Jung Won in "All In".

51
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.134
- Seung Soo, stop it. - Club dances.

52
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.934
- What's wrong? - You don't have to watch it.

53
00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:08.404
Are you going to show me the dance if you won't let me watch it?

54
00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:09.973
- No. - What?

55
00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:13.214
Then truthfully...

56
00:02:13.343 --> 00:02:14.714
tell me.

57
00:02:14.883 --> 00:02:17.454
You have to make me move.

58
00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:20.524
Seung Soo, I'll just live here.

59
00:02:20.753 --> 00:02:22.554
(Seung Soo, I'll just live here.)

60
00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:24.723
(Taken aback)

61
00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:26.394
- Say it. - Hold on.

62
00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:28.464
But I can't guarantee it.

63
00:02:28.464 --> 00:02:29.763
I'm saying that...

64
00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:32.563
- it's my wish. - How can that be your wish?

65
00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:34.904
- You're mischievous. - But that's my wish!

66
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:37.503
You have to say this with all your heart.

67
00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:39.973
You have to say it like you mean it, so I can buy it.

68
00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:41.573
Say it with all your heart.

69
00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:45.073
I'll have to be in a mood then.

70
00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:49.043
You have to say it like you mean it,

71
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:50.313
so that I can fall for your words.

72
00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:52.614
Your wish is a very difficult one.

73
00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:54.684
That's exactly why it's my wish.

74
00:02:55.253 --> 00:02:56.954
- Are you going to be okay? - Of course!

75
00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:00.193
I'm totally fine. Say it whenever you're ready.

76
00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:01.263
Really?

77
00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:03.864
(Scene 1: "Moving-in Isn't Easy")

78
00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:05.994
- Seung Soo. - Yes?

79
00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:07.704
- Seung Soo. - Yes.

80
00:03:07.964 --> 00:03:11.133
I really want to live here.

81
00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:12.843
Can I live here, please?

82
00:03:13.103 --> 00:03:16.443
I don't think you mean it at all.

83
00:03:16.674 --> 00:03:19.984
I told you to move me, not annoy me.

84
00:03:20.144 --> 00:03:21.443
What I did was from the bottom of my heart.

85
00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:22.954
No, it wasn't.

86
00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:24.753
You didn't mean it at all.

87
00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:27.584
If you can't say it, I'll look for that clip.

88
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.853
Choi Jung Won's club Dance.

89
00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.024
(Hold on.)

90
00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:33.124
Seung Soo.

91
00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:34.663
It's because I'm nervous.

92
00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:39.133
I want to live here.

93
00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:41.063
I'm already used to this place.

94
00:03:41.063 --> 00:03:42.163
(He's laughing out loud.)

95
00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:45.404
You really need to control your mind now.

96
00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:47.543
This is my kitchen.

97
00:03:48.473 --> 00:03:50.744
I'll miss this place so much if I leave.

98
00:03:52.443 --> 00:03:54.144
I'll miss that clock as well.

99
00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:56.684
(He's searching for the dance clip.)

100
00:03:56.684 --> 00:03:58.084
How can you search for it while I'm acting?

101
00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:01.283
Okay. I got this.

102
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:02.424
I've found it!

103
00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:05.554
I can just stop you from watching it.

104
00:04:06.723 --> 00:04:09.494
- What's wrong? - I'll stop you from watching it.

105
00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:11.394
(You can't watch that clip.)

106
00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.033
This is fun.

107
00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.964
You're using force on me!

108
00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:17.273
Why is this taking so long to load?

109
00:04:17.503 --> 00:04:19.034
(Still loading)

110
00:04:19.443 --> 00:04:21.804
Decide if you want me to watch this or you are going to say that.

111
00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:23.374
I told you I was trying...

112
00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:24.744
- to concentrate. - Are you?

113
00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:26.044
- I'm trying. - Okay, I'll wait.

114
00:04:26.513 --> 00:04:28.844
(Actress Choi is trying to get the mood.)

115
00:04:28.844 --> 00:04:30.513
(He's feeling sorry.)

116
00:04:31.153 --> 00:04:34.953
The lighting is too bright. Let's dim it a bit.

117
00:04:35.953 --> 00:04:37.753
(Director Kim is controlling the light.)

118
00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:39.794
The lighting is too bright for me to say such things.

119
00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:41.594
I'll dim it a bit.

120
00:04:42.994 --> 00:04:44.094
How's this?

121
00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:45.294
(The living room got darker than before.)

122
00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.104
(The kitchen light is off too.)

123
00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:51.773
(Director Kim is ready.)

124
00:04:52.874 --> 00:04:55.273
(Actress Choi is set to act.)

125
00:04:56.844 --> 00:04:59.244
(Scene 2: "Moving-in Isn't Easy")

126
00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:01.643
(Jung Won is walking to Seung Soo.)

127
00:05:01.643 --> 00:05:05.054
(She's sitting next to him as if she has something to say.)

128
00:05:06.424 --> 00:05:07.523
Seung Soo.

129
00:05:07.624 --> 00:05:09.253
Yes? What is it?

130
00:05:09.253 --> 00:05:10.953
(Seung Soo looks at Jung Won while pretending to be clueless.)

131
00:05:13.023 --> 00:05:14.023
What is it?

132
00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:16.963
I don't know if I should tell you this.

133
00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:18.864
What is it? Just talk to me.

134
00:05:19.164 --> 00:05:20.604
It's really hard for me to say it.

135
00:05:21.234 --> 00:05:22.534
What is it? Are you uncomfortable?

136
00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:25.034
Gosh, I can't bring myself to tell you this.

137
00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:29.374
Come on. Just tell me what it is. Don't be nervous.

138
00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:31.744
I guess this is really a hard thing to do.

139
00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:34.044
Come on. What is this about?

140
00:05:35.744 --> 00:05:39.953
Honestly, I am really nervous.

141
00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:44.023
Despite my nervousness, it took me a lot of guts to tell you this.

142
00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:46.963
(Seung Soo looks at Jung Won with worry.)

143
00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:49.664
You're making me nervous. What is it? What is this about?

144
00:05:50.864 --> 00:05:51.934
I...

145
00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:53.403
Yes?

146
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:55.763
I...

147
00:05:57.703 --> 00:05:59.403
I want to continue living here.

148
00:05:59.403 --> 00:06:01.474
(I want to continue living here.)

149
00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:02.703
In my house?

150
00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:04.744
With me?

151
00:06:05.414 --> 00:06:09.213
Not necessarily. You don't have to live here.

152
00:06:10.813 --> 00:06:12.013
Without me?

153
00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:14.424
Seung Soo, think about it. Hold on.

154
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.724
Living with you wasn't part of your wish.

155
00:06:16.753 --> 00:06:19.924
There wasn't a line that I had to say I wanted to live with you.

156
00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:21.864
Aren't I right? Right?

157
00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:22.994
(They could make it happen since both are actors.)

158
00:06:23.294 --> 00:06:24.594
In my opinion,

159
00:06:24.594 --> 00:06:27.133
he wanted to know how it felt...

160
00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.604
to hear the line from a woman...

161
00:06:29.604 --> 00:06:32.374
he might meet in the future.

162
00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:33.773
It was like a practice.

163
00:06:34.573 --> 00:06:36.003
Never in my life...

164
00:06:36.003 --> 00:06:39.143
had I had a chance to hear such a line.

165
00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:41.013
So I was curious to find out...

166
00:06:41.013 --> 00:06:44.383
how I would feel if I heard something like that from a woman.

167
00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:46.684
That's why I asked her...

168
00:06:46.684 --> 00:06:50.294
to take my wish seriously and say the line like she meant it.

169
00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:53.624
Gosh, is living with me that hard? Is it?

170
00:06:53.624 --> 00:06:56.193
- It's not that. - Do you have to brace yourself...

171
00:06:56.193 --> 00:06:58.063
that much to say that? I got it.

172
00:06:58.063 --> 00:06:59.903
No, no, Seung Soo. When I act...

173
00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:01.263
Pay me the rest of your rent.

174
00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:05.034
(Jung Won only gave him a part of the rent on her first day.)

175
00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:08.073
(She will pay the rest depending on her satisfaction level.)

176
00:07:08.443 --> 00:07:09.974
Actually, I was going to give you the rest.

177
00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:11.273
- Give me my rent. - Seung Soo.

178
00:07:11.273 --> 00:07:13.583
- I'm going to raise the rent. - No, don't.

179
00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:15.883
- I'll double the rent. - Actually, I was going to...

180
00:07:16.114 --> 00:07:17.184
- Ta-da. - What?

181
00:07:17.614 --> 00:07:19.054
Is it the rest of the rent?

182
00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:21.484
As you know, this is an optional.

183
00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:23.994
But I think yesterday and today...

184
00:07:24.393 --> 00:07:26.193
- You deserve it. - Really?

185
00:07:26.193 --> 00:07:27.563
Yes. Don't take it if you don't want it.

186
00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:28.724
No, no, no.

187
00:07:28.724 --> 00:07:32.494
I really enjoyed spending yesterday and today with you too.

188
00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.934
But it looks like you're trying to use money to get rid of me.

189
00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:36.633
- No, Seung Soo. - It's been nice.

190
00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:38.203
This is a token of my gratitude.

191
00:07:38.203 --> 00:07:39.333
- Is it? - Yes.

192
00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:41.773
Okay. Did you enjoy your stay? Was it all right?

193
00:07:42.073 --> 00:07:43.643
I wrote about that on a separate letter.

194
00:07:43.643 --> 00:07:45.414
- You wrote a letter? - Yes.

195
00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:47.713
I was going to leave it in the room without your knowing.

196
00:07:47.883 --> 00:07:49.883
- But it seems like I couldn't. - Really?

197
00:07:50.354 --> 00:07:52.484
Read this when I'm gone, Seung Soo.

198
00:07:52.484 --> 00:07:55.224
- When you leave? - I ran out of room.

199
00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:57.153
I had a lot to write about.

200
00:07:57.153 --> 00:07:59.563
You had a lot you wanted to say to me?

201
00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:00.893
(Corners of his mouth lift.)

202
00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:03.364
- I'm looking forward to reading it. - Don't do that.

203
00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:05.763
- Here you go. - Thank you. Gosh.

204
00:08:05.763 --> 00:08:07.034
It was fun.

205
00:08:07.034 --> 00:08:08.633
- Thank you. - Sure.

206
00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:10.234
Gosh, I'm making money.

207
00:08:10.234 --> 00:08:12.034
I make a living with my properties.

208
00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:14.203
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

209
00:08:14.943 --> 00:08:17.773
Seung Soo, we forgot something today.

210
00:08:17.773 --> 00:08:19.013
We have to get our kimchi evaluated.

211
00:08:19.013 --> 00:08:20.744
Hold on. Let me bring my phone.

212
00:08:20.844 --> 00:08:23.414
(Seung Soo suggested making kimchi for winter as his condition.)

213
00:08:24.184 --> 00:08:26.424
(Jung Won suggested making a lot...)

214
00:08:26.924 --> 00:08:30.453
(to share the kimchi with their acquaintances.)

215
00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:34.594
(Chefs on a TV show complimented kimchi Seung Soo made.)

216
00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:36.564
To whom did you send it?

217
00:08:36.564 --> 00:08:37.564
To my sister.

218
00:08:37.564 --> 00:08:38.964
- To your sister? - Yes.

219
00:08:39.163 --> 00:08:40.663
(She's calling her sister, Jung Min.)

220
00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:43.303
I hope your sister likes salty food.

221
00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:44.503
Yes, Jung Won.

222
00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:46.374
- Jung Min. - Yes?

223
00:08:46.374 --> 00:08:48.803
Hey, it's me.

224
00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:50.314
I got your kimchi.

225
00:08:50.314 --> 00:08:52.074
Okay, okay.

226
00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:55.984
I have the landlord, Mr. Kim Seung Soo with me.

227
00:08:55.984 --> 00:08:57.413
Hello.

228
00:08:57.413 --> 00:08:59.484
- Hi. - Hey, there.

229
00:08:59.484 --> 00:09:01.954
So I heard you received the kimchi today?

230
00:09:01.954 --> 00:09:03.194
Yes, I did.

231
00:09:03.194 --> 00:09:05.793
- So have you tried it yet? - Not yet.

232
00:09:05.793 --> 00:09:07.194
- You haven't? - You haven't tried it yet?

233
00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:09.124
- I only smelled it. - Okay.

234
00:09:09.694 --> 00:09:11.763
I didn't want to eat it yet.

235
00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:13.403
Should I try it now?

236
00:09:13.403 --> 00:09:15.633
- Can you? Can you taste it now? - Right.

237
00:09:15.633 --> 00:09:17.734
Okay, but kimchi looks really white.

238
00:09:19.334 --> 00:09:21.474
(This is the kimchi they sent to Jung Min.)

239
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.913
(Feeling embarrassed)

240
00:09:24.074 --> 00:09:25.444
- Let me taste one. - Okay.

241
00:09:25.444 --> 00:09:26.683
(She'll evaluate after tasting it.)

242
00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:29.913
(Laughing)

243
00:09:30.383 --> 00:09:31.714
(She can only smile.)

244
00:09:32.283 --> 00:09:33.824
Thank you for it.

245
00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:38.494
You laugh like that when you eat delicious food, right?

246
00:09:38.893 --> 00:09:40.094
I think she does.

247
00:09:40.564 --> 00:09:42.494
It sounds like she loves our kimchi.

248
00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:45.234
I bet it's to her liking. Aren't I right?

249
00:09:46.334 --> 00:09:48.704
Jung Min, doesn't it make you laugh?

250
00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:50.374
- This thing... - Yes?

251
00:09:50.374 --> 00:09:52.503
"This thing".

252
00:09:52.503 --> 00:09:55.204
We should say this is pickled Napa cabbages.

253
00:09:56.043 --> 00:09:58.474
It's not that it's bad.

254
00:09:58.474 --> 00:10:00.214
We should stir-fry this.

255
00:10:00.814 --> 00:10:02.214
Does it need to be cooked?

256
00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:05.013
Yes. I think it'd be tastier if we cook it more...

257
00:10:05.013 --> 00:10:06.724
with other sauce.

258
00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:09.393
I see. I'd be glad if you can eat it somehow.

259
00:10:09.393 --> 00:10:11.553
Seung Soo is trying to make a business out of kimchi.

260
00:10:11.724 --> 00:10:14.824
Don't you think acting will be more profitable?

261
00:10:15.464 --> 00:10:17.663
I will focus on my career,

262
00:10:17.663 --> 00:10:19.364
but I'll run this as a side job.

263
00:10:19.364 --> 00:10:21.604
No, I think you were born to be an actor.

264
00:10:22.564 --> 00:10:23.974
Okay. Anyway...

265
00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:26.003
- Both of you... - Yes?

266
00:10:26.303 --> 00:10:28.903
- are actors. - Right.

267
00:10:28.903 --> 00:10:31.844
I personally think you two should continue on that road.

268
00:10:31.844 --> 00:10:34.783
- Jung Min. He made all the sauce. - Okay.

269
00:10:34.883 --> 00:10:36.383
But you're a horrible cook.

270
00:10:37.614 --> 00:10:38.854
Is she a horrible cook?

271
00:10:38.854 --> 00:10:41.383
No, I'm a good cook when I put my mind to it. What's wrong with you?

272
00:10:41.383 --> 00:10:43.253
Did you see how she moves her hands?

273
00:10:43.253 --> 00:10:44.893
Her fingers are thin and long.

274
00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:47.064
(When they were making kimchi,)

275
00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:49.864
(she was quite slow in mixing the stuffing with cabbages.)

276
00:10:50.633 --> 00:10:53.204
(But she did a thorough job.)

277
00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:54.834
I'll tell her to focus on acting.

278
00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:56.803
I should focus on my acting.

279
00:10:56.803 --> 00:10:58.474
- Okay. - Have fun living together.

280
00:10:58.474 --> 00:11:00.374
Okay, sure. Thank you.

281
00:11:00.374 --> 00:11:02.074
- Good luck. - Thanks.

282
00:11:02.074 --> 00:11:04.143
- Bye. - Bye.

283
00:11:05.913 --> 00:11:07.283
She only had one bite.

284
00:11:07.283 --> 00:11:09.913
She referred our kimchi as "thing".

285
00:11:10.214 --> 00:11:12.214
"This thing is..."

286
00:11:13.084 --> 00:11:14.753
My eyelids feel so heavy.

287
00:11:14.753 --> 00:11:17.854
Right, right. Both your body and mind...

288
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.624
- must have grown weak. - It was...

289
00:11:20.624 --> 00:11:22.734
It was really fun, Seung Soo.

290
00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:24.293
There's a price to pay for fun.

291
00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:26.964
Go inside, and sleep tight.

292
00:11:27.864 --> 00:11:30.574
(Seung Soo reads the letter Jung Won wrote in his room.)

293
00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:32.574
She wrote a lot.

294
00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:37.314
"We got to spend Christmas together,"

295
00:11:37.314 --> 00:11:39.714
"and because I spent it with you, this year's Christmas was special."

296
00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:41.484
"Thank you for your warm welcome..."

297
00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:43.614
"and helping me feel at home."

298
00:11:43.883 --> 00:11:47.653
"It was a comfortable stay, and I had a wonderful time here."

299
00:11:47.753 --> 00:11:51.653
"P.S. Seung Soo, don't take in too much salt!"

300
00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:55.724
(Her letter warms his heart.)

301
00:11:56.893 --> 00:11:59.964
(Jung Won is thinking about whether to choose "Yes" or "No".)

302
00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:04.704
(She paces back and forth in the room.)

303
00:12:04.704 --> 00:12:08.574
(She gives it a lot of thought for a long time.)

304
00:12:10.643 --> 00:12:12.714
(What is her decision?)

305
00:12:16.714 --> 00:12:18.214
My housemate, Choi Jung Won.

306
00:12:19.283 --> 00:12:21.383
Personally, I think that...

307
00:12:21.724 --> 00:12:24.954
I'm not an easy or simple person to live with.

308
00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:28.023
There were a lot of times that she was considerate of me.

309
00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:30.234
I'm very grateful for that.

310
00:12:30.234 --> 00:12:33.903
I already think that I'm going to...

311
00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:36.574
feel lonely when I'm alone now.

312
00:12:36.574 --> 00:12:39.173
I also feel that we have gotten close...

313
00:12:39.173 --> 00:12:41.874
to each other over a short period of time.

314
00:12:42.403 --> 00:12:44.574
(What is Seung Soo's decision?)

315
00:12:46.383 --> 00:12:49.783
(Their feelings are mutual, and their cohabitation is renewed.)

316
00:12:50.553 --> 00:12:52.214
(New housemates show up.)

317
00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:55.854
(I'll be the center of this show!)

318
00:12:57.224 --> 00:12:58.923
(Their popularity is monstrous.)

319
00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:00.124
(Center of the new sensation)

320
00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:03.133
(Wanna One, the most sought-after idol group)

321
00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:06.104
(They topped various music charts.)

322
00:13:06.734 --> 00:13:08.303
(Now, they are on My Unexpected Housemate.)

323
00:13:08.364 --> 00:13:10.533
- All I want to do, Wanna One. Hi. - All I want to do, Wanna One. Hi.

324
00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:12.003
I'm Kang Daniel of Wanna One.

325
00:13:12.003 --> 00:13:13.104
I'm Ong Seong Woo.

326
00:13:13.574 --> 00:13:14.903
I'm Kim Jae Hwan.

327
00:13:15.444 --> 00:13:17.673
Our accomplished dreams and support from our fans...

328
00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:19.074
make every day a happy day for us.

329
00:13:19.783 --> 00:13:22.244
However, just like people at our age,

330
00:13:22.244 --> 00:13:24.653
we want to have fun and go on trips too.

331
00:13:24.653 --> 00:13:27.224
So we are on our way to find our housemates...

332
00:13:27.224 --> 00:13:28.824
who will hang out with us!

333
00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:31.393
- Let's go! - Let's go!

334
00:13:31.954 --> 00:13:33.594
Gosh, it's the van.

335
00:13:34.594 --> 00:13:35.663
Okay.

336
00:13:35.663 --> 00:13:36.734
I have never been on this vehicle.

337
00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:37.893
- I... - Same here.

338
00:13:37.893 --> 00:13:39.163
saw this truck passing by.

339
00:13:39.163 --> 00:13:41.204
I saw this truck in front of herbal tonic clinics a lot.

340
00:13:42.104 --> 00:13:43.533
I knew it. Daniel is strong.

341
00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:44.803
Should we take this to the back seats?

342
00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:47.474
- Please help me. Help. - Hold on.

343
00:13:48.204 --> 00:13:50.244
(Daniel loads their luggage for them.)

344
00:13:51.543 --> 00:13:53.643
- Okay! - Okay!

345
00:13:53.643 --> 00:13:55.913
All right. To whose house are we going?

346
00:13:57.013 --> 00:13:58.484
- Hello. - Hi.

347
00:13:59.314 --> 00:14:00.624
- Hi. - Hey.

348
00:14:00.624 --> 00:14:01.984
- Thank you for the ride. - Thank you.

349
00:14:01.984 --> 00:14:03.694
- Hello. - Thank you for the ride.

350
00:14:03.724 --> 00:14:05.354
- We'll get going now. - Okay.

351
00:14:05.354 --> 00:14:07.194
(They set out.)

352
00:14:08.464 --> 00:14:10.033
I hope we'll find...

353
00:14:10.793 --> 00:14:12.393
great friends this year.

354
00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:14.903
I hope our master is kind. Our master?

355
00:14:15.364 --> 00:14:16.673
- "Our master"? - Wait. That came out wrong.

356
00:14:16.673 --> 00:14:18.204
- I hope we get... - Master.

357
00:14:18.204 --> 00:14:19.944
- Landlord. - a kind landlord.

358
00:14:19.944 --> 00:14:23.043
- Isn't that right? - We can be the landlord's pets.

359
00:14:23.043 --> 00:14:25.143
We'll be noisy, jump around, and mess up the house.

360
00:14:25.143 --> 00:14:27.043
"Master, I want to jump around."

361
00:14:27.043 --> 00:14:28.314
Great, great.

362
00:14:28.814 --> 00:14:30.354
I'll bark to be fed.

363
00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:31.783
I'd bark for food.

364
00:14:32.013 --> 00:14:33.783
I'll ask him to catch the bugs.

365
00:14:34.283 --> 00:14:36.824
- Where are we going, by the way? - I don't know.

366
00:14:36.824 --> 00:14:40.023
We don't even know whom we are meeting and where we are going.

367
00:14:40.194 --> 00:14:42.064
What if the landlord is scary?

368
00:14:42.094 --> 00:14:43.494
Like Ma Dong Seok?

369
00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:46.104
Or someone like Lee Gyeong Gyu.

370
00:14:46.864 --> 00:14:49.064
Gosh, I really enjoyed watching them.

371
00:14:49.064 --> 00:14:51.273
- I just had a wild thought. - What is it?

372
00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:52.773
What if it turns out to be our dormitory?

373
00:14:52.773 --> 00:14:54.043
No way.

374
00:14:54.273 --> 00:14:56.773
What if the rest of our members are waiting for us?

375
00:14:56.773 --> 00:14:58.374
Then I would sort of hate this show.

376
00:14:58.374 --> 00:15:00.413
I would hate My Unexpected Housemate.

377
00:15:00.783 --> 00:15:02.714
I'm really curious about the landlord.

378
00:15:03.214 --> 00:15:05.584
I bet the landlord is excited.

379
00:15:05.883 --> 00:15:07.124
I think he would be cleaning the house.

380
00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:09.224
I think he would be organizing things...

381
00:15:09.553 --> 00:15:10.624
and spraying the room.

382
00:15:11.824 --> 00:15:12.893
(Spraying the room)

383
00:15:13.864 --> 00:15:16.023
(Daniel predicted it precisely.)

384
00:15:16.893 --> 00:15:19.864
(The landlord who is spraying a room fragrance around his house...)

385
00:15:21.204 --> 00:15:23.773
(is comedian Yoon Jeong Soo.)

386
00:15:25.003 --> 00:15:27.474
I am Yoon Jeong Soo, and I've been a comedian for 27 years.

387
00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:30.444
People say this is my second heyday.

388
00:15:30.444 --> 00:15:34.214
But I am terrified of free days as I've been bankrupt before.

389
00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:37.854
Will I be able to find peace of mind...

390
00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.624
if I get a housemate?

391
00:15:39.854 --> 00:15:43.293
So today, I am getting a housemate.

392
00:15:44.753 --> 00:15:46.293
(The doorbell rings.)

393
00:15:48.694 --> 00:15:49.694
Who is it?

394
00:15:49.763 --> 00:15:50.864
(Is my housemate finally here?)

395
00:15:52.364 --> 00:15:53.763
Do you have a spare room?

396
00:15:53.763 --> 00:15:54.864
(Someone's voice comes from the outside.)

397
00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:56.974
It's a guy.

398
00:15:59.173 --> 00:16:00.374
Wait, please.

399
00:16:00.374 --> 00:16:01.444
(Jeong Soo is disappointed.)

400
00:16:02.474 --> 00:16:05.244
(He goes outside.)

401
00:16:06.214 --> 00:16:07.783
Do you know whose house this is?

402
00:16:07.783 --> 00:16:08.814
(The man waiting outside is...)

403
00:16:09.143 --> 00:16:10.814
I think I recognize your voice.

404
00:16:10.814 --> 00:16:11.883
(The equally disappointed tenant is Yook Joong Wan.)

405
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.683
I am the singer Yook Joong Wan...

406
00:16:13.683 --> 00:16:16.523
who used to live in a rooftop apartment with dirty pillows.

407
00:16:16.523 --> 00:16:17.653
I am going to get sick.

408
00:16:17.854 --> 00:16:20.824
I've been married for three years, and I've never been happier.

409
00:16:21.494 --> 00:16:24.393
But I want to be freed from my wife...

410
00:16:24.564 --> 00:16:26.704
even just for a day so that I can eat as much as I want...

411
00:16:26.704 --> 00:16:28.564
and spend as much as I want.

412
00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:30.403
So today,

413
00:16:30.474 --> 00:16:33.503
I will make a bold attempt to escape from home.

414
00:16:34.173 --> 00:16:35.374
He's someone I know.

415
00:16:35.374 --> 00:16:36.814
(He recognizes the landlord.)

416
00:16:37.173 --> 00:16:39.244
The voice sounds familiar.

417
00:16:40.114 --> 00:16:42.714
Should we say bye here?

418
00:16:43.114 --> 00:16:46.883
Who is it? I can't open the door. Hold on.

419
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.194
(The tenant doesn't want to go inside the house,)

420
00:16:50.194 --> 00:16:51.753
(and the landlord doesn't want to open the door.)

421
00:16:52.994 --> 00:16:54.893
(Finally, the door opens.)

422
00:16:55.293 --> 00:16:57.364
(Who is it?)

423
00:16:58.364 --> 00:16:59.734
I know who he is.

424
00:16:59.734 --> 00:17:00.803
(Just go back inside.)

425
00:17:00.903 --> 00:17:01.933
I know who he is.

426
00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:03.574
(The tenant refuses to enter.)

427
00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:05.274
What was that?

428
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.504
I am not that happy either.

429
00:17:07.504 --> 00:17:08.743
I was just joking.

430
00:17:08.804 --> 00:17:09.973
Am I older than you?

431
00:17:10.614 --> 00:17:11.673
Am I older?

432
00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:13.844
Who do you think I am?

433
00:17:14.443 --> 00:17:15.983
You sound like Yoon Jeong Soo.

434
00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:19.354
Do I know you?

435
00:17:19.354 --> 00:17:20.354
(The landlord doesn't recognize voices well.)

436
00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:21.923
Why don't you take a look?

437
00:17:21.923 --> 00:17:23.824
(He moves his hand.)

438
00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:26.324
(Jeong Soo sees him.)

439
00:17:27.294 --> 00:17:29.094
(He ends up looking away.)

440
00:17:29.764 --> 00:17:31.463
(He pays Joong Wan back.)

441
00:17:31.794 --> 00:17:33.433
Please open the door.

442
00:17:34.334 --> 00:17:36.233
- This is upsetting. - Jeong Soo.

443
00:17:36.403 --> 00:17:38.304
Stop it. This is not funny.

444
00:17:38.304 --> 00:17:40.304
My gosh.

445
00:17:40.403 --> 00:17:41.473
Don't do this to me.

446
00:17:41.574 --> 00:17:42.604
(He's annoyed.)

447
00:17:42.673 --> 00:17:43.973
Come in. Hurry up and come in.

448
00:17:43.973 --> 00:17:45.473
- Hello. - Welcome.

449
00:17:45.473 --> 00:17:47.643
Hurry up. Why did you bring so much?

450
00:17:47.643 --> 00:17:48.713
Come in.

451
00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:50.554
I came for a healing experience. So I packed a lot of things.

452
00:17:50.554 --> 00:17:52.614
Why would you want to leave home?

453
00:17:53.284 --> 00:17:54.453
You're unbelievable.

454
00:17:55.153 --> 00:17:56.653
My gosh.

455
00:17:56.893 --> 00:17:59.124
Come in first. Come in.

456
00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:01.064
It's nice to meet you.

457
00:18:01.064 --> 00:18:02.794
- Welcome. - Hello.

458
00:18:02.794 --> 00:18:04.864
Yook Bong Dal. What am I saying?

459
00:18:05.193 --> 00:18:07.304
- My name is Joong Wan. - Yes, Joong Wan.

460
00:18:07.304 --> 00:18:09.364
- Have a seat. - Yes.

461
00:18:09.364 --> 00:18:11.274
- Did you use this suitcase... - Yes?

462
00:18:11.274 --> 00:18:12.633
outside?

463
00:18:13.173 --> 00:18:14.504
I am sorry.

464
00:18:14.874 --> 00:18:16.413
When you get into my house, you need to tie your hair.

465
00:18:16.413 --> 00:18:17.614
Okay.

466
00:18:17.673 --> 00:18:20.413
My eyes are too good that I keep seeing hair.

467
00:18:20.413 --> 00:18:23.653
I can see the female crew member with long hair.

468
00:18:23.713 --> 00:18:25.213
If she leaves like that she's going to shed a lot.

469
00:18:25.213 --> 00:18:26.284
(He's very tidy.)

470
00:18:27.084 --> 00:18:28.923
I am very tidy, you see.

471
00:18:29.993 --> 00:18:31.094
I am very messy.

472
00:18:31.094 --> 00:18:32.923
- Thank you. - You should stop being messy.

473
00:18:32.923 --> 00:18:34.524
Lack of discipline got me here.

474
00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:37.163
(He makes a joke out of his experience.)

475
00:18:37.163 --> 00:18:38.834
- I will wipe it. - I am sorry.

476
00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:39.834
Wait.

477
00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:41.504
You don't have to wipe the floor.

478
00:18:41.504 --> 00:18:43.274
- Really? Okay. - Just the wheels.

479
00:18:45.504 --> 00:18:47.274
(They clean the suitcase.)

480
00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:51.374
I realized that it was going to be tough.

481
00:18:51.473 --> 00:18:54.183
He was too neat.

482
00:18:54.683 --> 00:18:57.483
I was worried that I would shed my hair.

483
00:18:57.754 --> 00:19:01.084
We don't mix well in that aspect.

484
00:19:01.824 --> 00:19:03.453
- This is amazing. - This is amazing.

485
00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:04.524
(They arrive.)

486
00:19:04.524 --> 00:19:06.024
I am so excited.

487
00:19:06.024 --> 00:19:09.433
My heart is beating, me likey

488
00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:10.963
Likey, likey, likey

489
00:19:11.034 --> 00:19:12.193
Pitter patter pitter patter Pitter patter

490
00:19:12.663 --> 00:19:14.834
(They dance to it too.)

491
00:19:15.433 --> 00:19:16.703
This is a nice place.

492
00:19:16.703 --> 00:19:18.034
It's like a celebrity's house.

493
00:19:18.504 --> 00:19:20.903
- We're here. - We're here.

494
00:19:21.104 --> 00:19:22.443
- We're here. - It's written here.

495
00:19:22.443 --> 00:19:23.913
"My Unexpected Housemate".

496
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.213
(They get off the elevator with much anticipation.)

497
00:19:26.383 --> 00:19:27.584
(The elevator door closes.)

498
00:19:28.983 --> 00:19:30.584
(He got left behind.)

499
00:19:32.153 --> 00:19:33.624
You came early.

500
00:19:33.953 --> 00:19:35.584
Why did you come so late?

501
00:19:36.024 --> 00:19:37.024
The traffic was bad.

502
00:19:37.024 --> 00:19:38.024
(They make a great team.)

503
00:19:38.024 --> 00:19:39.993
Should I press the bell? Should I?

504
00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.524
Should I? I will do it now.

505
00:19:43.693 --> 00:19:45.534
- I can't. - You already pressed it.

506
00:19:45.534 --> 00:19:47.034
- Did I press it? - You did.

507
00:19:47.203 --> 00:19:49.973
I want to rest for a day. Since I got married...

508
00:19:49.973 --> 00:19:51.034
(The doorbell rings.)

509
00:19:51.673 --> 00:19:52.743
(They're surprised.)

510
00:19:53.544 --> 00:19:54.804
Aren't you the only one?

511
00:19:56.544 --> 00:19:57.943
(Is there another person?)

512
00:19:59.713 --> 00:20:02.014
(They become very worried.)

513
00:20:03.514 --> 00:20:05.854
- I am hesitant to open the door. - Please wait.

514
00:20:07.354 --> 00:20:08.983
Please wait.

515
00:20:08.983 --> 00:20:11.354
Hello, sir.

516
00:20:11.354 --> 00:20:12.963
- Sir. - Sir.

517
00:20:13.564 --> 00:20:15.923
He sounds quite scary.

518
00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:17.364
Do you have a spare room?

519
00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:20.133
- It's a man. - is it a man again?

520
00:20:21.733 --> 00:20:23.574
(They are disappointed even before opening the door.)

521
00:20:24.774 --> 00:20:26.673
This show is a scam.

522
00:20:27.473 --> 00:20:29.243
They said they'd let me rest.

523
00:20:29.544 --> 00:20:30.874
Wait.

524
00:20:31.114 --> 00:20:32.844
- Okay. - Okay.

525
00:20:33.814 --> 00:20:35.114
He sounds hot-tempered.

526
00:20:35.383 --> 00:20:37.814
- He sounds scary. - He sounds hot-tempered.

527
00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:39.584
Let's go back down.

528
00:20:40.284 --> 00:20:41.354
Really?

529
00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:43.723
We should look for another room.

530
00:20:43.723 --> 00:20:44.824
(I want to do what I want.)

531
00:20:45.854 --> 00:20:47.624
Pretend this is your house, and open the door.

532
00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:50.334
Should I pretend I live here?

533
00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:52.903
Pretend this is your house.

534
00:20:52.903 --> 00:20:54.334
- I will... - Okay.

535
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.004
I will put on a mask.

536
00:20:59.774 --> 00:21:02.044
I will wear a mask.

537
00:21:03.514 --> 00:21:04.814
(It's a mask, not a bag.)

538
00:21:04.814 --> 00:21:06.014
Who is it?

539
00:21:06.844 --> 00:21:08.084
Who is it?

540
00:21:09.114 --> 00:21:11.183
We are Wanna One.

541
00:21:11.183 --> 00:21:13.324
What?

542
00:21:13.324 --> 00:21:15.883
- We are Wanna One. - We are Wanna One.

543
00:21:16.493 --> 00:21:18.453
Who?

544
00:21:19.124 --> 00:21:20.124
(He's very naughty.)

545
00:21:20.124 --> 00:21:21.564
Should we greet him formally?

546
00:21:21.564 --> 00:21:23.993
- We've come to rent a room. - 2, 3.

547
00:21:24.094 --> 00:21:25.264
- All I want to do is Wanna One. - All I want to do is Wanna One.

548
00:21:25.264 --> 00:21:26.804
- Hello, we are Wanna One. - Hello, we are Wanna One.

549
00:21:27.104 --> 00:21:28.534
- All I want to do is Wanna One. - All I want to do is Wanna One.

550
00:21:29.034 --> 00:21:30.233
(No way!)

551
00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:31.534
It's Wanna One.

552
00:21:33.173 --> 00:21:34.243
(What?)

553
00:21:34.473 --> 00:21:37.274
I think we should be serving them.

554
00:21:37.274 --> 00:21:39.374
Serve them?

555
00:21:39.483 --> 00:21:40.514
Let's see how many they are.

556
00:21:40.514 --> 00:21:41.514
(They run to the door.)

557
00:21:41.514 --> 00:21:43.183
Wait.

558
00:21:43.383 --> 00:21:45.254
(They rush to the door.)

559
00:21:45.254 --> 00:21:47.854
I wanted to meet them.

560
00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:49.653
But I don't think this is the way to meet.

561
00:21:49.653 --> 00:21:52.124
I wanted to meet them at a shoot and have a nice conversation.

562
00:21:52.124 --> 00:21:53.663
"Hello. I am Yoon Jeong Soo."

563
00:21:53.663 --> 00:21:56.064
"I've wanting to meet you."

564
00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:58.064
They came to my house.

565
00:21:59.433 --> 00:22:00.433
(The door opens.)

566
00:22:00.864 --> 00:22:02.163
Hello.

567
00:22:02.163 --> 00:22:03.274
Hello.

568
00:22:04.403 --> 00:22:05.574
- Hello. - Hello.

569
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:06.604
Hello.

570
00:22:06.604 --> 00:22:07.774
(It's a celebrity.)

571
00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.774
It's Wanna One.

572
00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:13.443
Hello.

573
00:22:13.743 --> 00:22:15.643
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

574
00:22:15.784 --> 00:22:17.153
Hello.

575
00:22:17.153 --> 00:22:18.913
- Hello. - Hello.

576
00:22:20.084 --> 00:22:22.423
(They are amazed.)

577
00:22:22.893 --> 00:22:24.594
- Excuse us. - Excuse us.

578
00:22:24.754 --> 00:22:26.663
Come in. It's nice to meet you.

579
00:22:26.663 --> 00:22:27.663
We met recently...

580
00:22:27.663 --> 00:22:30.133
- at an awards ceremony. - Hello.

581
00:22:30.963 --> 00:22:32.764
There's a view of the sea...

582
00:22:32.764 --> 00:22:34.163
I mean Han River.

583
00:22:34.163 --> 00:22:36.133
Yes. You've seen this house on TV, haven't you?

584
00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:37.173
I have.

585
00:22:38.203 --> 00:22:40.044
- I love it. - Do you like it?

586
00:22:40.643 --> 00:22:41.943
Will you...

587
00:22:43.074 --> 00:22:44.943
- bring your suitcases? - Yes.

588
00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:46.443
(Bags?)

589
00:22:46.483 --> 00:22:48.983
You're popular among girls,

590
00:22:48.983 --> 00:22:50.514
but you are just little brothers here.

591
00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:53.223
- Bring it one by one. - Okay.

592
00:22:54.284 --> 00:22:55.324
Whose suitcase is this?

593
00:22:55.453 --> 00:22:57.094
- This is mine. - It's Seong Woo's.

594
00:22:57.094 --> 00:22:58.524
Seong Hoon?

595
00:22:58.524 --> 00:23:00.493
- Seong Woo. - What's your last name?

596
00:23:00.493 --> 00:23:02.223
- It's Ong. - Ong Seong Woo. Yes.

597
00:23:02.223 --> 00:23:03.764
- Seong Woo. - Yes.

598
00:23:03.764 --> 00:23:04.993
- Put it sideways. - Okay.

599
00:23:06.534 --> 00:23:08.004
- We will help you clean. - Okay.

600
00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:09.163
Let them help.

601
00:23:09.163 --> 00:23:10.534
I have to check it first.

602
00:23:11.203 --> 00:23:13.104
(Even Wanna One can't be exempted.)

603
00:23:13.104 --> 00:23:14.673
- The house is so tidy. - Yes.

604
00:23:15.344 --> 00:23:17.574
- I am sorry to do this... - I am trying to grasp it.

605
00:23:17.574 --> 00:23:18.774
as soon as you came.

606
00:23:19.243 --> 00:23:21.344
(The cleaning began as soon as they met.)

607
00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:23.114
When we brought in the suitcase,

608
00:23:23.114 --> 00:23:25.614
he wiped the wheels.

609
00:23:26.014 --> 00:23:27.653
I think he's very neat.

610
00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:30.953
- You can see this in the morning. - You can see the river.

611
00:23:30.953 --> 00:23:32.493
It's amazing that he's got the view of the Han River.

612
00:23:33.794 --> 00:23:35.423
(Looking around)

613
00:23:36.163 --> 00:23:37.163
This is the game room.

614
00:23:37.794 --> 00:23:39.094
This is really a game room.

615
00:23:39.094 --> 00:23:40.864
(He has everything set up.)

616
00:23:42.104 --> 00:23:44.074
(He's very satisfied.)

617
00:23:44.074 --> 00:23:45.133
This is my dream.

618
00:23:46.643 --> 00:23:48.844
(The elder men are worried.)

619
00:23:50.574 --> 00:23:53.143
They are so popular that I can't treat them poorly.

620
00:23:54.383 --> 00:23:55.913
(He's frustrated.)

621
00:23:55.913 --> 00:23:56.913
This is amazing.

622
00:23:57.713 --> 00:23:58.784
I know.

623
00:23:58.784 --> 00:24:00.354
This view is even nicer.

624
00:24:00.754 --> 00:24:02.723
How does it feel to have the view of Han River?

625
00:24:03.524 --> 00:24:05.824
I just check if there's traffic or not.

626
00:24:05.824 --> 00:24:08.693
(It will be fun to watch them living in the same house.)

627
00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:11.364
- Let's go over the contract. - Yes.

628
00:24:11.364 --> 00:24:13.203
Have a seat. Here are my terms.

629
00:24:13.233 --> 00:24:15.764
If you have long hair, you must tie your hair.

630
00:24:16.274 --> 00:24:17.274
Long hair?

631
00:24:17.274 --> 00:24:18.733
- Because you can shed. - Yes.

632
00:24:18.774 --> 00:24:20.544
But nobody seems to have long hair.

633
00:24:20.544 --> 00:24:22.173
You have short hair.

634
00:24:22.243 --> 00:24:23.243
(His eyes are fixed at Joong Wan.)

635
00:24:23.243 --> 00:24:25.044
- We have short hair. - I...

636
00:24:25.473 --> 00:24:28.314
I'm slightly balding.

637
00:24:28.943 --> 00:24:30.913
So I lose a lot of hair.

638
00:24:31.814 --> 00:24:33.354
You should understand it.

639
00:24:33.354 --> 00:24:35.054
Of course. I understand.

640
00:24:35.054 --> 00:24:37.723
If you do that, I'll look like a strange man.

641
00:24:38.624 --> 00:24:40.893
I exist in my own world.

642
00:24:40.893 --> 00:24:42.993
You have to...

643
00:24:42.993 --> 00:24:44.294
get used to this.

644
00:24:44.294 --> 00:24:46.104
We have to understand each other.

645
00:24:46.104 --> 00:24:48.604
Don't do anything on your own in my house.

646
00:24:48.834 --> 00:24:51.903
You might break something while doing that.

647
00:24:52.004 --> 00:24:54.804
- Right. - Ask me to help you.

648
00:24:54.804 --> 00:24:56.713
- Let's go out. - Why?

649
00:24:56.713 --> 00:24:58.173
How can we live in a house like this?

650
00:24:58.443 --> 00:24:59.614
It's...

651
00:25:00.044 --> 00:25:01.213
How can we live in a place like this?

652
00:25:01.213 --> 00:25:02.544
It's a little uncomfortable.

653
00:25:03.054 --> 00:25:04.584
Don't do anything on your own.

654
00:25:04.584 --> 00:25:07.683
Jeong Soo. You're making Daniel uncomfortable.

655
00:25:08.683 --> 00:25:10.624
Edit it out, or I'll be in trouble.

656
00:25:12.963 --> 00:25:14.064
(It was a joke.)

657
00:25:14.963 --> 00:25:17.094
It hasn't been long since things started working out for me.

658
00:25:17.094 --> 00:25:19.403
- No. - Don't be like this.

659
00:25:20.403 --> 00:25:21.463
Scrub my back.

660
00:25:21.463 --> 00:25:23.903
- This one, I... - I...

661
00:25:23.903 --> 00:25:25.774
"Push my back."

662
00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:28.903
- It's not pushing. It's scrubbing. - "Pushing."

663
00:25:29.074 --> 00:25:30.243
Why would you push?

664
00:25:30.243 --> 00:25:31.243
(Pushing)

665
00:25:31.473 --> 00:25:34.743
My back's itchy sometimes, but my hand can't reach it.

666
00:25:34.743 --> 00:25:36.254
Of course, I could use a tool,

667
00:25:36.254 --> 00:25:38.054
but it's not satisfying.

668
00:25:38.183 --> 00:25:40.324
But if someone could scrub my back for me,

669
00:25:40.324 --> 00:25:42.183
it'll be so nice.

670
00:25:42.624 --> 00:25:45.754
It could be dirty,

671
00:25:45.993 --> 00:25:48.824
- but I'll get soaked. - "Soaked."

672
00:25:48.824 --> 00:25:50.094
Let's play the ladder for this.

673
00:25:50.094 --> 00:25:51.764
- Sure. - I want to do this.

674
00:25:51.764 --> 00:25:53.963
My condition is to leave the apartment...

675
00:25:54.264 --> 00:25:55.903
and enhance immune system.

676
00:25:56.004 --> 00:25:58.574
What do you mean by leaving the apartment?

677
00:25:58.633 --> 00:26:00.874
I want to go somewhere with fresh air...

678
00:26:01.104 --> 00:26:03.344
and spend a night there.

679
00:26:04.173 --> 00:26:06.413
- Like a pension. - Yangpyeong or Gapyeong.

680
00:26:06.413 --> 00:26:07.683
That's good.

681
00:26:07.683 --> 00:26:09.213
- It's good. Right? - Yes.

682
00:26:09.614 --> 00:26:12.084
- Somewhere like that. - Gapyeong is...

683
00:26:12.084 --> 00:26:13.153
Yes.

684
00:26:13.953 --> 00:26:17.453
You should go there with your girlfriend.

685
00:26:17.923 --> 00:26:19.193
(My goodness.)

686
00:26:19.393 --> 00:26:22.064
Why? What about it?

687
00:26:22.064 --> 00:26:23.564
- I... - How old are you?

688
00:26:23.663 --> 00:26:24.764
I'm 24.

689
00:26:24.764 --> 00:26:27.004
- You can talk about women. - Of course.

690
00:26:27.004 --> 00:26:28.334
- You? - I'm 23.

691
00:26:28.334 --> 00:26:29.433
- 23. - I'm also 23.

692
00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:31.374
- Then you can... - Of course.

693
00:26:31.374 --> 00:26:33.344
- talk about women. - We can talk about women.

694
00:26:33.344 --> 00:26:34.743
You can talk about your girlfriends.

695
00:26:34.743 --> 00:26:37.574
We can talk about women in the pension and have soju.

696
00:26:38.943 --> 00:26:41.183
- I don't drink. - You don't?

697
00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:42.854
- It's just you. - I love drinking.

698
00:26:42.854 --> 00:26:44.554
- You do? - I love it.

699
00:26:44.683 --> 00:26:45.754
We can drink.

700
00:26:45.883 --> 00:26:48.254
- I heard you love to drink. - Really?

701
00:26:48.983 --> 00:26:51.723
His peach... What's that called?

702
00:26:51.923 --> 00:26:54.223
- "Bongsugi". How can you say peach? - "Bongsugi".

703
00:26:55.264 --> 00:26:58.264
Boksungi. I mean, "Bongsugi".

704
00:26:58.264 --> 00:27:00.604
- That's also about drinking. - Tequila.

705
00:27:01.463 --> 00:27:02.663
It's about drinking tequila together.

706
00:27:02.933 --> 00:27:04.933
- Then now... - Let's look at your conditions.

707
00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:06.034
- Yes. - Yes.

708
00:27:06.403 --> 00:27:08.703
- We wrote one each. - Really?

709
00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:11.374
Seong Woo wrote, "I want to eat home cooking."

710
00:27:11.374 --> 00:27:13.183
Galbi is one of my favorite foods.

711
00:27:13.243 --> 00:27:14.844
- Galbi? - So I bought galbi.

712
00:27:15.514 --> 00:27:16.614
- Really? - I like it marinated.

713
00:27:16.614 --> 00:27:18.453
Each of us bought what we want to eat.

714
00:27:18.453 --> 00:27:21.483
- I bought kimchi fried rice. - I bought cheonggukjang.

715
00:27:21.483 --> 00:27:23.854
Unbelievable. Cheonggukjang?

716
00:27:24.294 --> 00:27:27.463
- I don't like cooking because... - Okay.

717
00:27:27.824 --> 00:27:29.693
I don't want the house to smell.

718
00:27:29.834 --> 00:27:32.594
I'll try my best to put up with them, but I'll be irritated.

719
00:27:33.203 --> 00:27:34.633
I'll be annoyed.

720
00:27:35.334 --> 00:27:38.604
- In Jeong Soo's house? - He likes cheonggukjang.

721
00:27:38.703 --> 00:27:41.143
Go eat it in Sinsa-dong. It's close.

722
00:27:41.143 --> 00:27:42.703
- They sell cheonggukjang there. - But...

723
00:27:42.703 --> 00:27:44.713
- he wants home cooking. - It will make the house smell nice.

724
00:27:45.243 --> 00:27:46.844
- What about galbi? - Let's eat cheonggukjang.

725
00:27:46.913 --> 00:27:49.114
- Let's eat cheonggukjang. - Is the galbi marinated?

726
00:27:49.314 --> 00:27:51.754
- Is galbi... - We have to grill it.

727
00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:53.223
It's raw.

728
00:27:53.423 --> 00:27:55.383
It'll emit smoke.

729
00:27:56.223 --> 00:27:59.254
Let's eat galbi too.

730
00:28:00.294 --> 00:28:01.463
It's nice to have you here.

731
00:28:01.463 --> 00:28:02.963
- You look happy. - I am happy.

732
00:28:03.163 --> 00:28:05.163
You look happy all of a sudden.

733
00:28:05.294 --> 00:28:07.633
I thought it was just going to be me and him.

734
00:28:07.703 --> 00:28:10.733
- Jae Hwan wants to run and play? - Yes.

735
00:28:11.834 --> 00:28:14.544
You're an adult. Why do you want to run around and play?

736
00:28:14.544 --> 00:28:16.943
I didn't have many opportunities to run around.

737
00:28:16.943 --> 00:28:18.314
Right.

738
00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:21.014
- We should go out. - Yes.

739
00:28:21.683 --> 00:28:24.413
Daniel said, "Catch the bug for me."

740
00:28:24.413 --> 00:28:25.754
Yes. I hate bugs.

741
00:28:26.084 --> 00:28:28.754
I fall in love with people who catch bugs.

742
00:28:28.754 --> 00:28:29.993
You fall in love with them?

743
00:28:30.024 --> 00:28:31.124
I really do.

744
00:28:31.324 --> 00:28:33.524
- I'm not afraid of bugs. - Me neither.

745
00:28:33.893 --> 00:28:35.364
- Don't worry. - I'll do it for you.

746
00:28:35.764 --> 00:28:36.864
Are there bugs in your house?

747
00:28:36.864 --> 00:28:39.034
- There's barely any. - Awesome.

748
00:28:39.034 --> 00:28:40.133
I'm the biggest bug here.

749
00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:43.604
Give it to the landlord.

750
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:45.574
- Thank you. - Here.

751
00:28:45.874 --> 00:28:47.703
- Thank you. - Thank you.

752
00:28:47.703 --> 00:28:48.844
Thank you.

753
00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:51.514
Don't take it out. Don't play tricks.

754
00:28:53.344 --> 00:28:54.883
You'll lose your hand.

755
00:28:56.213 --> 00:28:58.054
Don't play tricks, and hand it over now.

756
00:28:58.854 --> 00:29:02.423
This is nice. This is heavy.

757
00:29:02.423 --> 00:29:04.554
- Let's sign it. - Okay.

758
00:29:05.453 --> 00:29:07.723
- I... - Yes.

759
00:29:07.963 --> 00:29:10.133
went bankrupt after...

760
00:29:10.233 --> 00:29:11.733
- signing a bad contract. - Right.

761
00:29:11.893 --> 00:29:13.433
- So... - You need to be careful.

762
00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:15.834
You need to be careful. Whenever I make a contract...

763
00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:17.834
- I also seal between pages. - Pardon?

764
00:29:17.834 --> 00:29:20.473
- I stamp between pages. - Really?

765
00:29:21.604 --> 00:29:23.014
That's what you're supposed to do when you write a contract.

766
00:29:23.243 --> 00:29:24.874
- You're detailed. - Of course.

767
00:29:25.213 --> 00:29:26.814
- Goodness. - Here.

768
00:29:26.814 --> 00:29:28.614
(The landlord stamps first.)

769
00:29:28.614 --> 00:29:30.713
And here.

770
00:29:30.713 --> 00:29:31.983
I haven't seen a thumbprint in a long time.

771
00:29:32.183 --> 00:29:35.624
Then I'm going to stamp here.

772
00:29:35.624 --> 00:29:37.024
You know what to do exactly.

773
00:29:37.024 --> 00:29:38.754
Let's do it now.

774
00:29:39.223 --> 00:29:41.094
- You need to follow it. - Of course.

775
00:29:41.094 --> 00:29:42.794
- Take a stamp, - You'll be in trouble.

776
00:29:42.794 --> 00:29:44.733
- and here too. - Yes.

777
00:29:45.294 --> 00:29:47.403
I didn't know how many are coming,

778
00:29:47.403 --> 00:29:49.264
so I haven't assigned the rooms yet.

779
00:29:49.473 --> 00:29:51.903
Do you have five rooms?

780
00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:53.504
What?

781
00:29:54.604 --> 00:29:58.243
I should get my own room for the amount I paid.

782
00:29:58.243 --> 00:30:00.143
- I paid 200 dollars. - We each paid 200 dollars.

783
00:30:00.143 --> 00:30:02.514
- I paid 300 dollars. - Take it, and leave.

784
00:30:02.683 --> 00:30:05.153
- I paid 300 dollars. - Take it, and leave.

785
00:30:05.854 --> 00:30:08.723
Take it, and leave. I don't need it.

786
00:30:09.953 --> 00:30:11.423
- Then I'll take it, and leave. - Hey.

787
00:30:11.854 --> 00:30:14.624
- Then I'll take it, and leave. - Hey.

788
00:30:14.624 --> 00:30:17.393
- Let's leave. - Hey. I'm sorry. I lost my temper.

789
00:30:17.393 --> 00:30:18.534
We work together.

790
00:30:18.864 --> 00:30:21.264
- Shall we start with cheonggukjang? - Hold on.

791
00:30:22.774 --> 00:30:23.804
I got a text.

792
00:30:23.804 --> 00:30:25.274
- You got a text? - From the real estate agent.

793
00:30:26.173 --> 00:30:27.743
How did the contract go?

794
00:30:27.844 --> 00:30:30.913
Now you can enjoy cheonggukjang.

795
00:30:32.344 --> 00:30:33.883
- Let's make cheonggukjang. - Let's make cheonggukjang.

796
00:30:33.883 --> 00:30:35.014
Stop joking.

797
00:30:35.014 --> 00:30:37.483
We're not that close. Don't fool me.

798
00:30:38.713 --> 00:30:40.153
You did fool me for real.

799
00:30:40.153 --> 00:30:41.153
(You did fool me for real.)

800
00:30:41.584 --> 00:30:42.723
Gosh. You guys.

801
00:30:42.723 --> 00:30:44.223
(Crying)

802
00:30:44.524 --> 00:30:46.463
- Aren't you hot? - I'm fine.

803
00:30:46.723 --> 00:30:49.294
Take your clothes off. Why are you wearing so much inside the house?

804
00:30:49.294 --> 00:30:51.364
You can have soda if you want.

805
00:30:51.364 --> 00:30:52.393
- Really? - Of course.

806
00:30:52.393 --> 00:30:54.504
- I want coke. - Help yourselves.

807
00:30:57.173 --> 00:30:58.403
Help yourselves.

808
00:31:00.774 --> 00:31:02.703
- It's like... - It's all in order.

809
00:31:02.703 --> 00:31:04.514
- It's all in order. - you have a disorder.

810
00:31:04.514 --> 00:31:05.614
I can't believe it.

811
00:31:05.973 --> 00:31:07.683
- Yet... - It's amazing.

812
00:31:07.814 --> 00:31:09.014
You can have nurungji.

813
00:31:09.183 --> 00:31:10.754
- Amazing. - It's nurungji.

814
00:31:10.854 --> 00:31:12.653
- It's black rice. - Is this nurungji?

815
00:31:12.653 --> 00:31:13.723
It's so old-fashioned.

816
00:31:13.953 --> 00:31:17.453
We paid 1,000 dollars all together, and he's feeding us nurungji.

817
00:31:19.423 --> 00:31:21.124
I actually...

818
00:31:21.624 --> 00:31:25.034
There's always someone who ruins it.

819
00:31:26.163 --> 00:31:27.834
- It's good. - Amazing.

820
00:31:28.604 --> 00:31:29.973
It's making a mess.

821
00:31:29.973 --> 00:31:31.004
It's tasty.

822
00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:32.004
(Everyone's enjoying it.)

823
00:31:32.034 --> 00:31:33.874
What do we do now?

824
00:31:34.774 --> 00:31:36.344
- Change to something comfortable. - Right.

825
00:31:36.973 --> 00:31:38.074
- Do you want my clothes? - Goodness.

826
00:31:38.844 --> 00:31:40.483
(Daniel's startled.)

827
00:31:41.044 --> 00:31:42.614
(His eyes are shaking.)

828
00:31:42.784 --> 00:31:44.614
(He's walking on eggshells.)

829
00:31:45.854 --> 00:31:49.653
(Did you just drop food on my floor?)

830
00:31:51.693 --> 00:31:53.294
(He's in a rush.)

831
00:31:53.294 --> 00:31:57.534
It's fine. Drop as much as you want.

832
00:31:59.094 --> 00:32:01.364
- I'm sorry. - It's fine. Don't pick it up.

833
00:32:01.364 --> 00:32:02.874
Don't do that.

834
00:32:02.874 --> 00:32:04.804
What are you popular guys doing?

835
00:32:05.334 --> 00:32:07.403
- Come here. You paid a lot of rent. - Right.

836
00:32:07.403 --> 00:32:09.044
It's fine. You can spill.

837
00:32:09.044 --> 00:32:10.243
Go ahead, and spill.

838
00:32:10.243 --> 00:32:12.173
It's fine. Go ahead, and spill.

839
00:32:12.173 --> 00:32:15.383
Hey. You can spill. It's fine.

840
00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:16.814
It's all right.

841
00:32:17.054 --> 00:32:19.114
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.

842
00:32:19.284 --> 00:32:20.383
- I'm sorry. - Hey.

843
00:32:20.383 --> 00:32:22.183
You're probably careful everywhere you go.

844
00:32:22.183 --> 00:32:24.153
You should make yourselves home here.

845
00:32:24.794 --> 00:32:26.794
You need to do something about your hair.

846
00:32:27.963 --> 00:32:29.163
Let's clean up.

847
00:32:29.663 --> 00:32:30.764
I had no choice.

848
00:32:30.764 --> 00:32:32.903
I'm swayed by popularity.

849
00:32:33.933 --> 00:32:36.074
What do you want me to do?

850
00:32:36.074 --> 00:32:38.574
- They're hungry. - Right. We haven't eaten.

851
00:32:38.574 --> 00:32:39.903
- We're very hungry. - Sure.

852
00:32:39.903 --> 00:32:41.473
- Thank you. - Thank you.

853
00:32:41.574 --> 00:32:43.643
I never said I would cook for you.

854
00:32:44.413 --> 00:32:45.514
We should do it together.

855
00:32:45.814 --> 00:32:47.114
(He's spilling food again.)

856
00:32:48.114 --> 00:32:51.554
Kimchi fried rice, cheonggukjang and galbi.

857
00:32:51.554 --> 00:32:53.483
- Where's the food you brought? - Here.

858
00:32:53.883 --> 00:32:55.624
Those are ingredients for kimchi fried rice.

859
00:32:56.153 --> 00:32:57.294
- I see. - This is cheonggukjang.

860
00:32:57.953 --> 00:32:59.054
Awesome.

861
00:32:59.153 --> 00:33:00.493
This is galbi.

862
00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:01.963
There's skin too.

863
00:33:02.324 --> 00:33:04.794
People who want to rest, rest.

864
00:33:05.163 --> 00:33:07.903
People who want to help me, help me.

865
00:33:07.963 --> 00:33:10.034
I want to make kimchi fried rice.

866
00:33:10.034 --> 00:33:11.804
- You want to make it? - Yes.

867
00:33:12.203 --> 00:33:13.403
I'm confident in making it.

868
00:33:13.403 --> 00:33:14.703
Does anyone know how to make cheonggukjang?

869
00:33:15.473 --> 00:33:16.614
I know how to make cheonggukjang.

870
00:33:17.713 --> 00:33:18.874
I'll make cheonggukjang.

871
00:33:18.874 --> 00:33:20.443
- I'll grill the meat. - Okay then.

872
00:33:20.443 --> 00:33:22.183
I'll be an assistant.

873
00:33:22.413 --> 00:33:24.153
You can go rest.

874
00:33:24.153 --> 00:33:26.584
You want me to go rest? I need to watch.

875
00:33:26.683 --> 00:33:29.153
I'm afraid of what you're going to do.

876
00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:30.294
Watch us then.

877
00:33:30.294 --> 00:33:32.124
(They start with checking the refrigerator.)

878
00:33:32.124 --> 00:33:34.163
- There's whelk. - That looks delicious.

879
00:33:34.594 --> 00:33:36.493
(He's hosting an eating show alone.)

880
00:33:37.294 --> 00:33:39.064
That's mango. Do you want some?

881
00:33:39.064 --> 00:33:40.504
- Is it ice cream? - No.

882
00:33:40.504 --> 00:33:43.433
- It's frozen mango. - It's frozen.

883
00:33:43.433 --> 00:33:45.274
- Really? - Really?

884
00:33:45.804 --> 00:33:48.203
I'm sure we can eat anything we want.

885
00:33:48.203 --> 00:33:50.443
Of course. Eat just one.

886
00:33:50.844 --> 00:33:52.014
- Here. - "Just one."

887
00:33:52.713 --> 00:33:55.844
- You can take nurungji with you. - Okay.

888
00:33:56.383 --> 00:33:58.254
- There's a lot. - Take it with you.

889
00:33:58.254 --> 00:34:00.624
You're the men of the night.

890
00:34:02.483 --> 00:34:04.294
- Take it with you. - Thank you.

891
00:34:06.594 --> 00:34:08.593
- It's really tasty. - You mean nurungji?

892
00:34:08.593 --> 00:34:09.694
Yes.

893
00:34:10.263 --> 00:34:11.363
It's good.

894
00:34:12.834 --> 00:34:16.234
I should give this to them. I'm busy.

895
00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:18.274
- This is for you. - Thank you.

896
00:34:19.203 --> 00:34:21.604
You must cut it on the tray.

897
00:34:21.604 --> 00:34:22.703
- Yes. - Yes.

898
00:34:22.703 --> 00:34:24.714
(Seong Woo holds tissue underneath.)

899
00:34:25.714 --> 00:34:27.484
(Daniel licks off.)

900
00:34:27.484 --> 00:34:28.584
You're enjoying it.

901
00:34:29.113 --> 00:34:31.613
(Jae Hwan makes a sound as he eats.)

902
00:34:33.783 --> 00:34:35.024
This is really good.

903
00:34:36.553 --> 00:34:38.624
How big is the pot supposed to be?

904
00:34:38.723 --> 00:34:39.924
That's enough.

905
00:34:40.194 --> 00:34:42.564
- I might not have a lid. Hold on. - I don't need a lid.

906
00:34:42.564 --> 00:34:43.794
- You don't need it? - No.

907
00:34:43.794 --> 00:34:45.294
It'll stink even more without a lid.

908
00:34:45.964 --> 00:34:47.334
(Shocking)

909
00:34:48.134 --> 00:34:50.933
I have this. Let's use this one.

910
00:34:51.033 --> 00:34:52.303
Good. We're safe.

911
00:34:52.803 --> 00:34:54.604
This is all we have, and you want to use that one?

912
00:34:54.604 --> 00:34:55.774
This one has a lid.

913
00:34:56.714 --> 00:34:58.513
(This one has a lid.)

914
00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:00.113
- Let's use the one with the lid. - Okay.

915
00:35:00.113 --> 00:35:01.814
Don't let them know. It's embarrassing.

916
00:35:01.814 --> 00:35:03.714
Please don't tell them about this.

917
00:35:04.553 --> 00:35:07.823
(He starts making cheonggukjang with a pot with a lid.)

918
00:35:08.754 --> 00:35:12.993
(He puts in the cheonggukjang the boys brought.)

919
00:35:14.124 --> 00:35:16.634
(He also adds a heaping spoonful of doenjang to enrich the flavor.)

920
00:35:17.393 --> 00:35:21.404
(Now, he just needs to put in meat and tofu, then boil it.)

921
00:35:22.933 --> 00:35:24.834
(Right, I must close the lid today.)

922
00:35:25.203 --> 00:35:27.374
Oh, my. It smells very delicious.

923
00:35:27.843 --> 00:35:29.973
It actually feels like someone lives here now, don't you think?

924
00:35:30.243 --> 00:35:32.143
It feels like many people live here.

925
00:35:32.544 --> 00:35:34.183
The cheonggukjang smells amazing.

926
00:35:34.183 --> 00:35:35.884
- Doesn't it smell delicious? - It smells incredible.

927
00:35:36.413 --> 00:35:37.754
Oh, my. I can smell cheonggukjang.

928
00:35:38.113 --> 00:35:40.154
- The smell is... - Isn't it amazing?

929
00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:41.223
Yes. My gosh.

930
00:35:41.624 --> 00:35:43.754
(The smell is making me hungry again.)

931
00:35:45.424 --> 00:35:47.663
(He came to the room to resist the temptation.)

932
00:35:49.194 --> 00:35:51.593
(What?)

933
00:35:52.564 --> 00:35:54.234
(This guy has actually...)

934
00:35:55.163 --> 00:35:57.374
(been eating nonstop since arriving here.)

935
00:35:58.274 --> 00:36:00.703
(He even ate 3 of the frozen mango dessert.)

936
00:36:01.473 --> 00:36:03.314
(I'm still hungry.)

937
00:36:04.174 --> 00:36:07.044
(My gullet is always open for more food.)

938
00:36:08.013 --> 00:36:09.953
(And the ladies' hearts are open for him.)

939
00:36:10.953 --> 00:36:12.683
(I finished it.)

940

941
00:36:17.354 --> 00:36:19.794
(Mouth, open up. Here comes the fifth one.)

942
00:36:20.663 --> 00:36:23.393
(The frozen mango desserts are gone.)

943
00:36:24.964 --> 00:36:26.803
(Those in the kitchen are getting ready to grill meat.)

944
00:36:26.803 --> 00:36:27.834
Put it in now.

945
00:36:27.834 --> 00:36:29.163
Will we grill all of it at once?

946
00:36:29.163 --> 00:36:31.904
- Yes, we will. - Gosh, all of it?

947
00:36:31.904 --> 00:36:34.303
Hey, don't grill the whole thing at once.

948
00:36:34.303 --> 00:36:36.004
(That doesn't look right.)

949
00:36:36.004 --> 00:36:37.073
Divide it into two chunks.

950
00:36:37.073 --> 00:36:38.973
No, we can grill it at once.

951
00:36:38.973 --> 00:36:41.783
(The glutton comes out of the room as if nothing happened.)

952
00:36:42.183 --> 00:36:44.013
That sight must've been a shock to you guys.

953
00:36:44.913 --> 00:36:46.424
My family does the same thing.

954
00:36:46.424 --> 00:36:47.484
Seriously?

955
00:36:47.484 --> 00:36:48.754
(Nice, it was natural.)

956
00:36:49.024 --> 00:36:50.924
- We'll grill the meat. - The meat?

957
00:36:50.924 --> 00:36:52.624
- Yes. - Really? All right.

958
00:36:53.363 --> 00:36:54.564
(The boys take charge.)

959
00:36:54.564 --> 00:36:56.064
- I'll help you. - Thanks.

960
00:36:56.134 --> 00:36:58.993
(Seong Woo and Jae Hwan grill the meat quickly.)

961
00:37:00.464 --> 00:37:02.064
(If Jae Hwan cuts the meat,)

962
00:37:02.634 --> 00:37:04.274
(Seong Woo does the same.)

963
00:37:05.404 --> 00:37:07.604
(Their teamwork is impressive.)

964
00:37:08.444 --> 00:37:09.843
(I've seen this on TV.)

965
00:37:11.413 --> 00:37:15.084
Gosh, I can't believe that Wanna One is grilling meat at my place.

966
00:37:15.884 --> 00:37:18.053
- I think it's all cooked. - The pieces right there are cooked.

967
00:37:18.113 --> 00:37:19.754
The color tells me that they're cooked to perfection.

968
00:37:20.854 --> 00:37:22.283
My gosh, this is grilled perfectly.

969
00:37:22.924 --> 00:37:24.393
The ribs look good too.

970
00:37:24.393 --> 00:37:26.663
(They sure love to eat.)

971
00:37:26.964 --> 00:37:28.723
- I'm hungry. - I know, right?

972
00:37:28.863 --> 00:37:30.694
I'm really hungry. I'm starving.

973
00:37:32.464 --> 00:37:34.564
(Is it my turn now?)

974
00:37:35.604 --> 00:37:38.404
(Daniel's kimchi fried rice is the main dish of the day!)

975
00:37:39.473 --> 00:37:41.404
(He puts in all the veggies that he cut up.)

976
00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:43.374
Kimchi.

977
00:37:44.073 --> 00:37:45.544
(Seong Woo passes kimchi to him.)

978
00:37:45.544 --> 00:37:47.783
I should cut this on the cutting board and put it in right away.

979
00:37:48.384 --> 00:37:50.053
I should actually chop this.

980
00:37:50.053 --> 00:37:52.154
(Kimchi must be chopped, not sliced.)

981
00:37:53.683 --> 00:37:55.584
- Put kimchi in now. - Okay.

982
00:37:56.854 --> 00:37:58.524
- Jae Hwan, do this for me. - All right.

983
00:37:59.323 --> 00:38:00.393
(We didn't think he could do that.)

984
00:38:00.393 --> 00:38:01.564
My gosh, you did it.

985
00:38:02.464 --> 00:38:04.294
(Skillful)

986
00:38:04.393 --> 00:38:07.363
Gosh, nice. Look at you with the wok.

987
00:38:08.964 --> 00:38:11.573
(Smiling)

988
00:38:12.404 --> 00:38:13.904
You must've worked at a restaurant.

989
00:38:13.904 --> 00:38:15.444
(His skills made us curious about his past.)

990
00:38:15.874 --> 00:38:17.973
(Now, he just needs to put in ham and rice.)

991
00:38:17.973 --> 00:38:19.444
Oh, that. It's not coming out, right?

992
00:38:19.843 --> 00:38:22.444
(It doesn't look like the ham will come out of the can.)

993
00:38:23.484 --> 00:38:24.513
(Struggling)

994
00:38:24.513 --> 00:38:25.814
Give it to me. Let me try.

995
00:38:27.124 --> 00:38:28.984
(Jae Hwan's attempt fails too.)

996
00:38:30.654 --> 00:38:32.294
What are you guys doing? It's not coming out?

997
00:38:34.263 --> 00:38:35.393
Let me try.

998
00:38:36.093 --> 00:38:40.734
(Jeong Soo used to be known for his strength back in the days.)

999
00:38:41.964 --> 00:38:43.774
(The boys are watching.)

1000
00:38:44.104 --> 00:38:45.174
Let me try.

1001
00:38:45.904 --> 00:38:47.774
(But even Jeong Soo struggles.)

1002
00:38:47.774 --> 00:38:48.774
(Power up)

1003
00:38:49.073 --> 00:38:53.884
- Oh, it's working. It's coming out. - My gosh!

1004
00:38:53.884 --> 00:38:55.384
(I saw it! The ham really popped out of the can!)

1005
00:38:55.384 --> 00:38:58.384
Gosh, that made me so emotional.

1006
00:38:58.654 --> 00:39:00.384
I'm sure they were moved by it.

1007
00:39:01.754 --> 00:39:04.823
(This is what happens when guys hang out.)

1008
00:39:05.254 --> 00:39:07.794
By the way, I should call this "ham fried rice".

1009
00:39:08.924 --> 00:39:10.393
Putting in a lot of ham makes it tastier.

1010
00:39:10.393 --> 00:39:11.794
Gosh, hang on. This is too much.

1011
00:39:12.163 --> 00:39:13.634
Will it even fit in the frying pan?

1012
00:39:13.634 --> 00:39:15.703
That's a lot of rice. Just try putting in the whole thing.

1013
00:39:15.703 --> 00:39:16.834
(Rice)

1014
00:39:17.073 --> 00:39:19.234
- Exactly. - I think this is too big.

1015
00:39:21.374 --> 00:39:22.913
(He tastes the fried rice.)

1016
00:39:24.044 --> 00:39:26.243
How is it? It might be a bit bland.

1017
00:39:28.044 --> 00:39:30.384
- Yes, it's because of the kimchi. - I know.

1018
00:39:31.283 --> 00:39:33.424
Guys, the color needs to be appetizing.

1019
00:39:33.924 --> 00:39:35.384
Do you have sesame oil by any chance?

1020
00:39:35.384 --> 00:39:37.154
Of course. I have a ton of sesame oil.

1021
00:39:37.154 --> 00:39:38.154
Oh, nice.

1022
00:39:38.624 --> 00:39:40.393
(They put in a spoonful of sesame oil.)

1023
00:39:40.393 --> 00:39:41.694
Hey, shall we put in some gochujang?

1024
00:39:41.694 --> 00:39:42.694
Gochujang.

1025
00:39:43.393 --> 00:39:44.533
Squeeze it out.

1026
00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:46.703
Sesame oil made it taste better.

1027
00:39:46.933 --> 00:39:49.363
Olive oil. Put in more olive oil.

1028
00:39:50.033 --> 00:39:52.203
We have to make it delicious for Jeong Soo and Joong Wan.

1029
00:39:52.203 --> 00:39:54.274
We have to do our best to make sure this tastes good.

1030
00:39:54.944 --> 00:39:57.714
(Daniel's kimchi fried rice is starting to look delicious.)

1031
00:39:57.714 --> 00:39:59.413
- It's mouthwatering. - Oh, my gosh.

1032
00:39:59.714 --> 00:40:02.044
(Jae Hwan tastes it.)

1033
00:40:03.384 --> 00:40:05.484
(Daniel can't even look because he's nervous.)

1034
00:40:05.953 --> 00:40:07.854
- Try that too. - How is it?

1035
00:40:09.553 --> 00:40:11.024
- It's so good. - Is it good?

1036
00:40:11.024 --> 00:40:13.323
- It's really delicious. - Seriously?

1037
00:40:13.323 --> 00:40:14.363
Okay.

1038
00:40:15.624 --> 00:40:17.093
- We made this together. - Thanks.

1039
00:40:17.263 --> 00:40:19.033
- It's so good. - Nice!

1040
00:40:19.504 --> 00:40:21.363
(Daniel can finally smile again.)

1041
00:40:21.363 --> 00:40:23.533
Then shall we set the table now?

1042
00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:26.174
Gosh, I should bring out the bowls from England for you boys.

1043
00:40:26.174 --> 00:40:27.203
Bowls from England?

1044
00:40:27.203 --> 00:40:28.604
- That's probably it, right? - Yes.

1045
00:40:28.604 --> 00:40:31.044
(After bringing out the bowls one by one,)

1046
00:40:32.743 --> 00:40:34.584
(they're ready to eat.)

1047
00:40:34.613 --> 00:40:37.854
Guys, when the rice is ready,

1048
00:40:37.854 --> 00:40:40.323
an actress might show up.

1049
00:40:40.654 --> 00:40:42.993
So you guys should put out another empty bowl and spoon.

1050
00:40:43.794 --> 00:40:44.823
(It's false hope.)

1051
00:40:44.823 --> 00:40:47.663
We need to be ready at all times just in case.

1052
00:40:47.663 --> 00:40:49.064
You must still be disappointed.

1053
00:40:49.064 --> 00:40:50.993
Gosh, no. Not at all. I'm not disappointed.

1054
00:40:50.993 --> 00:40:53.234
I'll be exhausted if another guest shows up.

1055
00:40:53.604 --> 00:40:54.834
- Help me with this. - Okay.

1056
00:40:54.834 --> 00:40:56.203
(The absence of an actress has been forgotten about.)

1057
00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:57.604
- Okay. - Good.

1058
00:40:57.604 --> 00:40:59.274
Cheonggukjang should go here.

1059
00:40:59.274 --> 00:41:01.874
(They fill the table little by little.)

1060
00:41:02.504 --> 00:41:05.174
Jeong Soo, shall we eat together now?

1061
00:41:05.774 --> 00:41:08.183
- What a happy home. - This looks really good.

1062
00:41:08.183 --> 00:41:10.584
- I'm so happy right now. - Everything looks delicious.

1063
00:41:11.214 --> 00:41:12.584
It smells... Oh, my.

1064
00:41:13.624 --> 00:41:14.953
It even has meat.

1065
00:41:14.953 --> 00:41:16.794
- I crave this once in a while. - Me too.

1066
00:41:16.794 --> 00:41:17.924
This cheonggukjang has meat in it.

1067
00:41:17.924 --> 00:41:19.323
Just a little bit. That's enough.

1068
00:41:20.624 --> 00:41:23.093
Jeong Soo, the smell isn't too bad, right?

1069
00:41:23.734 --> 00:41:25.834
- You mixed it with doenjang, right? - Yes.

1070
00:41:26.303 --> 00:41:28.064
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

1071
00:41:28.064 --> 00:41:29.134
Enjoy.

1072
00:41:29.134 --> 00:41:30.874
(Jeong Soo starts eating first.)

1073
00:41:31.734 --> 00:41:33.404
(How is it?)

1074
00:41:33.843 --> 00:41:34.944
Try that first.

1075
00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:39.113
You're such a good cook. I'm really impressed.

1076
00:41:39.113 --> 00:41:40.283
No, no. Eat up.

1077
00:41:41.714 --> 00:41:43.183
It's because of the good ingredients.

1078
00:41:44.513 --> 00:41:47.283
It is really delicious. Can I be eating like this though?

1079
00:41:47.683 --> 00:41:49.723
I hope they don't ask me to eat things with them...

1080
00:41:49.723 --> 00:41:52.223
because I'm trying to lose some weight at the moment.

1081
00:41:52.223 --> 00:41:53.263
Don't you like to eat?

1082
00:41:53.263 --> 00:41:54.493
I do, of course.

1083
00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:57.734
Hey, the meat is really...

1084
00:41:59.933 --> 00:42:00.964
(Impressed)

1085
00:42:03.004 --> 00:42:04.573
- It's so good. - Yes!

1086
00:42:04.834 --> 00:42:07.044
(Everyone is impressed, and Joong Wan is proud.)

1087
00:42:07.573 --> 00:42:10.314
Well, we left a spot for one person.

1088
00:42:10.774 --> 00:42:11.774
What?

1089
00:42:11.814 --> 00:42:14.314
A female guest may join us later, you know.

1090
00:42:14.884 --> 00:42:16.553
- We should keep hoping. - Exactly.

1091
00:42:16.553 --> 00:42:17.584
All right.

1092
00:42:18.183 --> 00:42:19.584
(Daniel is busy eating.)

1093
00:42:19.584 --> 00:42:21.223
Seong Woo, this really is a home-cooked meal.

1094
00:42:21.783 --> 00:42:25.053
- This meets all the requirements. - This is how I like it.

1095
00:42:25.124 --> 00:42:27.323
- It did turn out well. - It's so good.

1096
00:42:27.393 --> 00:42:29.223
(The kimchi fried rice also suits everyone's taste.)

1097
00:42:29.694 --> 00:42:32.694
I divided the hamburg steak into six pieces, so bring your spoons here.

1098
00:42:32.694 --> 00:42:33.703
Okay.

1099
00:42:35.134 --> 00:42:36.433
I'll just use my hand.

1100
00:42:36.433 --> 00:42:38.504
It's so nice to eat with just guys.

1101
00:42:38.904 --> 00:42:41.774
It's really great! It's so much better than having a female guest.

1102
00:42:42.604 --> 00:42:43.973
Does everyone have a piece? Oh, six...

1103
00:42:43.973 --> 00:42:45.973
- All right, guys. - Yes.

1104
00:42:46.584 --> 00:42:49.214
I was a little nervous at the beginning because you guys...

1105
00:42:49.214 --> 00:42:50.854
- showed up out of the blue, - Right.

1106
00:42:50.854 --> 00:42:52.254
but I'm so happy to meet you all.

1107
00:42:52.254 --> 00:42:53.823
- Likewise. Thank you. - Thank you!

1108
00:42:53.823 --> 00:42:55.854
- Cheers! Be happy. - Cheers! Be happy.

1109
00:42:55.854 --> 00:42:57.354
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

1110
00:42:58.024 --> 00:43:01.064
(He eats the hamburg steak too.)

1111
00:43:01.393 --> 00:43:03.064
I think I'll put on about 2kg after this.

1112
00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:06.834
(Why do people want to lose weight?)

1113
00:43:07.964 --> 00:43:10.734
(He eats a piece of meat...)

1114
00:43:10.734 --> 00:43:11.774
(and takes a bite of the fried rice.)

1115
00:43:12.604 --> 00:43:14.874
(Everyone is quietly...)

1116
00:43:14.874 --> 00:43:17.643
(inhaling the food.)

1117
00:43:18.613 --> 00:43:20.984
(There's a sound that breaks the silence.)

1118
00:43:22.283 --> 00:43:23.814
(Licking)

1119
00:43:24.984 --> 00:43:27.223
Men don't talk to each other when they eat.

1120
00:43:27.953 --> 00:43:31.223
- Oh, no. - What happened?

1121
00:43:33.223 --> 00:43:35.363
(Seong Woo got cheonggukjang on his clothes.)

1122
00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:36.433
I spilled it.

1123
00:43:37.163 --> 00:43:38.533
(Jeong Soo looks for his wet wipes.)

1124
00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:39.564
You should've been careful.

1125
00:43:40.334 --> 00:43:41.604
What did you spill?

1126
00:43:41.734 --> 00:43:42.874
Cheonggukjang.

1127
00:43:43.703 --> 00:43:46.174
You spilled cheonggukjang? I guess it'll stink for a while.

1128
00:43:46.174 --> 00:43:47.604
(He wipes harder to get rid of the smell.)

1129
00:43:48.904 --> 00:43:50.243
Bring the odor eliminating spray.

1130
00:43:50.243 --> 00:43:52.674
(Jeong Soo uses the same wet tissue...)

1131
00:43:52.674 --> 00:43:54.544
(to wipe his mouth.)

1132
00:43:54.984 --> 00:43:56.984
Hey, did you... Did you spill it on your pants?

1133
00:43:56.984 --> 00:43:58.654
Stay away from your fans today.

1134
00:44:00.154 --> 00:44:01.384
They'll be disappointed in you.

1135
00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:03.893
"Gosh, he stinks!"

1136
00:44:03.893 --> 00:44:05.393
(It's cheonggukjang. Don't get the wrong idea.)

1137
00:44:05.393 --> 00:44:06.524
Your fans will...

1138
00:44:06.964 --> 00:44:08.763
- It's nice to eat together. - Totally.

1139
00:44:09.893 --> 00:44:11.194
I think we ate way too quickly.

1140
00:44:11.194 --> 00:44:12.904
- Yes. Gosh, I ate too fast. - Aren't you guys dizzy?

1141
00:44:12.904 --> 00:44:15.004
Yes. I'm really dizzy right now.

1142
00:44:15.004 --> 00:44:17.274
This is what guys do. We eat quickly and get all dizzy.

1143
00:44:17.274 --> 00:44:19.774
- That's right. - After eating, every man should...

1144
00:44:19.774 --> 00:44:21.674
- Will you lie down right away? - Right now...

1145
00:44:21.743 --> 00:44:23.944
- I'll rest like this for a bit. - The world of men.

1146
00:44:23.944 --> 00:44:25.174
Welcome to the world of men.

1147
00:44:26.013 --> 00:44:28.143
- He's leaning on that thing too. - Yes, I am.

1148
00:44:28.214 --> 00:44:30.413
I'm pretending I'm not leaning, but I am indeed leaning back on this.

1149
00:44:30.953 --> 00:44:32.553
Gosh, I'm so comfortable now.

1150
00:44:32.553 --> 00:44:33.984
(They're experiencing the world of men.)

1151
00:44:34.783 --> 00:44:36.893
Are we going to go out, Jeong Soo?

1152
00:44:36.893 --> 00:44:37.893
We should.

1153
00:44:37.893 --> 00:44:39.663
Then give me my rent back.

1154
00:44:39.663 --> 00:44:40.663
Why should I?

1155
00:44:41.124 --> 00:44:42.124
I told you I'm moving out.

1156
00:44:42.124 --> 00:44:44.163
- What are you talking about? - I told you.

1157
00:44:44.163 --> 00:44:45.564
Just sleep here, then.

1158
00:44:45.564 --> 00:44:46.763
(What a fun sight.)

1159
00:44:46.763 --> 00:44:49.973
Hey. Once you give me money, it can never be returned.

1160
00:44:50.874 --> 00:44:52.504
I've already spent all of it.

1161
00:44:52.504 --> 00:44:55.444
Since the new year has just begun,

1162
00:44:55.444 --> 00:44:56.743
- Right, it's the new year. - we'll bow...

1163
00:44:56.743 --> 00:44:59.274
That's it. We should bow to him. Hey, it's perfect.

1164
00:44:59.274 --> 00:45:01.714
- Let's bow to Jeong Soo. - What's this nonsense? Don't.

1165
00:45:01.714 --> 00:45:04.084
- Let's do it. - No, no. I won't accept it.

1166
00:45:04.084 --> 00:45:05.183
- I said I don't want it. - Let's do it here.

1167
00:45:05.183 --> 00:45:06.254
Don't.

1168
00:45:06.254 --> 00:45:09.084
- Let us bow to you. - I don't want you to.

1169
00:45:09.154 --> 00:45:10.354
Why would you bow to me?

1170
00:45:10.354 --> 00:45:12.453
Please give us the rent back in return.

1171
00:45:12.453 --> 00:45:14.093
- No way. - Wanna One's bowing to you.

1172
00:45:14.093 --> 00:45:15.124
No. Please don't.

1173
00:45:15.124 --> 00:45:16.533
It's Wanna One who wants to bow to you.

1174
00:45:16.533 --> 00:45:20.033
It doesn't matter if it's Wanna One or Two Two.

1175
00:45:20.303 --> 00:45:22.033
- Two Two? - Why would you bow to me...

1176
00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:23.504
we're getting old together anyway.

1177
00:45:23.504 --> 00:45:25.174
- It's okay. - 1, 2, 3.

1178
00:45:25.433 --> 00:45:26.604
(1, 2, 3.)

1179
00:45:26.703 --> 00:45:28.544
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

1180
00:45:28.544 --> 00:45:30.113
(Happy New Year.)

1181
00:45:31.343 --> 00:45:32.674
No, no.

1182
00:45:32.674 --> 00:45:34.413
I won't accept your bow.

1183
00:45:34.413 --> 00:45:36.214
Don't do that.

1184
00:45:36.354 --> 00:45:37.484
I can't believe him.

1185
00:45:37.484 --> 00:45:38.814
(He won't let them bow to him.)

1186
00:45:38.814 --> 00:45:40.384
Don't bow to me. Why would you?

1187
00:45:40.384 --> 00:45:42.794
I can't believe he's doing that not to return the money.

1188
00:45:42.794 --> 00:45:44.093
He just lied down.

1189
00:45:44.093 --> 00:45:46.223
That's ridiculous. You don't need to bow.

1190
00:45:46.823 --> 00:45:48.863
We're getting old together, aren't we?

1191
00:45:49.933 --> 00:45:51.334
(You win.)

1192
00:45:51.334 --> 00:45:52.863
- Now, let's... - Okay.

1193
00:45:53.504 --> 00:45:55.363
- pick the ones to scrub my back. - All right.

1194
00:45:56.073 --> 00:45:58.334
Let's play a game to pick two.

1195
00:45:58.334 --> 00:45:59.404
- Let's put the tables away. - Okay.

1196
00:45:59.404 --> 00:46:00.674
Move them as they are.

1197
00:46:00.674 --> 00:46:01.743
Lift it.

1198
00:46:01.973 --> 00:46:03.214
This is so much fun.

1199
00:46:03.214 --> 00:46:04.513
(Who will be the ones to scrub the back?)

1200
00:46:05.843 --> 00:46:06.843
(These three...)

1201
00:46:06.843 --> 00:46:08.613
(start to live together...)

1202
00:46:08.613 --> 00:46:09.814
(with swagger.)

1203
00:46:10.453 --> 00:46:12.484
(It gets hot from the beginning.)

1204
00:46:13.254 --> 00:46:14.524
(Their living together doesn't seem to be ordinary.)

1205
00:46:14.924 --> 00:46:16.694
(She introduces their room.)

1206
00:46:17.124 --> 00:46:18.993
(But the bathroom in that room is...)

1207
00:46:18.993 --> 00:46:20.194
(used as a storage now.)

1208
00:46:21.163 --> 00:46:22.624
(Since they ate something,)

1209
00:46:23.064 --> 00:46:25.533
(they try to clean it up,)

1210
00:46:25.893 --> 00:46:29.234
(but it is beyond their imagination.)

1211
00:46:29.504 --> 00:46:30.674
You're meticulous.

1212
00:46:30.674 --> 00:46:31.874
(Flustered)

1213
00:46:32.303 --> 00:46:33.343
First...

1214
00:46:34.803 --> 00:46:35.944
Please take them.

1215
00:46:36.004 --> 00:46:37.243
Anyway...

1216
00:46:37.944 --> 00:46:39.643
Eun Young, we'll clean it up.

1217
00:46:40.944 --> 00:46:43.013
Leave it to us, and you take some rest.

1218
00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:46.154
(Working hard)

1219
00:46:46.323 --> 00:46:48.124
- Should I take them to the rooftop? - Yes.

1220
00:46:49.283 --> 00:46:50.593
Is that the only place to store them in?

1221
00:46:50.593 --> 00:46:51.654
(The stuff from the bathroom should go to the rooftop.)

1222
00:46:52.493 --> 00:46:54.823
(2PM, the charismatic and sexy idol star...)

1223
00:46:55.624 --> 00:46:58.533
(mesmerizes fans on stages.)

1224
00:46:59.634 --> 00:47:03.104
(But today, they're just like porters.)

1225
00:47:04.303 --> 00:47:07.143
(Chan Sung comes up to the rooftop first.)

1226
00:47:08.604 --> 00:47:11.874
(He puts the first bag on the floor.)

1227
00:47:12.843 --> 00:47:14.283
This is not easy.

1228
00:47:15.513 --> 00:47:17.654
(It's tiring from the start.)

1229
00:47:18.654 --> 00:47:20.283
That looks so heavy... Gosh.

1230
00:47:21.984 --> 00:47:23.654
(Woo Young, the second porter, comes up next.)

1231
00:47:23.654 --> 00:47:24.723
Goodness.

1232
00:47:25.354 --> 00:47:27.694
(The bag seems to be full of stuff.)

1233
00:47:29.363 --> 00:47:31.533
(While Chan Sung and Woo Young are using their strength...)

1234
00:47:31.533 --> 00:47:32.533
Maybe she studied abroad.

1235
00:47:32.803 --> 00:47:33.834
I think so.

1236
00:47:34.803 --> 00:47:39.444
(Cheetah is filling in toiletries in the toilet cabinet.)

1237
00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:43.073
(She feels sorry to make them work hard.)

1238
00:47:44.314 --> 00:47:46.643
(I'm not familiar with this space.)

1239
00:47:47.743 --> 00:47:50.214
(They're not finished yet.)

1240
00:47:50.484 --> 00:47:53.024
Please do not fast-forward the tape.

1241
00:47:53.024 --> 00:47:54.984
You should air all the work we've been doing.

1242
00:47:57.823 --> 00:48:00.163
(Now that you've mentioned,)

1243
00:48:01.263 --> 00:48:04.093
(we're fast-forwarding the tape and showing all their work.)

1244
00:48:07.803 --> 00:48:08.863
Let me carry that.

1245
00:48:08.863 --> 00:48:10.073
(They worked so hard for a while.)

1246
00:48:10.573 --> 00:48:12.234
- Is this the last one? - Yes.

1247
00:48:14.044 --> 00:48:15.404
(While he's moving the last item,)

1248
00:48:16.113 --> 00:48:17.973
(he got caught by the doorknob.)

1249
00:48:18.913 --> 00:48:21.413
(Floundering)

1250
00:48:22.084 --> 00:48:26.283
(They're done with moving stuff after a lot of struggle.)

1251
00:48:28.953 --> 00:48:30.754
- It must have been hard. - Yes.

1252
00:48:30.754 --> 00:48:32.323
I'm sorry. You hate me, don't you?

1253
00:48:32.323 --> 00:48:33.993
Chan Sung struggled more than I did.

1254
00:48:33.993 --> 00:48:35.124
(Cheetah and Woo Young go up to the rooftop.)

1255
00:48:35.794 --> 00:48:37.393
- With this plastic bag... - Shall we cover them?

1256
00:48:37.393 --> 00:48:38.393
(Just in case it rains.)

1257
00:48:39.134 --> 00:48:40.564
Let's pile them up first.

1258
00:48:40.564 --> 00:48:41.834
(They're meticulous to the last touch.)

1259
00:48:43.604 --> 00:48:46.544
I think we should put this underneath like this.

1260
00:48:47.104 --> 00:48:48.604
- Please give it to me. - Or shall we wrap this way?

1261
00:48:48.604 --> 00:48:49.714
Give it to me.

1262
00:48:49.714 --> 00:48:51.073
- You should turn it around. - Turn it around.

1263
00:48:53.214 --> 00:48:55.243
(Wrapping the stuff carefully)

1264
00:48:55.384 --> 00:48:58.113
- No... Okay. - Like this.

1265
00:48:58.113 --> 00:48:59.823
And add this.

1266
00:48:59.823 --> 00:49:00.953
(Fixing it with the cat stroller)

1267
00:49:00.953 --> 00:49:02.424
- Let's fix it. - Park it.

1268
00:49:02.754 --> 00:49:03.893
What do you think?

1269
00:49:03.893 --> 00:49:04.953
It's good.

1270
00:49:04.953 --> 00:49:06.493
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1271
00:49:07.223 --> 00:49:09.263
- Are we done? - Yes, we are.

1272
00:49:09.263 --> 00:49:10.663
(Cheetah's stuff is wrapped carefully now.)

1273
00:49:10.933 --> 00:49:12.093
- It's done. - It is, right?

1274
00:49:12.093 --> 00:49:13.163
Yes.

1275
00:49:13.163 --> 00:49:14.564
(It's over. Let's go down.)

1276
00:49:15.303 --> 00:49:17.374
- Shall we go out? - Okay.

1277
00:49:17.433 --> 00:49:19.274
- Let's go out. - All right.

1278
00:49:20.774 --> 00:49:23.913
(The three housemates go out together.)

1279
00:49:24.814 --> 00:49:27.384
(They look like close friends from the same neighborhood.)

1280
00:49:27.814 --> 00:49:30.384
- Okay. - It's been a long time since you...

1281
00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:31.584
have gone to an LP bar, Chan Sung, right?

1282
00:49:31.584 --> 00:49:32.854
It's been a really long time.

1283
00:49:33.323 --> 00:49:35.984
Have you been there, Eun Young?

1284
00:49:35.984 --> 00:49:38.154
Yes. I know that place too. It's been a long time for me too.

1285
00:49:38.154 --> 00:49:40.863
I came here right after it opened,

1286
00:49:40.863 --> 00:49:42.393
- and I couldn't come... - Then...

1287
00:49:42.393 --> 00:49:43.663
it's almost one and a half year ago.

1288
00:49:43.663 --> 00:49:44.663
(They're following Woo Young, a regular here.)

1289
00:49:45.964 --> 00:49:47.964
(Cozy atmosphere...)

1290
00:49:49.334 --> 00:49:52.104
(with retro themes)

1291
00:49:53.104 --> 00:49:55.473
(Woo Young's favorite place for analog music)

1292
00:49:56.073 --> 00:49:58.374
(Woo Young's autograph proves he's a regular.)

1293
00:49:59.044 --> 00:50:01.243
He'll be so happy to see you.

1294
00:50:05.683 --> 00:50:07.924
(Screaming)

1295
00:50:08.823 --> 00:50:10.624
Chan Sung came too. Awesome.

1296
00:50:10.624 --> 00:50:11.624
(They gladly greet each other.)

1297
00:50:11.624 --> 00:50:12.763
- Hello. - Cheetah...

1298
00:50:12.763 --> 00:50:14.663
- Hi. - says she's been here too.

1299
00:50:14.663 --> 00:50:16.663
- Yes. She was here four times. - She was?

1300
00:50:16.663 --> 00:50:17.663
I remember her.

1301
00:50:18.294 --> 00:50:20.203
- Nice to see you. - You too.

1302
00:50:20.263 --> 00:50:21.303
It's been such a long time, Chan Sung.

1303
00:50:21.303 --> 00:50:23.504
(Chan Sung also seems to be a regular.)

1304
00:50:23.504 --> 00:50:26.774
I have my own playlist here.

1305
00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:27.874
Sure, you do.

1306
00:50:27.874 --> 00:50:30.113
It feels much warmer than before.

1307
00:50:30.113 --> 00:50:31.274
You mean the atmosphere? Isn't that right?

1308
00:50:31.314 --> 00:50:32.343
It's because the heater is on.

1309
00:50:33.814 --> 00:50:34.884
(What a flat joke.)

1310
00:50:35.283 --> 00:50:38.053
- There is Jin Young behind. - Hello.

1311
00:50:38.053 --> 00:50:39.113
(Park Jin Young's LP is displayed.)

1312
00:50:39.113 --> 00:50:40.154
"To Nichkhun"?

1313
00:50:40.924 --> 00:50:42.524
(To Nichkhun)

1314
00:50:42.624 --> 00:50:44.654
- What is that? - I don't know either.

1315
00:50:45.124 --> 00:50:46.524
- How come it's here? - It's Nichkhun's.

1316
00:50:46.524 --> 00:50:48.424
- Nichkhun's? - It's Nichkhun's,

1317
00:50:48.493 --> 00:50:50.263
but he hasn't come to collect it.

1318
00:50:50.694 --> 00:50:52.694
- He hasn't taken it yet? - No.

1319
00:50:52.694 --> 00:50:53.763
I kept it for him.

1320
00:50:54.504 --> 00:50:56.874
I've never seen an LP that's kept for someone.

1321
00:50:58.004 --> 00:50:59.073
You're right.

1322
00:50:59.073 --> 00:51:00.674
- Me neither. - I've seen liquor kept,

1323
00:51:00.674 --> 00:51:02.143
but not an LP.

1324
00:51:02.544 --> 00:51:03.774
This is the first time.

1325
00:51:03.774 --> 00:51:05.413
(Nichkhun, please take this soon. From Park Jin Young)

1326
00:51:05.513 --> 00:51:06.584
It's quite old.

1327
00:51:06.984 --> 00:51:09.044
- The drinks are here. - Thank you.

1328
00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:11.754
- The glasses are tall. - Thank you.

1329
00:51:13.024 --> 00:51:14.124
(They drink together for the first time.)

1330
00:51:14.124 --> 00:51:15.283
Let's have a drink.

1331
00:51:17.154 --> 00:51:18.794
(Gulping)

1332
00:51:20.263 --> 00:51:22.163
I almost drank all of it, you know?

1333
00:51:26.634 --> 00:51:27.634
Look at him.

1334
00:51:27.703 --> 00:51:28.703
Because he likes Maxwell.

1335
00:51:28.703 --> 00:51:29.703
(Gosh. This song is my favorite.)

1336
00:51:29.703 --> 00:51:30.933
This is for Chan Sung.

1337
00:51:31.073 --> 00:51:33.104
- He is quick-witted. - I love you.

1338
00:51:33.104 --> 00:51:35.643
- He is suddenly melting. - Goodness.

1339
00:51:35.643 --> 00:51:36.674
He is so quick-witted.

1340
00:51:36.973 --> 00:51:38.674
My spinal erector muscles are loosening now.

1341
00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:41.243
Incredible.

1342
00:51:41.243 --> 00:51:42.243
(Your expression is funny.)

1343
00:51:44.053 --> 00:51:45.084
This is really good.

1344
00:51:45.354 --> 00:51:47.584
Since it's been a long time...

1345
00:51:47.584 --> 00:51:49.493
- Why do you like Maxwell so much? - Well...

1346
00:51:50.553 --> 00:51:51.823
That man is...

1347
00:51:52.354 --> 00:51:54.323
- Do you like Maxwell Coffee too? - No.

1348
00:51:54.624 --> 00:51:56.363
That was surely funny.

1349
00:51:59.564 --> 00:52:00.803
(Woo Young lowers his head.)

1350
00:52:00.803 --> 00:52:02.973
You should be scolded for the lame joke.

1351
00:52:02.973 --> 00:52:07.374
I think I was attacked by Cheetah.

1352
00:52:07.743 --> 00:52:09.243
- It was like... - Good job.

1353
00:52:09.243 --> 00:52:11.573
- a cheetah slapping my cheek. - It was so hard.

1354
00:52:11.643 --> 00:52:12.944
- It's okay. - Goodness.

1355
00:52:12.944 --> 00:52:14.143
You're ignoring me now.

1356
00:52:16.654 --> 00:52:19.354
Are we going to everyone's favorite place tonight?

1357
00:52:20.024 --> 00:52:21.424
(It sounds good.)

1358
00:52:21.924 --> 00:52:24.953
Let's go to all the three places.

1359
00:52:24.953 --> 00:52:26.064
That's a nice place.

1360
00:52:26.064 --> 00:52:27.064
(Chan Sung suggests the idea on the spot.)

1361
00:52:27.464 --> 00:52:29.263
You can speak to me casually now. It's okay.

1362
00:52:29.593 --> 00:52:31.694
- It's all right. - Let's make it clear.

1363
00:52:31.694 --> 00:52:32.734
(They haven't decided how to address yet.)

1364
00:52:32.734 --> 00:52:36.134
It's okay to speak casually to us,

1365
00:52:36.134 --> 00:52:38.404
but you should decide if you'll treat him as an older guy or not.

1366
00:52:38.404 --> 00:52:39.643
You can call me by my first name.

1367
00:52:39.973 --> 00:52:42.073
- Chan Sung. - But when there are other people,

1368
00:52:42.203 --> 00:52:45.113
please don't call me, "hey".

1369
00:52:45.113 --> 00:52:46.444
Then should I call you Chan Sung?

1370
00:52:46.513 --> 00:52:49.113
- Yes. It's okay. - Then I sound like an older one.

1371
00:52:49.113 --> 00:52:51.053
- Do you think so? - You don't look younger than us.

1372
00:52:52.884 --> 00:52:54.854
Wait. I think you're picking a fight now.

1373
00:52:56.053 --> 00:52:57.624
(Looking away)

1374
00:52:57.624 --> 00:53:00.863
- Then... - We're all on the same level.

1375
00:53:00.863 --> 00:53:02.323
Yes, we are.

1376
00:53:02.323 --> 00:53:04.593
Is it because we're about the same age?

1377
00:53:04.734 --> 00:53:07.203
I think we speak the same language.

1378
00:53:10.174 --> 00:53:11.774
When Cheetah came here last time,

1379
00:53:12.404 --> 00:53:14.604
she was quite drunk.

1380
00:53:14.973 --> 00:53:17.343
She asked me to play a sad song sung by a female singer,

1381
00:53:17.343 --> 00:53:18.573
so I played this one.

1382
00:53:20.044 --> 00:53:22.143
- He remembers everything. - He does.

1383
00:53:22.214 --> 00:53:23.254
I do.

1384
00:53:23.254 --> 00:53:24.683
(This is the stool she was sitting on.)

1385
00:53:24.683 --> 00:53:26.183
Usually, those who sit over there...

1386
00:53:26.183 --> 00:53:27.453
have sad stories inside.

1387
00:53:28.323 --> 00:53:29.453
(A woman who had a sad story inside)

1388
00:53:29.453 --> 00:53:30.493
- Over there. - The bar stools?

1389
00:53:30.493 --> 00:53:31.524
- Yes. - I see.

1390
00:53:31.754 --> 00:53:33.163
- Are you going to do headbanging? - I was sitting like this.

1391
00:53:33.163 --> 00:53:34.794
- Wait. - Hold on.

1392
00:53:34.794 --> 00:53:37.033
- She's going to reenact. - Was this your pose?

1393
00:53:37.033 --> 00:53:39.504
- Was it? - I think I can suddenly remember.

1394
00:53:40.763 --> 00:53:42.033
You can sit over here for a moment.

1395
00:53:43.504 --> 00:53:45.104
I'm okay these days though.

1396
00:53:46.004 --> 00:53:48.944
Why? I don't need to sit over there.

1397
00:53:49.444 --> 00:53:50.973
- "I'm okay." - I'm fine.

1398
00:53:50.973 --> 00:53:52.143
I don't have a sad story inside these days.

1399
00:53:53.783 --> 00:53:55.643
Why do you think you liked this song?

1400
00:53:57.214 --> 00:53:58.714
(Well...)

1401
00:53:58.884 --> 00:54:03.524
Because the music was like touching me.

1402
00:54:03.524 --> 00:54:04.553
Oh, my.

1403
00:54:05.124 --> 00:54:06.823
Because the music was like touching me.

1404
00:54:07.124 --> 00:54:08.124
(Oh, my.)

1405
00:54:08.464 --> 00:54:12.363
(Their eyes are shaking recklessly.)

1406
00:54:12.564 --> 00:54:14.663
- It was like hugging me. - Saying it's okay?

1407
00:54:16.874 --> 00:54:17.904
(We knew that's what you meant too.)

1408
00:54:17.904 --> 00:54:19.174
That was quite a poetic expression.

1409
00:54:19.743 --> 00:54:20.803
It was like touching her.

1410
00:54:20.803 --> 00:54:21.803
(Realizing it is poetic a little later)

1411
00:54:22.674 --> 00:54:26.113
I used to do ballet...

1412
00:54:26.113 --> 00:54:28.843
when I was in elementary school.

1413
00:54:28.843 --> 00:54:29.913
When you were in elementary school?

1414
00:54:30.183 --> 00:54:32.884
And then you became a rapper later?

1415
00:54:33.024 --> 00:54:35.484
After that, I started to sing.

1416
00:54:36.254 --> 00:54:38.893
With other aspiring singers,

1417
00:54:38.893 --> 00:54:40.024
I performed on the streets.

1418
00:54:40.024 --> 00:54:42.093
Together with other musicians,

1419
00:54:42.093 --> 00:54:43.933
I sang and danced on stage.

1420
00:54:44.134 --> 00:54:46.933
Then I had an accident,

1421
00:54:46.933 --> 00:54:50.834
and I had a hard time because I was badly hurt.

1422
00:54:51.703 --> 00:54:53.843
So I took some time to rest,

1423
00:54:54.343 --> 00:54:55.904
and turned into a rapper.

1424
00:54:56.774 --> 00:54:58.843
As a matter of fact,

1425
00:54:59.743 --> 00:55:01.544
your voice was...

1426
00:55:01.544 --> 00:55:04.013
She let me listen to the song she was working on.

1427
00:55:04.013 --> 00:55:06.984
When I listened to it, I was very surprised.

1428
00:55:07.283 --> 00:55:10.254
It was different from what I had seen on TV.

1429
00:55:10.254 --> 00:55:12.024
- Right. - So...

1430
00:55:12.223 --> 00:55:13.763
isn't it all right for you to sing?

1431
00:55:13.863 --> 00:55:15.163
It's okay now.

1432
00:55:15.564 --> 00:55:17.663
- Now? - I'm not good enough anymore.

1433
00:55:17.993 --> 00:55:19.703
- That's not true. - I'm not as good as before.

1434
00:55:20.104 --> 00:55:23.674
I'd really like my music...

1435
00:55:24.504 --> 00:55:27.473
to be of comfort and encouragement...

1436
00:55:27.703 --> 00:55:30.113
to someone...

1437
00:55:30.113 --> 00:55:32.113
- like it did a while ago. - Right.

1438
00:55:32.113 --> 00:55:33.384
- You can do it. - I'd really want that.

1439
00:55:33.384 --> 00:55:34.444
It will be.

1440
00:55:35.314 --> 00:55:36.453
It sure will be.

1441
00:55:36.453 --> 00:55:37.613
It will be.

1442
00:55:38.183 --> 00:55:40.283
- Is that right? - Right.

1443
00:55:41.154 --> 00:55:43.093
Release a new album already.

1444
00:55:43.493 --> 00:55:45.024
Once it gets released,

1445
00:55:45.694 --> 00:55:46.924
we'll help you promote it.

1446
00:55:47.663 --> 00:55:49.124
(Touched)

1447
00:55:49.323 --> 00:55:50.893
We will for certain.

1448
00:55:50.893 --> 00:55:52.363
(Because we're housemates.)

1449
00:55:53.763 --> 00:55:57.703
(The three housemates become united with music.)

1450
00:55:58.573 --> 00:56:00.073
He's playing music for us.

1451
00:56:00.643 --> 00:56:02.404
It's nothing special.

1452
00:56:04.113 --> 00:56:05.674
(DJing)

1453
00:56:07.113 --> 00:56:08.214
You know what this song is, right?

1454
00:56:10.183 --> 00:56:11.283
"Good Times".

1455
00:56:11.513 --> 00:56:13.283
It was so famous.

1456
00:56:13.654 --> 00:56:16.223
(It makes them groove to the music.)

1457
00:56:17.024 --> 00:56:19.354
(Dancing)

1458
00:56:20.393 --> 00:56:22.393
I should do something like this. Are you having fun?

1459
00:56:24.134 --> 00:56:27.303
A cup of soda for table one.

1460
00:56:27.564 --> 00:56:28.663
You need to do this.

1461
00:56:28.663 --> 00:56:29.933
(Our DJ is playful.)

1462
00:56:30.134 --> 00:56:32.073
This song is for Cheetah.

1463
00:56:32.073 --> 00:56:33.104
(Next song is for Cheetah.)

1464
00:56:33.104 --> 00:56:34.303
I should get ready.

1465
00:56:36.004 --> 00:56:37.044
This?

1466
00:56:37.044 --> 00:56:38.214
I told you she'd stand up.

1467
00:56:38.214 --> 00:56:40.143
(She can't help but stand up after listening to this familiar intro.)

1468
00:56:40.584 --> 00:56:42.243
You know this.

1469
00:56:42.243 --> 00:56:44.953
It feels like La Canada, right?

1470
00:56:44.953 --> 00:56:47.354
- Shake, shake. - This is it.

1471
00:56:48.223 --> 00:56:49.223
(Let's go.)

1472
00:56:50.754 --> 00:56:52.823
(She's immersed in her dancing.)

1473
00:56:54.723 --> 00:56:58.363
(Dancing together)

1474
00:56:59.464 --> 00:57:02.363
She's got moves.

1475
00:57:02.604 --> 00:57:04.374
(Her dancing spirit explodes all of a sudden.)

1476
00:57:05.504 --> 00:57:06.573
Shake it.

1477
00:57:06.573 --> 00:57:07.774
(Like this?)

1478
00:57:08.473 --> 00:57:09.573
She's got moves.

1479
00:57:10.343 --> 00:57:11.513
Goodness.

1480
00:57:11.513 --> 00:57:13.183
Even after years.

1481
00:57:14.044 --> 00:57:15.613
(She's a bit embarrassed.)

1482
00:57:15.613 --> 00:57:17.013
It's been such a long time, right?

1483
00:57:17.513 --> 00:57:20.323
(He comes back to his place after bringing up the mood.)

1484
00:57:20.524 --> 00:57:23.124
- Shall we get things started? - Let's go.

1485
00:57:23.694 --> 00:57:25.453
- Let's get it. - Let's go.

1486
00:57:26.564 --> 00:57:30.194
(Flowing with the beat)

1487
00:57:31.794 --> 00:57:32.933
Cheers.

1488
00:57:33.834 --> 00:57:36.203
Thank you.

1489
00:57:37.334 --> 00:57:40.143
(Chan Sung with the groove)

1490
00:57:41.374 --> 00:57:43.513
(Cheetah with a lot of stories behind her)

1491
00:57:45.274 --> 00:57:47.843
(And DJ Woo Young with tacky jokes)

1492
00:57:49.143 --> 00:57:51.283
(Their night is unstoppable.)

1493
00:57:52.484 --> 00:57:55.683
I visit this place about five days a week.

1494
00:57:56.854 --> 00:58:00.464
The music is on in this place as well.

1495
00:58:00.863 --> 00:58:02.624
What a nice mood.

1496
00:58:02.624 --> 00:58:05.134
(Cheetah recommends this place.)

1497
00:58:05.134 --> 00:58:06.203
It has a nice mood.

1498
00:58:06.303 --> 00:58:08.533
- It's great here. - I know.

1499
00:58:09.033 --> 00:58:10.604
This looks dangerous.

1500
00:58:10.973 --> 00:58:12.303
You'll be surprised when you taste this.

1501
00:58:12.674 --> 00:58:13.774
Gosh, the scent of truffles.

1502
00:58:13.774 --> 00:58:15.473
(Mixing it nicely)

1503
00:58:15.643 --> 00:58:17.073
I can smell truffles.

1504
00:58:17.444 --> 00:58:19.484
What scent? Truffle?

1505
00:58:19.743 --> 00:58:21.243
(What do you think?)

1506
00:58:21.783 --> 00:58:23.183
(Slurping)

1507
00:58:26.754 --> 00:58:27.823
It's good.

1508
00:58:27.953 --> 00:58:29.053
It's no joke.

1509
00:58:29.053 --> 00:58:30.493
(Proud)

1510
00:58:30.953 --> 00:58:32.453
(Food is one thing.)

1511
00:58:32.964 --> 00:58:35.624
Can't you show us how you groove? What you showed us a while ago.

1512
00:58:36.464 --> 00:58:38.763
I only did this a while ago.

1513
00:58:39.163 --> 00:58:40.263
Forget it.

1514
00:58:40.263 --> 00:58:41.933
(Don't be like this.)

1515
00:58:42.634 --> 00:58:46.243
I won't leave unless I see how she dances.

1516
00:58:46.774 --> 00:58:47.874
Please don't.

1517
00:58:47.874 --> 00:58:49.743
- If you're like this, - What?

1518
00:58:49.743 --> 00:58:53.044
- it'll be uncomfortable for me. - I'll dance too.

1519
00:58:53.044 --> 00:58:54.183
I'll dance too.

1520
00:58:54.584 --> 00:58:56.053
- You heard her, right? - What?

1521
00:58:56.053 --> 00:58:57.384
You just need to make her feel comfortable.

1522
00:58:57.384 --> 00:58:58.484
Okay.

1523
00:58:59.683 --> 00:59:00.783
Dance to the rhythm already.

1524
00:59:02.754 --> 00:59:04.953
(She feels extremely uncomfortable.)

1525
00:59:06.163 --> 00:59:08.524
(They're helpless.)

1526
00:59:08.524 --> 00:59:09.663
Take it easy.

1527
00:59:09.893 --> 00:59:11.893
Sir, can you play some fast songs?

1528
00:59:11.893 --> 00:59:13.433
- Something groovy. - Goodness.

1529
00:59:14.734 --> 00:59:16.634
Let's go.

1530
00:59:17.433 --> 00:59:19.504
- Let's do it one by one. - All right.

1531
00:59:19.904 --> 00:59:21.774
- Well... - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1532
00:59:21.774 --> 00:59:23.073
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Let's dance in turns.

1533
00:59:23.073 --> 00:59:24.243
The loser will dance first.

1534
00:59:24.413 --> 00:59:28.384
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1535
00:59:29.044 --> 00:59:30.314
(Woo Young wins.)

1536
00:59:31.953 --> 00:59:32.953
(Screaming)

1537
00:59:34.183 --> 00:59:35.854
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1538
00:59:35.924 --> 00:59:38.223
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1539
00:59:38.223 --> 00:59:40.163
(Cheetah loses.)

1540
00:59:40.263 --> 00:59:43.093
- Wait. - That's it.

1541
00:59:43.694 --> 00:59:46.163
5, 4, 3, Woo Young.

1542
00:59:47.134 --> 00:59:48.263
(Surprised)

1543
00:59:48.663 --> 00:59:49.973
Woo Young.

1544
00:59:50.334 --> 00:59:52.303
(Sexy)

1545
00:59:52.303 --> 00:59:54.843
Hold on. Hold on. Goodness.

1546
00:59:55.973 --> 00:59:57.044
I'm in love with your body

1547
00:59:57.714 --> 00:59:59.444
(Oh my goodness.)

1548
01:00:02.513 --> 01:00:04.754
(Enticing)

1549
01:00:06.453 --> 01:00:07.924
Gosh, this customer...

1550
01:00:07.924 --> 01:00:09.283
(She shows off her fatal charms.)

1551
01:00:10.754 --> 01:00:11.754
(Exclaiming)

1552
01:00:12.294 --> 01:00:13.294
(Exclaiming)

1553
01:00:15.163 --> 01:00:19.334
(They're like two loud sirens.)

1554
01:00:20.404 --> 01:00:22.363
(She waves her hand in a sexy manner.)

1555
01:00:22.363 --> 01:00:24.803
(Her sexy dance was hot.)

1556
01:00:25.234 --> 01:00:27.944
4, 3, 2, 1.

1557
01:00:27.944 --> 01:00:29.004
(Next is Woo Young's turn.)

1558
01:00:29.743 --> 01:00:31.874
(Feeling the groove)

1559
01:00:32.444 --> 01:00:34.714
(His dance moves are restrained.)

1560
01:00:36.214 --> 01:00:37.714
(He gives a relaxed smile.)

1561
01:00:39.854 --> 01:00:41.924
(Keeping the vibe,)

1562
01:00:42.683 --> 01:00:45.393
(Chan Sung takes his last turn.)

1563
01:00:46.663 --> 01:00:48.564
(Shouting)

1564
01:00:48.564 --> 01:00:50.263
(Go for it!)

1565
01:00:52.064 --> 01:00:54.404
(His dance moves are energetic.)

1566
01:00:54.404 --> 01:00:56.234
Yea, I feel it coming.

1567
01:00:56.234 --> 01:00:57.703
It's fabulous.

1568
01:00:59.374 --> 01:01:01.174
He's dancing purely out of excitement.

1569
01:01:01.573 --> 01:01:02.913
It's like a performance art.

1570
01:01:05.573 --> 01:01:08.544
(Performer Chan Sung's elegant dance moves...)

1571
01:01:10.854 --> 01:01:17.823
(go well with any kind of music.)

1572
01:01:19.464 --> 01:01:20.964
(They finish showing off their dance moves.)

1573
01:01:20.964 --> 01:01:23.234
- What are you saying? - Good job.

1574
01:01:24.433 --> 01:01:28.604
(Let's have some real fun now.)

1575
01:01:29.904 --> 01:01:33.274
(They dance like they'll take over the beat.)

1576
01:01:34.174 --> 01:01:37.473
(Let's have fun together, baby.)

1577
01:01:38.674 --> 01:01:42.613
(It's the best free-style housemates ever.)

1578
01:01:44.183 --> 01:01:45.613
(They visit Chan Sung's regular place last.)

1579
01:01:45.613 --> 01:01:47.654
It's been such a long time to visit here for me too.

1580
01:01:48.354 --> 01:01:49.593
It's so fun.

1581
01:01:50.294 --> 01:01:51.854
Gosh, Cheetah.

1582
01:01:52.964 --> 01:01:54.064
It's great.

1583
01:01:54.064 --> 01:01:55.124
(The youth never gets tired.)

1584
01:01:55.124 --> 01:01:56.263
Goodness.

1585
01:01:56.933 --> 01:02:00.703
Chan Sung has his schedule tomorrow,

1586
01:02:01.104 --> 01:02:02.303
- so let's end our night here. - Really?

1587
01:02:02.874 --> 01:02:04.404
- Then... - Shall we say cheers?

1588
01:02:05.404 --> 01:02:07.444
- Shall we? - Shall we?

1589
01:02:08.573 --> 01:02:10.374
- Did you mean by this? - Yes.

1590
01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:11.874
(They're just like neighborhood friends now.)

(They've agreed to end their night,)

1592
01:02:15.613 --> 01:02:18.484
(but as they keep on laughing and talking.)

1593
01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:23.124
(They continue enjoying their night.)

1594
01:02:25.854 --> 01:02:30.064
(They don't realize the time passing as their night deepens.)

1595
01:02:30.993 --> 01:02:35.033
(They arrive home after 3am.)

1596
01:02:36.604 --> 01:02:38.174
(They get ready to go to bed.)

1597
01:02:38.174 --> 01:02:39.334
Gureum.

1598
01:02:40.374 --> 01:02:42.843
(Cheetah has a cotton pad on her hand.)

1599
01:02:46.584 --> 01:02:49.783
(She calmly removes her makeup.)

1600
01:02:50.754 --> 01:02:53.484
(She washes her face.)

1601
01:02:58.694 --> 01:02:59.763
I'm doomed.

1602
01:03:01.564 --> 01:03:04.263
(Whatever)

1603
01:03:05.893 --> 01:03:08.904
Gosh. Hello, Eun Young.

1604
01:03:09.573 --> 01:03:11.334
Well, it's...

1605
01:03:11.573 --> 01:03:13.044
It's nice to meet you.

1606
01:03:14.274 --> 01:03:16.314
- Don't stare at me. - Well...

1607
01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:17.413
What?

1608
01:03:19.843 --> 01:03:21.343
It's not so different.

1609
01:03:22.183 --> 01:03:23.354
It's not the same either, is it?

1610
01:03:24.053 --> 01:03:25.154
What?

1611
01:03:25.553 --> 01:03:27.823
Of course, it's not.

1612
01:03:28.254 --> 01:03:30.654
- I see no bubble, but it's working? - Yes.

1613
01:03:32.524 --> 01:03:34.093
- Well... - Have you seen Eun Young?

1614
01:03:34.093 --> 01:03:35.194
No.

1615
01:03:35.624 --> 01:03:37.533
- Have you? - No, I haven't.

1616
01:03:37.593 --> 01:03:39.703
Who is she? Is she your friend?

1617
01:03:40.334 --> 01:03:42.774
- Why is she here all of a sudden? - She's Eun Young's sister.

1618
01:03:44.104 --> 01:03:45.874
Eun Young doesn't have any siblings.

1619
01:03:46.343 --> 01:03:47.404
No.

1620
01:03:47.674 --> 01:03:49.473
- I think she's... - It's funny.

1621
01:03:49.473 --> 01:03:50.544
(Pretending to throw it)

1622
01:03:50.544 --> 01:03:52.073
Goodness, it surprised me.

1623
01:03:52.843 --> 01:03:53.984
Goodness, it surprised me.

1624
01:03:54.413 --> 01:03:55.714
Is she in the room?

1625
01:03:58.254 --> 01:03:59.453
When will Eun Young come home by the way?

1626
01:03:59.453 --> 01:04:01.584
(When will Eun Young come home by the way?)

1627
01:04:04.294 --> 01:04:05.553
Oh, yes.

1628
01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:10.194
He's coming. Be quiet for a second.

1629
01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:11.634
- What? - Quiet.

1630
01:04:12.294 --> 01:04:13.933
Tanyang is coming out.

1631
01:04:14.064 --> 01:04:16.174
- Is he? - Yes, wait.

1632
01:04:16.174 --> 01:04:18.073
- Quiet. - He's out.

1633
01:04:18.134 --> 01:04:21.573
Tanyang, you're finally out.

1634
01:04:21.674 --> 01:04:22.743
- He's out. - Come here.

1635
01:04:22.743 --> 01:04:23.843
Awesome.

1636
01:04:24.044 --> 01:04:26.743
- Goodness, you cutie pie. - He looks like something.

1637
01:04:26.743 --> 01:04:27.884
Gosh, he's heavy.

1638
01:04:28.444 --> 01:04:30.513
- It's our chance to get close. - Tanyang.

1639
01:04:30.513 --> 01:04:32.254
- Hi, Tanyang. - Hi.

1640
01:04:32.254 --> 01:04:33.384
He's finally out.

1641
01:04:33.624 --> 01:04:36.453
Will there be something I can win points from him?

1642
01:04:37.124 --> 01:04:39.024
Will there be something I can win points from him?

1643
01:04:39.624 --> 01:04:40.924
Just come out.

1644
01:04:40.924 --> 01:04:41.924
(He continues showing his foolish side.)

1645
01:04:42.223 --> 01:04:44.433
How can I win points from him?

1646
01:04:44.433 --> 01:04:45.564
He must not like this.

1647
01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:48.104
(Woo Young keeps on trying to win points.)

1648
01:04:48.104 --> 01:04:49.473
(Friendly)

1649
01:04:50.674 --> 01:04:52.533
Eun Young, how can I win his favor?

1650
01:04:53.404 --> 01:04:54.843
- Okay, I won't do it. - He doesn't like it.

1651
01:04:54.944 --> 01:04:55.973
I won't do it.

1652
01:04:55.973 --> 01:04:57.814
Eun Young, how can I win his favor?

1653
01:04:58.714 --> 01:05:00.143
- Okay, I won't do it. - He doesn't like it.

1654
01:05:00.243 --> 01:05:02.613
- I won't do it. - Okay.

1655
01:05:02.714 --> 01:05:03.884
Eun Young.

1656
01:05:04.553 --> 01:05:07.223
Open that thing on the far right.

1657
01:05:09.624 --> 01:05:11.694
- Here? - Are we bothering you?

1658
01:05:13.064 --> 01:05:14.593
- This? - He's going back in.

1659
01:05:14.593 --> 01:05:15.663
Yes.

1660
01:05:15.893 --> 01:05:18.533
He smelled it. He heard the sound.

1661
01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:20.263
Okay.

1662
01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:22.464
Open it.

1663
01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:23.834
(If you guys come to me suddenly...)

1664
01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:25.634
- My gosh. - Wait, hang on.

1665
01:05:26.544 --> 01:05:27.573
It's...

1666
01:05:28.073 --> 01:05:29.573
- Oh, my. - They're so cute.

1667
01:05:29.714 --> 01:05:32.243
Guys, this one came out too. He came out.

1668
01:05:33.314 --> 01:05:35.714
It looks like he's made up his mind to come out.

1669
01:05:36.113 --> 01:05:37.814
Call him like this. "Tanyang."

1670
01:05:37.814 --> 01:05:39.683
Tanyang, Tanyang.

1671
01:05:39.683 --> 01:05:42.084
(You're now watching housemates giving treats to their cats at 3am.)

1672
01:05:42.084 --> 01:05:43.424
You won't eat this?

1673
01:05:43.424 --> 01:05:45.323
Chubs, why didn't you come out sooner?

1674
01:05:45.323 --> 01:05:47.564
- I'm glad you finally came out. - Why?

1675
01:05:47.564 --> 01:05:48.694
You're a funny one.

1676
01:05:48.694 --> 01:05:50.834
I'm happy you finally came out. I'm going to bed now.

1677
01:05:53.104 --> 01:05:54.834
Chubs ate the treats.

1678
01:05:55.763 --> 01:05:57.674
I'm... Gosh, my legs.

1679
01:05:58.303 --> 01:06:00.104
I have to wake up early.

1680
01:06:01.643 --> 01:06:03.573
I'll go... I mean, I'll get some sleep now.

1681
01:06:04.513 --> 01:06:07.013
It doesn't look like they'll go back under the couch now.

1682
01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:09.884
They've decided to come out.

1683
01:06:11.113 --> 01:06:12.113
Let's go to bed.

1684
01:06:12.113 --> 01:06:13.683
- All right, let's sleep. - Good night.

1685
01:06:13.683 --> 01:06:15.654
- Bye, guys. - Good night.

1686
01:06:15.654 --> 01:06:17.093
- Bye-bye. - Bye.

1687
01:06:17.093 --> 01:06:18.854
(They're tired because they had too much fun today.)

1688
01:06:19.924 --> 01:06:23.794
(She flops into her bed.)

1689
01:06:25.018 --> 01:07:46.966
