1
00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:30.180
Kim Eun Jo,

2
00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:34.117
Eun Jo?

3
00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.454
Is this my real name?

4
00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.895
What was my brother's name?

5
00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:46.763
It's Eun Jo,

6
00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:51.068
"Eun" means kindness, and "Jo" means help,

7
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:53.603
Ha Eun Jo,

8
00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.642
It's hard to believe,

9
00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:03.480
Whenever I went to a friend's house when I was young,

10
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.716
I would be jealous of them having a brother or a sister,

11
00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:09.786
I also had a brother,

12
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.455
It's hard to call him your brother,

13
00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:15.158
He's old enough to be your father,

14
00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.794
How old would he be now?

15
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:19.196
Let me think,

16
00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:22.833
He was about 6 or 7,,,

17
00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.002
when I lost him,

18
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.939
He was about,,,

19
00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.575
Han Gyul's age right now,

20
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.610
If he is alive,

21
00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:37.914
he would be around 52 or 53,

22
00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.751
He really is old enough to be my dad,

23
00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:47.891
Is that why you never mentioned anything about dad to me?

24
00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.094
Was it because you were too sorry?

25
00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.331
My mother-in-law was horrible,

26
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:56.299
The moment I lost him,

27
00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.568
I was thrown out of that house,

28
00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:02.939
Goodness,

29
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:06.610
How was I born then?

30
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:10.080
I was born a long time after that,

31
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.416
After being thrown out, I didn't have a place to go,

32
00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:16.887
I did laundry for people at their house,

33
00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:20.223
People used to draw water from streams and wells,

34
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.525
I would draw water for people,

35
00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:25.962
Your father would visit me once in a while,

36
00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:27.998
He would give me some money,

37
00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:30.467
I became pregnant with you unexpectedly,

38
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:33.170
That is ridiculous, Are you stupid?

39
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.172
Why were you still attached to someone like that?

40
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.875
You could've changed your life when you were young,

41
00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.580
Did you inherit anything after Dad died?

42
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.649
How could I inherit anything?

43
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.951
The family threw me out empty-handed,,,

44
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:50.320
saying that I was the fault of losing their son,

45
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.123
I was worried about them finding about you and taking you away,

46
00:02:53.123 --> 00:02:56.493
So I took you and ran away to Seoul,

47
00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:58.295
Mom,

48
00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:01.398
If it wasn't for you,

49
00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:03.600
I would have died then,

50
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.435
It was so hard,

51
00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:08.071
You know Apgujeong, right?

52
00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:11.474
It used to be a cabbage field,,,

53
00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:15.512
where your feet would sink into the water,

54
00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:17.247
I did labor work there,

55
00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:20.217
I worked at a diner, I would buy some land there,,,

56
00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:21.451
whenever I earned money,

57
00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.688
Then I ran my own diner called "Foul-mouthed Diner",

58
00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:27.324
Whenever I earned money, I would buy 1,500 or 3,300mÂ² of land,,,

59
00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:28.725
and houses here and there,

60
00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.294
I ended up like this after that,

61
00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:35.765
Mom, don't you regret living like that?

62
00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.133
No,

63
00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:39.936
Why? Why don't you regret it?

64
00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:41.638
Because I have you,

65
00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:44.874
I would have died already,,,

66
00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:47.477
if I didn't have you,

67
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:50.814
I couldn't die when you are so pretty,,,

68
00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:55.051
and like a flower,

69
00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:58.188
This pretty thing belongs to me,

70
00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:00.824
Why would I regret anything?

71
00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:03.627
I don't regret anything,

72
00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:08.865
Mom,

73
00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.301
I'll do my best to treat you better,

74
00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:14.170
I'll live happily with So Won,,,

75
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.974
and raise Han Gyul well to not make you sad,

76
00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.944
Mom, I'm going to live happily,

77
00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:24.014
Okay,

78
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:28.318
If I cut him out because I don't like him,

79
00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:30.053
it will only hurt you,

80
00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:31.821
I understand that now,

81
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.925
Even if the situation's complicated,

82
00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:38.862
I'll try to accept this complicated situation,

83
00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:40.997
Let's try living like that,

84
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:03.887
I will leave now,

85
00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.822
Were you still here?

86
00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:08.825
I was late because I just got back from visiting Ae Ri at the hospital,

87
00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.260
How is Ae Ri?

88
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.263
Her bruises are worse than we thought, She'll stay for a few days,

89
00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.434
It seems like she was waiting for you to come,

90
00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:19.002
I don't want to see her yet,

91
00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.806
I'll see her after I decide what the truth is,

92
00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:27.944
I saw Ae Ri since she was a baby,

93
00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:30.680
She isn't cunning enough to do something like that,

94
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.884
Would you like a cup of tea?

95
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.762
You must've been thinking about that,,,

96
00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:48.698
seeing that you can't sleep,

97
00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:54.003
You won't understand,,,

98
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:57.507
how empty it feels to not know my parents,

99
00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:01.177
It feels like my heart is always empty,

100
00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.115
I'm fortunate to have met Tae Yang,

101
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.318
But I still feel very lonely sometimes,

102
00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:10.620
Is that why you want to find,,,

103
00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:14.190
that woman named "Ok"?

104
00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:16.259
I think "Ok" was,,,

105
00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:22.632
my stepmother,

106
00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:25.435
I called her by her name,

107
00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:28.438
and I dimly remember my father caning me,,,

108
00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:31.741
for not calling her "Mom",

109
00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:35.612
She probably died by now,

110
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.315
Even if she is alive, I don't want to meet her,

111
00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:42.519
She abandoned me at the train station,,,

112
00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.555
and didn't appear when I tried so hard to find her,

113
00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.125
That probably means that she erased me from her memories,

114
00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:51.861
Even if she appears in front of me,

115
00:06:52.262 --> 00:06:54.130
I don't want to meet her,

116
00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:55.932
You're right,

117
00:06:57.267 --> 00:06:59.068
Only Tae Yang and Ae Ri are,,,

118
00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:02.305
your real family,

119
00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:07.243
I guess so,

120
00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:21.558
What are you drawing so hard?

121
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.327
I want to give this as a present to Hat Granny,

122
00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.196
Really?

123
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:29.232
Let me see,

124
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.301
Let's see,

125
00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:37.674
Oh, my, You drew so well,

126
00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:39.742
Grandma,

127
00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:43.947
can't you live with us and not go back to America?

128
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.316
Why? Do you like me that much?

129
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:50.386
Why shouldn't I go back then?

130
00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.756
When Dad and I live with Yeon Ju,

131
00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:55.425
Grandpa will be alone,

132
00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.761
Grandpa will have bloody stool,,,

133
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:01.364
from only eating ramyeon,,,

134
00:08:01.364 --> 00:08:02.565
if he's alone,

135
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:06.503
Can't you cook for him?

136
00:08:06.503 --> 00:08:09.873
You're such a good granddaughter,

137
00:08:09.873 --> 00:08:13.076
You want me to be a cook for your grandpa?

138
00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:16.179
I can't do that,

139
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.949
I have a problem with my knees,

140
00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:23.119
I'll have bloody stool from cooking for your grandpa,

141
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.824
Your knees are stupid,

142
00:08:27.824 --> 00:08:30.693
Goodness,

143
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.998
You talk so mean for a little child,

144
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.703
Stop, that's enough,

145
00:08:42.238 --> 00:08:45.642
Is it okay for you to drink?

146
00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:47.544
This will help me sleep better, It's okay,

147
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.746
Why? Can't you sleep these days?

148
00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:52.749
You should sleep now to take care of your patients tomorrow,

149
00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:54.651
I have a lot on my mind,

150
00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:57.787
I feel so bad after hearing the story of my mother-in-law's life,

151
00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.355
That's right,

152
00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:04.761
I thought she luckily became rich from real estate speculation,

153
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.629
She's a poor woman,

154
00:09:07.997 --> 00:09:09.966
Treat her well when you go there,

155
00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:14.337
It's not easy to raise someone else's child,

156
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:17.607
She had decided to accept Han Gyul,

157
00:09:17.607 --> 00:09:19.108
Be thankful,

158
00:09:19.108 --> 00:09:20.143
That's why,,,

159
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.012
I'm going to try to find that person,

160
00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:25.148
That person?

161
00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:28.351
Do you mean Yeon Ju's brother whom Mrs, Yang abandoned,,,

162
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:30.653
46 years ago?

163
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.255
Yes,

164
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.224
When he went missing, they searched everywhere,,,

165
00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:36.759
because his father was a local worthy,

166
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.862
I think he was adopted overseas,,,

167
00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:41.864
because they couldn't find him,

168
00:09:41.864 --> 00:09:43.866
I don't think that's right,

169
00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:47.136
Who would adopt a 5 or 6-year-old child?

170
00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:49.505
It will be more painful if you don't find anything,,,

171
00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:52.008
after having high expectations,

172
00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.843
Just leave it there,

173
00:09:54.143 --> 00:09:56.746
I think my mother-in-law will find peace again,,,

174
00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:58.548
once I help her meet him,

175
00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:01.017
I'll try finding him,

176
00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:03.152
You punk,

177
00:10:03.453 --> 00:10:04.520
Anyway,

178
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.390
you have a big heart because you take after me,

179
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:11.127
Fine, Do your best to find the guy,

180
00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:13.262
Who knows?

181
00:10:14.263 --> 00:10:15.832
You can't see what's right under your nose,

182
00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:17.767
He might be closer to us than you think,

183
00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:23.106
A reunion of a mother and a son after half a century,

184
00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.042
My gosh, that would be incredible,

185
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.983
(Hwa Young Dance Academy)

186
00:10:46.763 --> 00:10:48.498
- I didn't know you were here, - Yes,

187
00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.502
I looked for you everywhere when I couldn't find you in the morning,

188
00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:54.270
Why are you here so early in the morning?

189
00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:56.773
I got my act together,

190
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.375
I'm going back to my old self,

191
00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:01.778
What do you mean?

192
00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.613
You got your act together?

193
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.250
I haven't been myself because of Kevin and you,

194
00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:12.021
I used to have so many students, but lately, a lot of them have left,

195
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:13.723
I only have three left now,

196
00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:18.528
I'm going to start again with my morning Zumba class,

197
00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:20.897
I will go back to the old days,

198
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.399
"The old days"? What do you mean?

199
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.502
I always try my best to live a simple life,

200
00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:28.137
but I've been thinking too much lately,

201
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.874
That's why I had been played by that witch, Joo Ae Ri,

202
00:11:32.742 --> 00:11:36.112
From now on, I'll keep my eyes straight ahead and live diligently,

203
00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:39.615
That's a great idea,

204
00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:44.153
If you want to go back to the old days,

205
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:46.355
it means,,,

206
00:11:47.156 --> 00:11:48.891
I can sleep next to you, right?

207
00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.095
I said I'll try, but I didn't say I forgive you,

208
00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:55.531
If the floor is uncomfortable, we'll switch weekly,

209
00:12:16.252 --> 00:12:18.020
Mom still hasn't forgiven him,

210
00:12:18.254 --> 00:12:19.756
We should use some of our allowance,

211
00:12:20.757 --> 00:12:22.992
Do you want to set up a date for them?

212
00:12:33.236 --> 00:12:35.371
My gosh, why are you sighing?

213
00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:39.776
Your dad met up with the chairman and cleared up misunderstandings,

214
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.111
I know,

215
00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:45.915
Did Joo Ae Ri cause another problem?

216
00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:50.386
Manager Jung was going to reveal everything at the meeting,

217
00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:55.258
But she pretended that I pushed her and fell from the staircase,,,

218
00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:56.759
in front of everyone,

219
00:12:56.993 --> 00:12:58.761
What,,, What?

220
00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:01.864
My gosh, Dear me,

221
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.534
What,,, How could she do that to herself?

222
00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:08.337
Mom, no matter how much I think, I don't think I can beat her,

223
00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:09.839
What's even more frustrating is,,,

224
00:13:10.473 --> 00:13:12.842
that the chairman still trusts her,

225
00:13:13.242 --> 00:13:18.014
It wouldn't be hard for him to doubt her since he practically raised her,

226
00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:20.283
Goodness,

227
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.886
So what is Manager Jung going to do?

228
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.389
He's going to make the final decision,

229
00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:27.990
"Final decision"?

230
00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:29.759
What is that?

231
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:35.231
(Statement)

232
00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:42.572
Were you aware of this?

233
00:13:42.772 --> 00:13:45.041
Did you know what Ae Ri did to Lee Ru Ri while she worked here?

234
00:13:45.508 --> 00:13:47.043
I also looked into it thoroughly,

235
00:13:47.844 --> 00:13:50.613
Everyone, who sided with Lee Ru Ri, is a friend of Lee Ru Ri,

236
00:13:51.214 --> 00:13:54.150
It must be a minor problem due to the competition in the office,

237
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.254
You and I cannot give Ae Ri a pass because we both care for her,

238
00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:02.124
I'm not giving her a pass, I've checked the statement myself,

239
00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:06.495
It's a small problem which stemmed from the competition between them,

240
00:14:12.802 --> 00:14:14.904
Sir, Mr, Jung Tae Yang is here to see you,

241
00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:16.739
Show him in,

242
00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:24.480
What brings you here so early?

243
00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:27.483
I am here to get my answer,

244
00:14:33.723 --> 00:14:36.292
What did you say? He's going to cut his ties?

245
00:14:36.659 --> 00:14:37.994
That's what he said,

246
00:14:38.728 --> 00:14:41.364
If the chairman continues to believe Joo Ae Ri,

247
00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:45.134
he said he's going to live his life without a father,

248
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:46.836
That's ludicrous,

249
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.905
It took them so long to reunite,

250
00:14:49.338 --> 00:14:52.508
Besides, those aren't the ties he can easily cut,

251
00:14:52.775 --> 00:14:55.745
Reuniting after 30 years proves it's his fate to have a father,

252
00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.749
That's why I'm thinking of breaking up with him,

253
00:15:00.216 --> 00:15:03.619
Even if we do get married, would we be happy?

254
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.889
I'll cause him to make an enemy out of his father for his entire life,

255
00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:10.026
I'll end up blaming myself for ruining his future,

256
00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.795
Where is Joo Ae Ri?

257
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.630
You said she's in the hospital, right?

258
00:15:14.764 --> 00:15:15.865
Which hospital?

259
00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:18.634
Mom, what are you going to do?

260
00:15:18.968 --> 00:15:21.037
I'm not going to do anything,

261
00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:23.239
Instead of thinking about excuses to break up with him,

262
00:15:23.239 --> 00:15:25.541
you should visit her and put an end to this mess,

263
00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:28.644
Mom, how could I outsmart her?

264
00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:31.013
I'm scared to even see her face now,

265
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:35.217
Is this how much your love amount to?

266
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.753
Because of a few lies,

267
00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:40.122
you're going to give up on your love?

268
00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:45.261
Ru Ri, do you know why I held out,,,

269
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.363
for 34 years even though,,,

270
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.765
I wanted to divorce your dad every single day?

271
00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:53.769
I wanted to do my best for the love I had chosen,

272
00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:56.706
Since you chose Manager Jung,

273
00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:58.607
regardless of the result,

274
00:15:58.774 --> 00:16:01.344
you must do your best not to have any regrets later on,

275
00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:08.617
You want my answer to your question?

276
00:16:10.987 --> 00:16:13.889
Have you looked over what I gave you?

277
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:16.492
Of course,

278
00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:17.960
What is your conclusion?

279
00:16:20.763 --> 00:16:21.864
Please tell me,

280
00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:25.267
If you choose to believe Joo Ae Ri even after reading this,

281
00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:27.403
we have nothing more to talk about,

282
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.706
You are aware that,,,

283
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.010
Joo Ae Ri and Lee Ru Ri got off on the wrong foot, correct?

284
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:39.915
People are selfish, so they're bound to speak favorable of themselves,

285
00:16:41.117 --> 00:16:42.885
Just like you believe Lee Ru Ri,

286
00:16:43.719 --> 00:16:45.621
I believe my daughter,

287
00:16:46.455 --> 00:16:47.623
Do you mean that?

288
00:16:48.124 --> 00:16:49.725
Yes, I do,

289
00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:53.162
I understand,

290
00:16:55.164 --> 00:16:59.135
If you are not willing to change, I will have to make my choice,

291
00:17:05.975 --> 00:17:07.376
(Resignation Letter)

292
00:17:08.244 --> 00:17:10.513
I cannot stand here and watch,,,

293
00:17:11.414 --> 00:17:13.682
when a wicked woman tries to ruin my life and,,,

294
00:17:14.216 --> 00:17:15.484
the life of the woman I love,

295
00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.788
Once I resign from my position, everything will be over,

296
00:17:19.655 --> 00:17:20.856
So I will resign,

297
00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.228
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

298
00:17:26.562 --> 00:17:30.299
You will cut ties with me if I don't give my blessing?

299
00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:32.234
- Is that it? - No,

300
00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:35.204
What I am giving up is the chance to follow in your footstep,

301
00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:39.175
I will live as your son outside the company,

302
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.611
Stop right there,

303
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.780
The moment you leave this office,

304
00:17:45.347 --> 00:17:47.716
I am going to give up on you before you give up on me,

305
00:17:48.951 --> 00:17:51.787
You won't mind if I don't include you in my inheritance will, correct?

306
00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:54.757
Please stay healthy,

307
00:18:34.096 --> 00:18:36.165
Gosh, that feels so nice,

308
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.701
It feels nice,

309
00:18:39.935 --> 00:18:42.238
- Do you like this that much? - Isn't it obvious?

310
00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:47.776
I know you're not making much these days, What's the occasion?

311
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.513
Actually, I didn't pay for this,

312
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.983
Woo Joo and Eun Byul got me this coupon,,,

313
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:56.218
for the couples massage with money from their part-time jobs,

314
00:18:57.086 --> 00:18:58.687
Why did they do that?

315
00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:01.423
They want us to sleep together,

316
00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.927
They said they wanted a sibling or something like that,

317
00:19:06.162 --> 00:19:07.329
They are all nuts,

318
00:19:07.596 --> 00:19:09.165
Did they forget how old I am?

319
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.570
We will prepare the tea for you, please get some rest,

320
00:19:14.703 --> 00:19:15.771
Okay,

321
00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:18.207
Thank you,

322
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:20.009
That feels great,

323
00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:23.479
But I'm glad,

324
00:19:24.647 --> 00:19:27.249
We overcame this ordeal together,

325
00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:33.756
Actually, I even thought about doing something horrible,

326
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.724
Something horrible?

327
00:19:37.026 --> 00:19:38.694
Didn't Tae Yang tell you?

328
00:19:40.196 --> 00:19:44.099
I even went to Kevin's ward,

329
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:49.004
Why,,, Why did you go there?

330
00:19:49.805 --> 00:19:51.407
When Kevin got into the accident,

331
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:54.910
do you not remember the fight we had?

332
00:19:57.313 --> 00:19:58.547
So you want to end things now?

333
00:19:58.747 --> 00:20:00.015
Do we have another choice?

334
00:20:00.482 --> 00:20:03.185
She's going to torture me as long as I'm with you,

335
00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:06.255
I don't want that monstrous witch to torture me anymore,

336
00:20:06.255 --> 00:20:08.190
It's also what's best for the children,

337
00:20:08.724 --> 00:20:11.493
I can't live with you any longer,

338
00:20:14.196 --> 00:20:16.665
Why did you go there?

339
00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:20.002
Why did you go see someone unconscious with a respirator?

340
00:20:21.604 --> 00:20:23.205
I wasn't in my right mind,

341
00:20:24.073 --> 00:20:25.541
I thought that I'd have you back,,,

342
00:20:27.042 --> 00:20:29.411
if only Kevin disappeared,

343
00:20:29.411 --> 00:20:30.713
Disappear?

344
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.750
Does that mean you went there to take the respirator off?

345
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.185
I told you,

346
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.520
Just like you were out of your mind,

347
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.456
I was out of my mind as well,

348
00:20:40.456 --> 00:20:41.991
It all happened in the past, so,,,

349
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.993
How can you say that it happened in the past?

350
00:20:45.761 --> 00:20:46.996
You murderer,

351
00:21:04.747 --> 00:21:08.083
Myung Rang, did you do as I told? Did you find out?

352
00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:09.418
Of course,

353
00:21:09.418 --> 00:21:12.254
Joo Ae Ri is in Room 606 in Hankuk Hospital,

354
00:21:12.254 --> 00:21:13.689
All right, Thanks,

355
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:16.492
Ru Ri, are you headed there?

356
00:21:16.492 --> 00:21:18.227
What are you going to do?

357
00:21:18.594 --> 00:21:21.897
I'm going to get my revenge on her,

358
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.500
I'll repay her for what she did to me,

359
00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:39.915
I think Tae Yang is more immature than we thought,

360
00:21:41.016 --> 00:21:44.219
You already have a lot on your mind because of the Beijing branch,

361
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:45.988
He shouldn't upset you about things like this,

362
00:21:45.988 --> 00:21:47.289
I know,

363
00:21:48.023 --> 00:21:50.259
It seems like I can't lean on anyone,

364
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.456
We've overcome the crisis,

365
00:22:20.456 --> 00:22:23.025
The chairman will be arriving in 40 minutes,

366
00:22:53.756 --> 00:22:55.224
(VIP Room 606, Patient Joo Ae Ri)

367
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.836
(Recording)

368
00:23:39.802 --> 00:23:42.037
Seeing that you're standing on your feet,

369
00:23:42.037 --> 00:23:44.006
this must be another one of your little acts,

370
00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:46.475
Why are you here?

371
00:23:46.842 --> 00:23:48.343
I've come here to give you an advice,

372
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.313
You're too good to be working at SC, You should be an actress,

373
00:23:52.948 --> 00:23:56.452
I don't need your advice, Get out of my room now,

374
00:23:58.487 --> 00:24:00.756
Do you think I'd get out so easily?

375
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.992
You'd better answer my questions from this moment,

376
00:24:03.992 --> 00:24:04.993
Get out,

377
00:24:04.993 --> 00:24:07.162
I'm expecting someone, Get out right now,

378
00:24:07.162 --> 00:24:08.530
That's better,

379
00:24:09.131 --> 00:24:10.399
You're supposed to be sick,

380
00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:12.801
I'll take care of the guests,

381
00:24:26.648 --> 00:24:29.451
All right, I don't have time, so be quick,

382
00:24:29.985 --> 00:24:31.053
What do you want to know?

383
00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:34.256
Why are you doing this?

384
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.092
You've even hurt yourself,

385
00:24:37.092 --> 00:24:38.760
Why are you doing this?

386
00:24:40.963 --> 00:24:42.264
Hurt myself?

387
00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:46.702
I fell because you pushed me,

388
00:24:47.503 --> 00:24:48.971
If it weren't for Jung Tae Yang,

389
00:24:48.971 --> 00:24:51.006
you'd already have been arrested,

390
00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:55.477
Do you know why you're so stupid?

391
00:24:56.345 --> 00:24:59.515
You think this will make Tae Yang change his mind about you?

392
00:24:59.515 --> 00:25:00.916
No, it won't,

393
00:25:01.683 --> 00:25:04.520
This will make him lose even the slightest pity he had for you,

394
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.021
He'll just hate you more,

395
00:25:08.223 --> 00:25:09.424
Do you really think so?

396
00:25:10.492 --> 00:25:12.194
No one knows how this will end,

397
00:25:12.494 --> 00:25:13.996
All I know is that,,,

398
00:25:13.996 --> 00:25:16.532
whatever you do, you won't be able to win me,

399
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:18.734
Do you know why?

400
00:25:19.968 --> 00:25:23.438
Just like you said before, I made a show of myself,

401
00:25:26.842 --> 00:25:30.479
That's not something everyone can do,

402
00:25:31.513 --> 00:25:34.182
You need to plan it, do rehearsals,

403
00:25:34.182 --> 00:25:36.418
and gather audience to witness it just in time,

404
00:25:37.419 --> 00:25:38.654
Moreover,

405
00:25:39.054 --> 00:25:42.591
you need to have the nerve to risk your life and fall down the stairs,

406
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.562
Do you really think you'll be able to beat me?

407
00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:50.399
Let's just say Tae Yang chose you, just like you said,

408
00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:53.035
Do you think you'd be happy?

409
00:25:54.036 --> 00:25:56.305
You'll be living with a shell that you stole from someone else,

410
00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:58.040
Do you think you'll be happy?

411
00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.441
Are you saying,,,

412
00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:02.544
that you prefer love to everything else?

413
00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:06.915
If it's so precious to you,

414
00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:09.151
there's only one way to protect it,

415
00:26:10.485 --> 00:26:14.056
Make Jung Tae Yang cut his ties with my dad,

416
00:26:15.223 --> 00:26:18.026
I'm not interested in Chef Jung Tae Yang,

417
00:26:18.226 --> 00:26:20.295
I'm interested in the successor of SC Food and Beverage,

418
00:26:25.434 --> 00:26:26.501
(Manager Jung)

419
00:26:26.935 --> 00:26:28.203
Why is this here?

420
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:35.177
What is this? Were you recording this?

421
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:37.446
Give me my phone back, Give it back,

422
00:26:37.813 --> 00:26:39.014
Give it to me,

423
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.996
What are you doing, Lee Ru Ri?

424
00:26:54.663 --> 00:26:56.932
She was hurt because of you, and yet you come here to her room,,,

425
00:26:56.932 --> 00:26:58.433
and cause a fuss?

426
00:26:58.433 --> 00:26:59.501
It's not like that,

427
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:03.839
Dad, please get her out of here,

428
00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:06.074
If you hadn't been here in time,,,

429
00:27:06.408 --> 00:27:07.743
Come outside,

430
00:27:07.743 --> 00:27:10.045
Let me go, Chairman Kevin, I just need a minute,

431
00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:11.446
Please hear me out,

432
00:27:11.446 --> 00:27:14.549
I just need a moment, Please listen to this,

433
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:16.551
Please get her out of here, Please,

434
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:17.953
Let's go,

435
00:27:18.687 --> 00:27:22.290
That's not something everyone can do,

436
00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:26.495
You need to plan it, do rehearsals,

437
00:27:26.495 --> 00:27:28.797
and gather audience to witness it just in time,

438
00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:33.201
Please listen to this, Everything is in here,

439
00:27:36.705 --> 00:27:38.507
- Let's go outside, - Wait,

440
00:27:40.709 --> 00:27:41.943
Give it to me,

441
00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:43.979
Sir,

442
00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:45.747
You don't need to hear that,

443
00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:47.416
It's just about our fight,

444
00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.684
Give it to me,

445
00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:01.496
Moreover,

446
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.500
you need to have the nerve to risk your life and fall down the stairs,

447
00:28:07.169 --> 00:28:08.970
Do you really think you'll be able to beat me?

448
00:28:29.991 --> 00:28:31.660
Can you reach Ru Ri?

449
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.862
Do you know where she is?

450
00:28:33.862 --> 00:28:35.764
She went to meet Joo Ae Ri,

451
00:28:35.764 --> 00:28:37.666
She asked me to find her hospital room,

452
00:28:38.266 --> 00:28:39.434
What?

453
00:28:41.503 --> 00:28:45.006
Make Jung Tae Yang cut his ties with my dad,

454
00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:48.643
I'm not interested in Chef Jung Tae Yang,

455
00:28:48.744 --> 00:28:50.779
I'm interested in the successor of SC Food and Beverage,

456
00:29:02.057 --> 00:29:03.425
You can go now,

457
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.756
- Sir, it's,,, - You should leave too,

458
00:29:45.433 --> 00:29:47.002
Is this the truth?

459
00:29:48.003 --> 00:29:51.506
Have you been lying to me all along?

460
00:29:53.675 --> 00:29:54.910
Answer me,

461
00:29:55.911 --> 00:29:57.345
Why did you do this to me?

462
00:30:00.248 --> 00:30:01.750
Answer me,

463
00:30:02.751 --> 00:30:05.821
I trusted you until the end, Why did you do this?

464
00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:09.925
Don't you know,,,

465
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.994
why I did this?

466
00:30:14.996 --> 00:30:17.766
Yes, I committed everything,

467
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.336
First, I tried to throw Jung Tae Yang out of the company,

468
00:30:22.504 --> 00:30:26.208
After people found out that he was your son, I tried to seduce him,

469
00:30:27.342 --> 00:30:28.743
Don't you still understand,,,

470
00:30:29.978 --> 00:30:31.446
why I did this?

471
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:34.916
It's because of you,

472
00:30:36.084 --> 00:30:38.486
You're the one who made me like this,

473
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:42.490
Even if we're not related by blood, I was raised as your daughter,

474
00:30:43.325 --> 00:30:46.194
You completely ignored me the moment you found out about Tae Yang,

475
00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:48.697
It turned out that he was your son,

476
00:30:48.697 --> 00:30:50.999
It was only a matter of time that I would be forgotten,

477
00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:54.603
- Ae Ri, - I did it,,,

478
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.505
because I was afraid that I would lose you,,,

479
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.175
and your love forever,

480
00:31:01.743 --> 00:31:03.144
I didn't want to be in pain,,,

481
00:31:04.212 --> 00:31:07.315
for the rest of my life and die alone just like my mom,

482
00:31:09.084 --> 00:31:11.052
Is it still my fault?

483
00:31:12.454 --> 00:31:14.256
Do you still think that I'm bad?

484
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.659
You're the one who made me like this,

485
00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:19.895
You made me become like this,

486
00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:25.467
I did this because of you,

487
00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:48.490
Ru Ri,

488
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.271
I told you to stay still,

489
00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:09.110
What happened?

490
00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:12.881
It's all over,

491
00:32:16.551 --> 00:32:18.186
The chairman will know now,

492
00:32:18.954 --> 00:32:20.021
He will know about everything,

493
00:32:41.242 --> 00:32:42.811
Oh, my,

494
00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:45.080
Gosh,

495
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.515
Are you beating the crab,,,

496
00:32:47.515 --> 00:32:50.485
or trying to cook it?

497
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.721
Why are you so cross early in the morning?

498
00:32:52.721 --> 00:32:55.090
Do you remember when I told you to make gejang?

499
00:32:55.256 --> 00:32:57.425
We won't be able to eat it today if you make this now,

500
00:32:57.492 --> 00:33:00.462
I don't have time to make gejang,

501
00:33:00.662 --> 00:33:02.564
I cleaned the entire house,,,

502
00:33:02.564 --> 00:33:04.432
and unpacked everything,

503
00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:06.401
When I lie down at night,

504
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:08.937
my legs would swell,

505
00:33:09.437 --> 00:33:11.740
Who are you trying to scam?

506
00:33:12.007 --> 00:33:15.410
Your whole body is swollen,

507
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.746
Is that why you're so cross?

508
00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:19.748
Don't you read the papers?

509
00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:23.418
There will be laws made to help maids make unions,

510
00:33:23.651 --> 00:33:27.756
If you don't guarantee my right to work and overwork me,

511
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:29.224
I might go on strike,

512
00:33:30.892 --> 00:33:32.494
I can't believe this,

513
00:33:33.061 --> 00:33:35.663
You don't know how lucky you are,

514
00:33:35.663 --> 00:33:37.966
You're talking nonsense,

515
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.101
The lady who used to work here,,,

516
00:33:40.235 --> 00:33:43.905
calls me day and night, She says that she's suffering,,,

517
00:33:43.905 --> 00:33:45.940
from frostbite on her hands from digging cockles in Beolgyo,

518
00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.410
She wants to work here again,

519
00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.678
So just quit, Take those gloves off,

520
00:33:50.678 --> 00:33:51.813
Get out,

521
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.718
I think you're having a problem with your hearing from getting old,

522
00:33:56.918 --> 00:33:59.020
When did I say that I was going on a strike?

523
00:33:59.254 --> 00:34:02.390
I brought up a possibility that I might go on a strike,

524
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:05.493
There were only two people living in this house,

525
00:34:05.493 --> 00:34:07.562
I just wanted you to appreciate that work has suddenly doubled for me,,,

526
00:34:07.562 --> 00:34:11.266
from two more people coming to this house,

527
00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:15.203
That's why I brought 1,000 dollars to give you,

528
00:34:15.503 --> 00:34:18.840
What else does Dr, Lee like besides gejang?

529
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.377
Does he like everything that has crabs?

530
00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:24.679
I'll do steamed crabs, crab soup, and crab rice,

531
00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.282
Are you serious? Crab rice?

532
00:34:27.415 --> 00:34:28.450
Gosh,

533
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.186
Be careful what you say,

534
00:34:31.853 --> 00:34:34.789
My precious son-in-law will come in the evening,

535
00:34:35.123 --> 00:34:37.125
Just make some delicious gejang,

536
00:34:37.225 --> 00:34:38.726
Don't add any sesame oil,

537
00:34:38.793 --> 00:34:41.796
- Okay, - Sesame oil doesn't go well,

538
00:34:41.896 --> 00:34:43.398
- Yes, - Yeon Ju?

539
00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:45.667
Yeon Ju,

540
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.646
Oh, my,

541
00:34:58.646 --> 00:35:03.151
You're like a fairy,,,

542
00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:05.687
on earth,

543
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:10.458
You look romantic and fantastic,

544
00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:11.893
You look so pretty,

545
00:35:12.127 --> 00:35:14.395
It's been awhile, Let's do it,

546
00:35:14.896 --> 00:35:16.531
Whose daughter are you?

547
00:35:16.831 --> 00:35:18.399
I'm your daughter,

548
00:35:20.702 --> 00:35:24.939
Please live happily this time without making a mistake, okay?

549
00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:27.775
Don't worry,

550
00:35:28.276 --> 00:35:30.411
I promise you,

551
00:35:30.612 --> 00:35:34.649
I'm going to make you laugh for the rest of your life,

552
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.319
You're really extraordinary,

553
00:35:38.453 --> 00:35:40.722
You divorced,,,

554
00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:43.124
and remarried within a year,

555
00:35:43.992 --> 00:35:45.126
That's not all,

556
00:35:45.293 --> 00:35:49.430
I'm probably the only person who has been through so much with someone,

557
00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:53.001
Engagement, marriage, separation, divorce, and remarriage,

558
00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:56.604
It's obvious that So Won is eternally my love,

559
00:35:58.206 --> 00:36:01.976
You won't be able to separate from So Won,

560
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:04.646
Wear your coat and get ready,

561
00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:14.856
Your aunt is the major reason why you could get back with each other,

562
00:36:14.956 --> 00:36:16.457
You must always thank her,

563
00:36:17.125 --> 00:36:18.359
Thank you,

564
00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:20.395
Please stay here for a long time,

565
00:36:20.495 --> 00:36:21.663
That's okay,

566
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:25.700
Your daughter wants me to be your father's cook,

567
00:36:26.834 --> 00:36:28.603
Grandma, that's a secret,

568
00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:34.375
Grandpa, please don't always eat ramyeon because I'm not here,

569
00:36:34.642 --> 00:36:37.245
Please take a bath when you have time,

570
00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:38.913
You smell like a widower,

571
00:36:39.514 --> 00:36:42.050
Don't drink alone and sleep,

572
00:36:42.183 --> 00:36:43.751
People say that you will get Bell's palsy,

573
00:36:44.085 --> 00:36:47.722
Don't cry alone because you miss me,

574
00:36:47.889 --> 00:36:50.625
- And,,, - Okay, I get it,

575
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:52.527
You're nagging me so much when you're about to leave,

576
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:55.930
If you're that worried, live with me here,,,

577
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:57.131
instead of leaving with your dad,

578
00:36:58.499 --> 00:36:59.601
No,

579
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.772
Bow before it's too late,

580
00:37:05.106 --> 00:37:07.976
If not, you'll really have to live with grandpa here,

581
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:16.951
Mom and Dad, I will live happily,

582
00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:18.753
Please be healthy,

583
00:37:31.065 --> 00:37:33.901
Oh, my goodness,

584
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.112
Kim Dong Il,

585
00:37:44.145 --> 00:37:45.480
(Kim Dong Il, Deposit 40,000 dollars)

586
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:48.683
The director transferred properly,

587
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.590
There was heavy snow early this morning,

588
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.226
I heard that you will live a happy life,,,

589
00:37:58.226 --> 00:38:00.161
if heavy snow falls on your wedding day,

590
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:03.164
We will gladly celebrate the remarriage,,,

591
00:38:03.164 --> 00:38:05.066
of Lee So Won and Ha Yeon Ju,,,

592
00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:08.770
who went a long way to meet again,

593
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.472
Please greet the adults of both families,

594
00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:25.853
The mothers of both families will light a candle,,,

595
00:38:25.853 --> 00:38:28.756
to wish a bright future for you,

596
00:38:50.278 --> 00:38:53.314
Not only you but also the family members,,,

597
00:38:53.314 --> 00:38:56.918
went through a hard time because of the divorce,

598
00:38:57.585 --> 00:39:00.588
I asked you to write a letter,,,

599
00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:03.224
to promise that you will never separate again,

600
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:05.526
Please read it if you're ready,

601
00:39:13.568 --> 00:39:15.570
I won't quarrel with you,

602
00:39:16.371 --> 00:39:19.474
If a quarrel is inevitable, I will let you win,

603
00:39:20.975 --> 00:39:24.779
If something unforgivable happens, please forgive me three times,

604
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.416
I will forgive you four times,

605
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.719
I will always smile when I'm next to you,

606
00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:34.422
I will always respect you like this,

607
00:39:34.756 --> 00:39:36.624
I will trust you,

608
00:39:36.991 --> 00:39:39.293
I will always cherish you,

609
00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:42.563
We will live as partners taking the same path,

610
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.500
as parents, and as lovers,

611
00:39:51.005 --> 00:39:52.974
Let's get divorced,

612
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.512
- I love you, - And,,,

613
00:39:57.745 --> 00:40:00.281
- no matter what hardship will come, - no matter what hardship will come,

614
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:02.450
- we will not give up each other,,, - we will not give up each other,,,

615
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.318
- and try hard until the end, - and try hard until the end,

616
00:40:04.452 --> 00:40:06.721
- Even if we fail, - Even if we fail,

617
00:40:06.721 --> 00:40:08.523
- we will rely on each other,,, - we will rely on each other,,,

618
00:40:08.523 --> 00:40:10.458
- with the everlasting love, - with the everlasting love,

619
00:40:10.458 --> 00:40:12.026
- We will love,,, - We will love,,,

620
00:40:12.026 --> 00:40:14.128
- each other for ever, - each other for ever,

621
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:54.602
Su Mi,

622
00:41:00.741 --> 00:41:01.976
How did it go?

623
00:41:04.278 --> 00:41:05.980
(Kim Dong Il, 40,000 dollars)

624
00:41:07.081 --> 00:41:08.249
Make sure to keep it,

625
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.585
I'll be out in a month,

626
00:41:10.818 --> 00:41:13.588
How? You still have time left,

627
00:41:13.621 --> 00:41:15.223
I applied for parole,

628
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.526
I'll be able to leave this time,

629
00:41:19.794 --> 00:41:21.762
So I need that money,

630
00:41:21.762 --> 00:41:24.265
If you ever use that money, I won't let you get away with it,

631
00:41:24.265 --> 00:41:27.001
Don't worry, Han Gyul isn't even around,

632
00:41:27.935 --> 00:41:30.938
As soon as you get out of here, your life will bloom,

633
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.242
Have you heard about Han Gyul?

634
00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:37.211
Are you crazy? Why would you be interested after abandoning her?

635
00:41:37.812 --> 00:41:39.180
Forget about her,

636
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.182
She's probably doing well with the rich family,

637
00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:43.951
Remember to secure that money,

638
00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:46.254
As soon as I leave,

639
00:41:47.221 --> 00:41:49.457
I'm going to live like a human being,

640
00:41:54.662 --> 00:41:56.631
I'm hungry, Grandpa,

641
00:41:56.631 --> 00:41:58.833
When do we get to eat?

642
00:41:58.900 --> 00:41:59.901
Soon,

643
00:42:00.701 --> 00:42:01.702
Well,,,

644
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:06.107
Why don't you make a speech to celebrate their marriage?

645
00:42:06.974 --> 00:42:11.479
I actually wrote a letter,

646
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.586
I heard the happiest day of life,,,

647
00:42:18.586 --> 00:42:22.223
is when my child gets married,

648
00:42:22.723 --> 00:42:25.626
Even though I was against it,

649
00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:29.664
all my daughter wanted was Lee So Won,

650
00:42:30.398 --> 00:42:33.935
So I'm going to test you,,,

651
00:42:34.435 --> 00:42:37.004
for the last time,

652
00:42:37.605 --> 00:42:40.708
You have to answer it right to have my daughter,

653
00:42:40.708 --> 00:42:44.512
so listen carefully and answer,

654
00:42:44.512 --> 00:42:45.580
Mom,

655
00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:51.619
Just like how you worship Lord at church,,,

656
00:42:51.619 --> 00:42:54.455
and follow Buddha at temple,

657
00:42:54.956 --> 00:42:58.526
tell me whom you must trust and follow,,,

658
00:42:58.526 --> 00:43:02.396
when a couple in love,,,

659
00:43:02.897 --> 00:43:04.398
is married,

660
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:06.934
Whom?

661
00:43:07.335 --> 00:43:09.971
What is it? What is it? I'm curious,

662
00:43:09.971 --> 00:43:12.840
Tell me the answer, Tell me,

663
00:43:14.542 --> 00:43:16.277
Let's eat first,

664
00:43:16.277 --> 00:43:18.245
I'm hungry, Hat Granny,

665
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.048
Be quiet, you little girl,

666
00:43:21.048 --> 00:43:24.352
She's so hasty just like her grandfather,

667
00:43:26.454 --> 00:43:27.722
That is,,,

668
00:43:28.623 --> 00:43:33.494
The one that the couple must trust and follow is,,,

669
00:43:34.395 --> 00:43:36.731
honey,

670
00:43:41.969 --> 00:43:45.272
Although I answered it for you,

671
00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:48.275
what I'm asking you is,,,

672
00:43:48.275 --> 00:43:50.611
that you should serve your sweetheart,

673
00:43:50.611 --> 00:43:55.516
and I wish you to live happily ever after,

674
00:43:56.183 --> 00:43:58.419
- Yes, I'll keep that in mind, - Yes, I'll keep that in mind,

675
00:44:02.957 --> 00:44:05.126
You should make a speech too,

676
00:44:05.126 --> 00:44:07.161
You've been practicing,

677
00:44:07.294 --> 00:44:09.063
What I practiced?

678
00:44:10.031 --> 00:44:11.332
Shall I?

679
00:44:17.371 --> 00:44:18.472
First of all,

680
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.111
for allowing Han Gyul and So Won,

681
00:44:24.812 --> 00:44:28.816
I'm very thankful, grateful,

682
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:32.520
and I love you,

683
00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:36.857
Goodness, I don't want a widower,

684
00:44:42.063 --> 00:44:44.231
I'm just joking,

685
00:44:45.066 --> 00:44:46.200
Now that,,,

686
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.870
I've graduated marriage, I've learned a lot,

687
00:44:52.206 --> 00:44:55.142
The more the husband loves,

688
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.245
the less the wife asks,

689
00:44:59.246 --> 00:45:01.549
The more the wife loves,

690
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:05.219
the less the husband is exhausted,

691
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.122
In this lonely world,

692
00:45:08.723 --> 00:45:10.624
it's a bless,,,

693
00:45:11.358 --> 00:45:12.793
to have a lover,

694
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:16.430
You should be nice to another when you have them, Over,

695
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:27.374
Then now, Aunt who is the oldest person in here,,,

696
00:45:27.374 --> 00:45:29.410
and who had a happy marriage,,,

697
00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:32.546
will propose a toast,

698
00:45:32.546 --> 00:45:33.581
Aunt,

699
00:45:36.851 --> 00:45:40.187
There's only one thing I can say,,,

700
00:45:40.187 --> 00:45:41.756
on this gracious day,

701
00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:45.659
This is a miracle, Everyone's a miracle,

702
00:45:46.026 --> 00:45:48.395
Oh, my goodness,

703
00:45:48.929 --> 00:45:51.599
- Oh, my goodness, - Oh, my goodness,

704
00:46:05.412 --> 00:46:08.182
It's such a relief that Chairman Kevin finally realized,,,

705
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:09.850
that Joo Ae Ri put on a show,

706
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.952
Ru Ri's also very amazing,

707
00:46:11.952 --> 00:46:15.022
How could she think of visiting such a scary woman?

708
00:46:15.623 --> 00:46:18.559
I know, She'll be fine from now on,

709
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.297
By the way, I'm going to meet your father soon,

710
00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:26.834
Because you said your father likes a humorous person,

711
00:46:26.834 --> 00:46:28.869
I've been practicing jokes,

712
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.273
Really? Then show me how funny it is,

713
00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.543
Remember, My father's very sophisticated,

714
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.312
Are you going to hit me again?

715
00:46:38.312 --> 00:46:40.047
No,

716
00:46:40.281 --> 00:46:42.850
There's no place to hit you on your body,

717
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.019
Hurry up, Try me,

718
00:46:45.019 --> 00:46:46.120
Then,,,

719
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.123
- it'll give a nonsense quiz, - Okay,

720
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.393
US currency's dollar, Japanese currency's Yen,

721
00:46:52.393 --> 00:46:54.895
Then what would be Australian currency?

722
00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:57.431
Well,,, Isn't it Australian dollar?

723
00:46:57.431 --> 00:47:00.267
No, It's a pocket,

724
00:47:12.813 --> 00:47:14.782
You always hit me,

725
00:47:14.782 --> 00:47:16.183
Do some more,

726
00:47:16.183 --> 00:47:17.685
- I have no more, - Do some more,

727
00:47:17.685 --> 00:47:18.919
I'm not going to do it,

728
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:19.954
Kim Sung Tan!

729
00:47:25.993 --> 00:47:27.795
You made me like this,

730
00:47:27.795 --> 00:47:30.164
You turned me into this,

731
00:47:31.065 --> 00:47:33.334
I won't let my life and life of the one I love,,,

732
00:47:33.334 --> 00:47:36.170
get ruined that wicked woman,,,

733
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:37.471
any longer,

734
00:47:37.605 --> 00:47:39.740
All this will end when I quit this company,

735
00:47:40.374 --> 00:47:41.642
so I'll leave,

736
00:47:54.455 --> 00:47:57.858
(Traditional Italian restaurant, Neapolitan Kitchen's hiring a cook,)

737
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:06.300
(Father)

738
00:48:31.392 --> 00:48:34.061
Lee Ru Ri, It took me a while to call you,

739
00:48:34.762 --> 00:48:36.330
It's all right, sir,

740
00:48:37.431 --> 00:48:38.999
I called you to ask for a favor,

741
00:48:39.934 --> 00:48:42.269
It seems Tae Yang's disappointed in me,

742
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.605
Help me meet him,

743
00:48:45.973 --> 00:48:48.642
The faster, the better, It'd be great if I could meet him today,

744
00:48:50.544 --> 00:48:52.313
Okay, I'll be waiting,

745
00:49:00.087 --> 00:49:01.855
You should get going, sir,

746
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:04.391
Okay,

747
00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:05.893
About Ae Ri,,,

748
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.262
What are you going to do about her?

749
00:49:08.262 --> 00:49:11.665
Stay away from that problem,

750
00:49:31.752 --> 00:49:33.821
Why did you want to meet here? It's uncomfortable,

751
00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:35.689
How so?

752
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.791
I love this place,

753
00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:40.160
This is the place,,,

754
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.930
where I became a career woman from a jobless person,

755
00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:47.001
It's a precious place I'll never forget,

756
00:49:49.436 --> 00:49:51.372
How did the remarriage go?

757
00:49:51.605 --> 00:49:53.374
I realized it today,,,

758
00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.476
how important a family is,

759
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.079
When I'm happy or sad,

760
00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:02.449
my family is the one who empathizes with me,

761
00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:04.918
That's true,

762
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:08.589
That's probably why people all get married and have children,

763
00:50:09.289 --> 00:50:10.457
Right?

764
00:50:17.164 --> 00:50:20.768
That's why you can't turn your back on,,,

765
00:50:21.335 --> 00:50:23.470
your precious family members,

766
00:50:25.005 --> 00:50:27.141
- Ru Ri, - If I tell you that it's my wish,

767
00:50:28.208 --> 00:50:30.411
will you make up with the chairman?

768
00:50:39.353 --> 00:50:40.521
Why are you here?

769
00:50:41.822 --> 00:50:44.224
Are you here to tell me about Jung Tae Yang's marriage?

770
00:50:45.726 --> 00:50:48.128
Now that the bad bully is gone,

771
00:50:49.063 --> 00:50:51.565
the only thing left is for them to get married,

772
00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:53.934
Dad,

773
00:50:54.835 --> 00:50:57.204
you wanted to have many people around you,

774
00:50:58.105 --> 00:51:00.340
You should get them married, have children,

775
00:51:00.841 --> 00:51:02.309
and hurry up with the succession,

776
00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:05.546
What are you planning to do in the future?

777
00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:09.416
Why do you ask me that?

778
00:51:10.951 --> 00:51:13.353
Doesn't everything depend on your decision?

779
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:23.831
I've been thinking about this for a few days, but I still don't know,

780
00:51:26.166 --> 00:51:28.602
If I was lacking and made you feel lonely,

781
00:51:29.369 --> 00:51:30.504
I'm sorry,

782
00:51:31.572 --> 00:51:35.976
But that's no excuse for the wrongdoings that you've done,

783
00:51:36.243 --> 00:51:37.411
So what?

784
00:51:38.045 --> 00:51:39.813
You want me to get lost to America?

785
00:51:40.814 --> 00:51:42.749
Now that your real son is here,

786
00:51:42.749 --> 00:51:46.320
you want to get rid of your adopted daughter, Isn't that the truth?

787
00:51:49.723 --> 00:51:51.391
The only thing I want from you,,,

788
00:51:52.025 --> 00:51:53.994
is to live truthfully like a human,

789
00:51:54.628 --> 00:51:56.130
Neither hurting others,,,

790
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.931
nor lying to others,

791
00:51:58.665 --> 00:52:00.000
If you can keep these promises,

792
00:52:00.934 --> 00:52:04.471
I'll support you whatever you do wherever you want,

793
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:11.912
You should make a decision on your own,

794
00:52:12.412 --> 00:52:13.780
What do you want to do?

795
00:52:14.148 --> 00:52:15.649
What are you going to do in the future?

796
00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:18.852
I'll be back,

797
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:23.190
So you're blaming me until the end!

798
00:52:29.997 --> 00:52:31.832
There's only one thing I want,

799
00:52:33.333 --> 00:52:36.370
I want to be a useful daughter to you,

800
00:52:37.771 --> 00:52:39.540
So please forgive me once more,

801
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:42.543
and let me stay next to you,

802
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.182
I'm sorry,

803
00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:50.017
But that won't be possible,

804
00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:53.353
If you stay next to me, I'll lose two people,

805
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:56.523
You know who they are,

806
00:52:58.125 --> 00:52:59.560
Think carefully,,,

807
00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.563
and then tell me how you plan to live from now on,

808
00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:36.496
Chairman Kevin, I'm waiting for you at the restaurant with Tae Yang,

809
00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:48.775
I'll go by myself, You should stay here and comfort Ae Ri,

810
00:53:58.151 --> 00:53:59.353
What did he say?

811
00:54:00.721 --> 00:54:02.956
I think he wants me to leave,

812
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:05.392
Why did you ruin things like this?

813
00:54:06.793 --> 00:54:07.894
What?

814
00:54:08.061 --> 00:54:10.264
Who do you think is to blame for all this?

815
00:54:11.932 --> 00:54:13.066
I don't know now,

816
00:54:13.567 --> 00:54:15.769
It's getting so pathetic, Let's just end everything here,

817
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.139
I'll just go to America and spend money,

818
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.375
I'll sell all the stocks that Mom left me,

819
00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:25.579
I can't let you go like this,

820
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.180
What?

821
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:29.149
What will you do then?

822
00:54:29.316 --> 00:54:31.652
Do you want me to put up a show again?

823
00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:35.255
You should if you need to, so as to change his mind,

824
00:54:35.255 --> 00:54:36.590
Get over it,

825
00:54:37.891 --> 00:54:40.894
Whatever I do, even if I do something crazy,

826
00:54:41.628 --> 00:54:43.330
Dad won't change his mind,

827
00:54:44.931 --> 00:54:47.601
I learned the hard way that there's nothing important than blood,

828
00:54:51.171 --> 00:54:53.240
Did you forget how your mother died?

829
00:54:54.341 --> 00:54:56.777
Why does Jung Tae Yang have to be the successor to SC Food?

830
00:54:57.611 --> 00:54:58.912
It's always the same pattern,

831
00:54:59.513 --> 00:55:03.083
We do all the hard work, and they get all the good inheritance,

832
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:05.085
We're not bad,

833
00:55:05.085 --> 00:55:07.754
We're just trying to get the fair share we deserve!

834
00:55:07.754 --> 00:55:09.456
This is justice,

835
00:55:16.163 --> 00:55:17.397
What should I do then?

836
00:55:18.332 --> 00:55:21.001
I need to be next to him to be able to take or get something,

837
00:55:21.702 --> 00:55:23.704
But there's no way I can stay next to him,

838
00:55:27.341 --> 00:55:28.542
I told you before,,,

839
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:33.046
about how your mother died,

840
00:55:33.814 --> 00:55:34.915
Keep that in mind,

841
00:55:38.185 --> 00:55:41.521
We'll aim for Kevin's weakness,

842
00:55:52.833 --> 00:55:54.668
We'll be arriving at the airport soon,

843
00:55:56.002 --> 00:55:58.872
Why do you keep knitting that?

844
00:55:59.206 --> 00:56:01.775
There's nothing much to do for your children at this age,

845
00:56:02.709 --> 00:56:05.679
The least I can do is to make baby hats for them,

846
00:56:05.812 --> 00:56:08.181
Gosh, children,

847
00:56:08.515 --> 00:56:11.952
We'll always be worried about them as long as we live,

848
00:56:12.219 --> 00:56:14.421
That's why children owe us,

849
00:56:16.022 --> 00:56:19.393
You should think about this again,

850
00:56:19.893 --> 00:56:21.795
How can you go to Sudan at your age?

851
00:56:22.729 --> 00:56:25.699
Even foxes go back to their hometowns when they die,

852
00:56:25.999 --> 00:56:28.568
You should live in Korea with me,

853
00:56:28.568 --> 00:56:30.270
You're the one who needs to have a life,

854
00:56:30.771 --> 00:56:33.440
I'm going to Sudan to cook for my son,

855
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.243
What about me? My life is good enough as it is,

856
00:56:37.244 --> 00:56:38.912
You must be kidding me,

857
00:56:40.313 --> 00:56:42.849
Don't you know that only couples are there for each other,,,

858
00:56:43.517 --> 00:56:45.519
as they get older and older?

859
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.022
After my husband left,

860
00:56:49.856 --> 00:56:52.659
my house seems empty,

861
00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:56.797
Do your best when there still is someone you love,

862
00:56:58.064 --> 00:56:59.399
I want to,

863
00:57:00.267 --> 00:57:01.935
but Young Hye doesn't want me,

864
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:05.639
If she really hated you, she'd have gotten a divorce,

865
00:57:06.773 --> 00:57:09.976
Please change your personality, and don't let her go,

866
00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.546
And don't forget the words "honey" and "darling",

867
00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:14.314
What do you mean?

868
00:57:14.314 --> 00:57:15.682
Don't you know that?

869
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.853
Saying "Honey" tells people that you think they're precious to you,

870
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:24.524
Saying "Darling" means that person is as valuable as your life,

871
00:57:25.292 --> 00:57:28.295
Only Young Hye can be your "honey" and "darling",

872
00:57:29.296 --> 00:57:32.332
Get her back before it's too late,

873
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.701
"Honey" and "darling"?

874
00:57:39.272 --> 00:57:40.640
"Honey" and "darling",

875
00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:58.091
What are you thinking about?

876
00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:00.393
When I ended things with you,,,

877
00:58:01.862 --> 00:58:03.763
and left with my father,

878
00:58:04.998 --> 00:58:07.334
I thought I'd never come back to your house,

879
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:11.872
But I'm here again,

880
00:58:12.439 --> 00:58:15.775
Yes, This still feels like a dream to me,

881
00:58:19.546 --> 00:58:20.981
It's all thanks to you,

882
00:58:21.681 --> 00:58:24.084
Thank you for never giving up and reaching out to me,

883
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:25.952
Thank you,,,

884
00:58:26.186 --> 00:58:28.021
for coming back to me in time,

885
00:58:30.223 --> 00:58:32.225
Han Gyul is asleep, I'll carry her,

886
00:58:35.362 --> 00:58:39.599
Is going on a drive instead of a proper trip all right for you?

887
00:58:41.568 --> 00:58:43.470
We can't go because of Han Gyul's kindergarten,

888
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:46.873
We barely got her in, She needs to go starting tomorrow,

889
00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:51.411
I'm sorry for making you become a mom so suddenly,

890
00:58:51.511 --> 00:58:53.013
I want to thank you,

891
00:58:54.047 --> 00:58:56.082
Just like your father told me,

892
00:58:56.182 --> 00:58:58.552
she's all grown up, so we don't need to wake up in the nights,

893
00:58:58.552 --> 00:58:59.853
And I didn't need to get a surgery,

894
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.122
What's more,

895
00:59:02.689 --> 00:59:05.592
she made me realize how much I love you,

896
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:17.771
What are you doing?

897
00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:21.207
Oh my goodness,

898
00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:23.476
My eyes are ruined,

899
00:59:34.721 --> 00:59:36.222
Oh, my,

900
00:59:36.723 --> 00:59:39.893
Why are you setting the table all of a sudden?

901
00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.896
Why do you say all of a sudden? It's called housekeeping,

902
00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:45.832
My precious son-in-law is coming home today,

903
00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:50.103
I prepared the best dinner there is,

904
00:59:51.838 --> 00:59:54.040
I was really surprised,

905
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.543
You're really good at cooking,

906
00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:01.815
I've worked at restaurants for 20 to 30 years,

907
01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:03.850
I'm sick of cooking,

908
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.019
That's why I stopped going into the kitchen,

909
01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.188
So basically this place is,,,

910
01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:10.457
training school for a maid,

911
01:00:10.457 --> 01:00:13.159
You're learning from me for free,

912
01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:15.762
You should pay me,

913
01:00:17.564 --> 01:00:19.165
Mom, We're here,

914
01:00:19.499 --> 01:00:20.834
Welcome,

915
01:00:23.336 --> 01:00:24.471
Goodness,

916
01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:30.610
Congratulations Congratulations

917
01:00:31.645 --> 01:00:34.314
I made flowers with one-dollar-bills,,,

918
01:00:34.314 --> 01:00:37.951
all night long,

919
01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:39.352
Welcome,

920
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.821
Goodness,

921
01:00:41.821 --> 01:00:45.225
It took you four months,,,

922
01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:48.294
to come home from work,

923
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:50.163
Yes, Mother,

924
01:00:51.264 --> 01:00:52.565
I'm back,

925
01:00:52.832 --> 01:00:55.335
From now on, I'll be home on time,

926
01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:57.370
Yes, sir,

927
01:00:58.271 --> 01:00:59.472
Come here,

928
01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:22.162
Young Hye is your only "honey" and "darling",

929
01:01:22.562 --> 01:01:24.431
Get her before it's too late,

930
01:01:27.834 --> 01:01:28.902
Goodness,

931
01:01:29.369 --> 01:01:32.639
Why would you stand there so quietly?

932
01:01:40.413 --> 01:01:43.149
Did your sister leave safely?

933
01:01:43.683 --> 01:01:44.751
Yes,

934
01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:46.853
What made you stay,,,

935
01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.222
and cook for me?

936
01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:51.791
I thought you'd feel lonely,

937
01:01:52.092 --> 01:01:54.728
Now that your beloved So Won and Han Gyul left,

938
01:01:54.728 --> 01:01:57.130
you really have to live alone from now on,

939
01:01:58.164 --> 01:01:59.999
I made some side dishes for you,

940
01:01:59.999 --> 01:02:01.434
Just cook rice later,

941
01:02:01.901 --> 01:02:03.670
Are you worried about me?

942
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.372
Of course I am,

943
01:02:06.372 --> 01:02:08.775
Women can live alone,

944
01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:11.311
but men can't do it at all,

945
01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:12.679
You're right,

946
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.449
Couples must live together,

947
01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:21.354
When I saw So Won and Yeon Ju sitting together,

948
01:02:21.755 --> 01:02:24.090
I felt like crying,

949
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.292
Right, They were beautiful,

950
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.729
Couples must stay together just like you said,

951
01:02:30.797 --> 01:02:31.831
How about,,,

952
01:02:32.599 --> 01:02:35.702
a love shot after a long time,,,

953
01:02:35.935 --> 01:02:38.705
to feel like we're on a date?

954
01:02:38.705 --> 01:02:42.142
Sure, It seems you've changed a lot,

955
01:02:42.142 --> 01:02:44.778
I was actually about to compliment you,

956
01:02:45.145 --> 01:02:46.179
Here,

957
01:02:57.457 --> 01:02:58.725
Here,

958
01:02:59.459 --> 01:03:01.394
I love you, Hong Young Hye,

959
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.062
Goodness,

960
01:03:03.429 --> 01:03:07.000
I'm happy that I still have a man who says that to me,

961
01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:10.470
I only have you in my life,

962
01:03:22.582 --> 01:03:25.552
Why won't you drink?

963
01:03:26.186 --> 01:03:27.587
Are you worried about getting drunk?

964
01:03:28.822 --> 01:03:30.390
Then you can stay here tonight,

965
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:33.760
Next to Shin Mo that you love,

966
01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:36.896
No thank you, I have to drive,

967
01:03:39.265 --> 01:03:42.368
What? Did you buy a car?

968
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:45.538
I don't have money for it,

969
01:03:45.872 --> 01:03:49.375
Then where did you get a car?

970
01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.813
I got one,

971
01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.349
What are you talking about?

972
01:03:56.449 --> 01:03:59.185
It's expensive, How can you just get it?

973
01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.121
The boss bought one for me,

974
01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:03.389
He said I'm working hard,

975
01:04:08.027 --> 01:04:09.629
You scared me,

976
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.566
Hong Young Hye, Are you that easy?

977
01:04:14.167 --> 01:04:16.369
Is that why you graduated marriage?

978
01:04:16.703 --> 01:04:17.971
Honey,

979
01:04:17.971 --> 01:04:19.973
Honey my foot,

980
01:04:19.973 --> 01:04:22.809
Are you stupid or are you nuts about money?

981
01:04:23.209 --> 01:04:26.412
Why would he buy a car for someone else's wife?

982
01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:29.949
He's doing that to get you,

983
01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:31.584
Didn't you notice it when you took it?

984
01:04:31.684 --> 01:04:34.220
Or did you just fall for it,,,

985
01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.289
even though you're aware?

986
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:40.059
You need to act like your age,

987
01:04:40.393 --> 01:04:44.063
Do you still want to act like a woman at that age?

988
01:04:45.732 --> 01:04:49.102
Lee Shin Mo, Is that the best you can do?

989
01:04:49.769 --> 01:04:51.938
I have to go to the factory in the other region occasionally,

990
01:04:51.938 --> 01:04:54.040
I have to train people,,,

991
01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.642
at other stores,

992
01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:58.111
He was being considerate and told me to use it like a company car,

993
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:00.580
What did you say? A gold digger,,,

994
01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.814
and acting like a woman?

995
01:05:02.081 --> 01:05:04.317
Are you going to keep talking shallow?

996
01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:05.919
What? Shallow?

997
01:05:06.686 --> 01:05:09.455
Is your boss,,,

998
01:05:09.455 --> 01:05:11.491
spending money to flirt with another man's wife,,,

999
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.294
because he's elegant and sophisticated?

1000
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.630
Which car did you get?

1001
01:05:17.764 --> 01:05:20.600
If he got you a company car to go to other stores and factory,

1002
01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.703
he should've gotten you at least a freight truck,

1003
01:05:23.937 --> 01:05:26.239
Did you get a truck?

1004
01:05:26.439 --> 01:05:29.275
No, you didn't, See?

1005
01:05:29.275 --> 01:05:32.512
I can smell it already from it,

1006
01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.380
Did you think you could hide it?

1007
01:05:34.914 --> 01:05:38.084
Goodness, The man who gives or the woman who takes,

1008
01:05:38.251 --> 01:05:39.852
It's so ugly, I can't stand it,

1009
01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:41.921
Return the car tomorrow,

1010
01:05:43.122 --> 01:05:44.891
My goodness,

1011
01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.560
What? You don't want to?

1012
01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:51.931
Do you want that car or the guy?

1013
01:05:52.632 --> 01:05:54.434
Why can't you return it?

1014
01:05:56.703 --> 01:06:00.840
I was out of my mind for a second because of the kids,

1015
01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:05.979
It's true that I'm not supposed to fix someone,

1016
01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:08.247
You haven't changed at all,

1017
01:06:08.247 --> 01:06:11.951
Lee Shin Mo, Keep living like this, and die,

1018
01:06:12.185 --> 01:06:13.219
What?

1019
01:06:13.753 --> 01:06:16.222
Hey, Hong Young Hye, Stop right there,

1020
01:06:16.522 --> 01:06:18.524
It's an order, Stop right there,

1021
01:06:28.101 --> 01:06:29.969
What are you doing? Let me go,

1022
01:06:30.837 --> 01:06:32.005
Come here,

1023
01:06:50.356 --> 01:06:52.625
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1024
01:06:52.892 --> 01:06:53.893
What's this?

1025
01:06:53.893 --> 01:06:56.329
I kept it even after your mom left,

1026
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:58.564
I want you to keep it,

1027
01:06:58.564 --> 01:07:00.666
- Han Gyul, - Yeon Ju,

1028
01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:02.201
You should call me Mom,

1029
01:07:02.668 --> 01:07:04.604
Mom! Why can't you say it?

1030
01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:08.274
Mom, Mom, Mom,

1031
01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.476
How dare you separate me and my dad?

1032
01:07:10.476 --> 01:07:12.612
Let's see if it goes your way,

1033
01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:14.814
This is a veterinary anesthetic,

1034
01:07:14.814 --> 01:07:16.582
Is it life threatening?

1035
01:07:16.582 --> 01:07:17.583
Maybe,

1036
01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:20.620
Do you think Joo Ae Ri did all that alone?

1037
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.622
Chairman Kevin might be in danger too,
