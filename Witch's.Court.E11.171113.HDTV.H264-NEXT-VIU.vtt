146
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.929
There's no time for you to feel this way.

147
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.230
I need to wake up at a time like this.

148
00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:21.409
Gosh. I better go home.

149
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.590
Did you call for a driver?

150
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:41.860
Yes.

151
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:53.939
Did they hire you for your looks?

152
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.870
Gosh. Sure.

153
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.909
Would you like?

154
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.319
That's how you molested him?

155
00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:09.250
No. No, no!

156
00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:11.659
You stroked his thigh multiple times...

157
00:10:11.659 --> 00:10:15.330
and breathed into his ear. You also hugged him.

158
00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:18.760
- It says so here. - Me?

159
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.059
His thigh? Why?

160
00:10:21.429 --> 00:10:22.529
Why?

161
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.340
I... Well...

162
00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:29.010
It says here that you told him you couldn't...

163
00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:32.840
control yourself. Don't you remember?

164
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.949
If I did, would I be here?

165
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.919
I would have sued him for false accusation.

166
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.449
Anyway, I didn't do it. Get me an NPA.

168

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.590
Gosh.

171
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.500
Let's do a cross-examination.

172
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.980
Well...

173
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.710
Everyone has different tastes.

174
00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:13.649
And then what happened?

175
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.949
Keep going.

176
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:15.949
Okay.

177
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.590
This woman...

178
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.689
suddenly attacked me.

179
00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:23.090
Then she pushed something.

180
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.029
The driver's seat went...

181
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.399
zoom. It went down.

182
00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:34.069
Then I was on my back pretty much.

183
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.409
Then suddenly, she...

184
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.350
She looked at me with weird eyes.

185
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.549
Then she...

186
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.490
She sent me strange signals.

187
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.490
Hey.

188
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.919
- Excuse me. - Yes?

189
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.819
What did the seat do?

190
00:11:53.819 --> 00:11:55.429
Zoom.

191
00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.260
See?

192
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.860
Where does it go zoom?

193
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.230
It's going down really slow.

194
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.640
Why did you lie?

195
00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.439
Zoom?

196
00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.309
Why doesn't it make that sound?

197
00:12:09.309 --> 00:12:11.580
- Get out. - Get out!

198
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.049
He confessed he was caught...

199
00:12:19.049 --> 00:12:21.289
while trying to steal from you, so he lied.

200
00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:23.289
We looked up his record,

201
00:12:23.289 --> 00:12:25.189
and he stole from drunk customers before.

202
00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:27.519
I'll get you an NPA.

203
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.730
You better.

204
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.199
Ms. Ma.

205
00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:33.960
How...

206
00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:36.230
have you been doing?

207
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.840
I was worried about you.

208
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.210
I've been doing well.

209
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.610
You don't have to worry.

210
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.179
We'll meet again.

211
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.220
- Pardon? - I haven't changed.

212
00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:58.460
I'm preparing for Kong Soo Ah's appeal,

213
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.490
and I also intend on helping...

214
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:02.830
your mother's case no matter what.

215
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.730
As a prosecutor.

216
00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:11.769
What about your mother?

217
00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:15.669
I haven't changed either.

218
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:18.140
I'll take care of my own business.

219
00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:21.110
Let me give you an advice.

220
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.480
Don't get involved in what you can't handle.

221
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:26.679
You'll blame me later.

222
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.470
(Electricity: 17 dollars, Balance: 866 dollars)

223
00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:49.569
Great timing.

224
00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:51.480
Do you know any good lawyers?

225
00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.210
I don't care how much it will cost.

226
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.679
This is an emergency.

227
00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:02.049
Stop denying it.

228
00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:03.220
Give me your dash cam then.

229
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.519
Hey, I don't have one.

230
00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.519
My car is just a piece of can.

231
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.189
Then I'll have to forward this to prosecution.

232
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:12.529
I told you it's not like that!

233
00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:14.929
I told you it's not like that!

234
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.140
I told you it's not like that!

235
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.370
Then you should make a deal.

236
00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:23.840
You're driving me crazy.

237
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.210
This is crazy.

238
00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:32.220
Okay.

239
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:35.149
Someone who used to be a prosecutor...

240
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.189
with expertise in sexual assault.

241
00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:40.519
Yes.

242
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.960
Okay.

243
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.199
(Ex-prosecutor, Ma Yi Deum)

244
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.610
(Witch's Court)

245
00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:06.679
Can you turn your body like this?

246
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.260
This one is okay, but the pose is bad.

247
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.860
I think we can do better.

248
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.029
Should we try again?

249
00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:17.130
I think it's good enough.

250
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.330
Really?

251
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.460
- Have it. - Okay.

252
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.439
- Should we do cheers? - Cheers.

253
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.279
Did you report a sexual assault?

254
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.149
It's a quasi-rape case...

255
00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:13.120
that was reported to the police.

256
00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:15.419
The accused is Lee Sang Hyun.

257
00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:17.319
He's 33 years old.

258
00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:19.220
He's a patissier of a famous dessert cafe...

259
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.720
that was on television called 679.

260
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.890
I've been there.

261
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.760
The wait time is really long there.

262
00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:27.159
The victim is Yang Yoo Jin.

263
00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:28.230
She's 30 years old.

264
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.470
She's a photographer of a cooking magazine.

265
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.140
Looking at the case report,

266
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.909
it could have been an agreed intercourse.

267
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.880
The victim suggested they go drinking,

268
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.179
and she walked to his place.

269
00:16:41.179 --> 00:16:42.179
Exactly.

270
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.350
Then why did the police think that...

271
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.949
it was a quasi-rape?

272
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:50.120
(Police record file)

273
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.590
I was just raped.

274
00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:55.490
I'm at...

275
00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.600
Because she called the police?

276
00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:01.029
Yes.

277
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.699
Five minutes after she called,

278
00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:04.640
it looks like the police called her back.

279
00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:06.239
What was this about?

280
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.709
While she was reporting with Lee's phone,

281
00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.610
the phone turned off. Maybe it was a mistake.

282
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.390
Hello?

283
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.219
Did you report a sexual assault?

284
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.820
Pardon?

285
00:17:31.999 --> 00:17:33.459
No, I'm sorry.

286
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.300
It was a prank call.

287
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.870
Okay.

288
00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:43.709
At first, they thought it was a prank call.

289
00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:46.009
But they found Yang in front of his place.

290
00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:47.880
She was in bad shape,

291
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.850
and she claimed she was raped.

292
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.719
That's why they investigated his house.

293
00:17:51.719 --> 00:17:54.489
Then they found a condom there.

294
00:17:54.489 --> 00:17:57.090
This case will go nowhere.

295
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.759
Why? It's true she was blacked out.

296
00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:00.820
She wasn't sane.

297
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.790
Because of a black out,

298
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.429
some people got an acquittal.

299
00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:05.830
The victim...

300
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.669
may not remember agreeing to the intercourse,

301
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:10.570
so the accused will be found not guilty.

302
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.169
What about the report she made?

303
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:14.199
While she was drunk, she knew it was rape.

304
00:18:14.199 --> 00:18:15.570
She was aware.

305
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.080
Some get acquittal because the victim reported.

306
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.739
If they were sane enough to make a report,

307
00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:21.310
it means they were sane.

308
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.080
It doesn't count as a quasi-rape.

309
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.409
Hence, innocent.

310
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:25.419
No way.

311
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.949
Go home if you're going to be like this.

312
00:18:28.989 --> 00:18:31.120
Does Article 229 of the criminal law...

313
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.459
look like a joke to you?

314
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.860
Because they're always found innocent,

315
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.360
do you think this is a drunken report?

316
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.959
Blacking out means he's innocent.

317
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.870
Even if she reports it, he's innocent.

318
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.630
Then there should never be...

319
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.040
anyone accused of quasi-rape.

320
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.040
The main agent is still the accused.

321
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.110
We need to discuss how the accused...

322
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.709
and the victim agreed...

323
00:18:53.709 --> 00:18:55.479
to have the intercourse first.

324
00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:01.320
You're admirable. You're the team's ace.

325
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.949
- I'm amazed. - Me?

326
00:19:02.949 --> 00:19:05.719
Ms. Jang, we should leave this case to Yeo.

327
00:19:05.719 --> 00:19:07.830
He has his head in the right spot.

328
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.790
A big case like this should be given...

329
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.530
to the juniors so they can grow.

330
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.630
Let's grow even more.

331
00:19:44.699 --> 00:19:45.699
Excuse me.

332
00:19:48.199 --> 00:19:50.169
We could meet at your office too.

333
00:19:50.229 --> 00:19:53.600
I thought you should talk somewhere familiar.

334
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.909
I was being considerate.

335
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.270
Is there a problem?

336
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.439
No... It's okay.

337
00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:03.479
Let's go.

338
00:20:14.189 --> 00:20:15.790
Before we start,

339
00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:17.790
let's set this right first.

340
00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:22.399
You should never lie to me.

341
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.330
Until the trial, we don't know...

342
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.070
what evidence prosecution will bring.

343
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.070
I can only fight from your testimony.

344
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.540
If it turns out to be a lie,

345
00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:34.580
it'd be over.

346
00:20:35.249 --> 00:20:36.350
Also,

347
00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:40.419
I hate getting backstabbed.

348
00:20:40.749 --> 00:20:42.850
The moment I find out you're lying,

349
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.719
the contract is over.

350
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.189
Do you understand?

351
00:20:48.489 --> 00:20:49.630
Yes, I understand.

352
00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:52.899
It happened while you were drunk,

353
00:20:53.229 --> 00:20:55.830
and the accused claims it was mutual.

354
00:20:55.929 --> 00:20:59.399
Your statement is very important.

355
00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:04.370
Please give us an honest and detailed response.

356
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.340
Naturally.

357
00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:10.050
You have no idea how small the magazine industry is.

358
00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:13.919
Who'd want a photographer who gets involved...

359
00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:15.419
in scandals with an interviewee?

360
00:21:15.949 --> 00:21:17.649
I knew that the moment I reported him...

361
00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:20.020
for sexual assault, I'd be accused of pulling...

362
00:21:20.189 --> 00:21:22.030
a honey trap, but I still reported the jerk.

363
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.830
Because I was so angry at what he did to me.

364
00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:26.959
What's your relationship with Yang Yoo Jin?

365
00:21:28.469 --> 00:21:30.530
I got to know her about a year ago...

366
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.969
while working with a magazine on a story.

367
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.040
We got along well...

368
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.810
and had similar interests.

369
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.350
We were interested in each other.

370
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.610
So, you had a fling?

371
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.749
That's right. We never labeled it,

372
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.749
but we were practically dating.

373
00:21:49.419 --> 00:21:50.520
Not at all.

374
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.189
He is not my type at all.

375
00:21:53.189 --> 00:21:54.759
Then why did you see him?

376
00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.159
You apparently asked to meet him first.

377
00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:00.399
I like meeting new people.

378
00:22:00.499 --> 00:22:01.499
Given my job,

379
00:22:01.499 --> 00:22:03.630
making and maintaining connections is a given.

380
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.239
That's all it was.

381
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.939
Maintaining connections professionally.

382
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.070
If it were professional,

383
00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:12.739
would she have bought drinks round after round?

384
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.050
Things were going really well that night.

385
00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:18.620
- Think about it. - Are you serious?

386
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.620
Yes.

387
00:22:20.949 --> 00:22:23.249
- I can read palms. - Pardon?

388
00:22:23.249 --> 00:22:24.489
Let me read yours.

389
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.689
I'm just kidding.

390
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:30.659
What?

391
00:22:31.229 --> 00:22:32.459
What was that?

392
00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:34.770
She wanted to continue drinking at my place.

393
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:37.840
I had no reason to refuse.

394
00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:40.999
I thought we were interested in each other.

395
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.649
You said she paid at the convenience store...

396
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.120
before going to your place, is that right?

397
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.390
Yes.

398
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.489
I like paying for others.

399
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.929
And to be honest,

400
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.929
women don't always have to let others pay.

401
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.340
You said you don't remember after the bar.

402
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.169
Do you remember paying?

403
00:23:17.739 --> 00:23:19.709
I have a habit of paying when I'm drunk.

404
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.409
I don't remember,

405
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.580
but it's sort of out of instinct.

406
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.149
How much can you drink?

407
00:23:25.249 --> 00:23:26.620
Four bottles of soju?

408
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.149
About 20 soju bombs?

409
00:23:32.189 --> 00:23:33.890
It says on the record that you drank...

410
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.489
two glasses of wine and three cocktails.

411
00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:38.600
That got you drunk?

412
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.140
I guess I wasn't feeling that great that night.

413
00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:48.840
It's strange how I blacked out.

414
00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.449
How did you end up reporting him?

415
00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:01.419
When I opened my eyes,

416
00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:03.320
that scumbag was on top of me.

417
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.489
I was shocked and pushed him off,

418
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.620
but he kept forcing himself onto me.

419
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.989
I said I'd report him if he continued,

420
00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:13.130
and he said to go ahead, and handed me the phone

421
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.330
So I really did report him.

422
00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:17.770
Because...

423
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.840
I felt like he'd force himself onto me otherwise.

424
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.729
Show me your security video...

425
00:24:42.729 --> 00:24:44.130
from 11pm on the 23rd...

426
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.800
- to 2am the next day. - Sorry?

427
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.830
I need to check something for a case.

428
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.600
Your cooperation is appreciated.

429
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.399
Do you need it for a sexual assault case?

430
00:24:54.509 --> 00:24:56.810
The prosecutor took a copy yesterday.

431
00:24:57.009 --> 00:24:58.239
Darn it.

432
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.580
But whom are you with?

433
00:25:07.419 --> 00:25:08.790
This is me.

434
00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:10.149
Call me anytime...

435
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:11.659
you've been wronged and need help.

436
00:25:11.659 --> 00:25:13.360
The security video please.

437
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.459
Why must I do that?

438
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.030
Is there a law that says I must help a lawyer?

439
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.239
A person's life...

440
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:34.380
lies in your hand, sir.

441
00:25:34.649 --> 00:25:36.050
Please help me, sir.

442
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:37.649
Please?

443
00:25:38.979 --> 00:25:40.080
If you're tired,

444
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.850
may I help you with something?

445
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:54.929
It's me, Ma Yi Deum.

446
00:25:55.169 --> 00:25:57.330
I will take your case.

447
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:58.899
I need a retainer of 1,000 dollars,

448
00:25:58.899 --> 00:26:01.310
and 40,000 dollars if we win. Deal?

449
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.179
Ms. Son. Where did you say they found the condom?

450
00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:14.649
I think it was in the nightstand?

451
00:26:14.649 --> 00:26:17.649
Regardless, they found it hidden somewhere.

452
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.159
It was hidden?

453
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.790
It doesn't say that here.

454
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.330
That can't be.

455
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:26.929
I heard it...

456
00:26:26.929 --> 00:26:29.399
from the detective investigating the case.

457
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.969
I'm sorry. I'm still new on the job,

458
00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:34.570
so I don't know how to photograph the scene.

459
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.669
Do you remember where you found it?

460
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.409
Come in.

461
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:41.610
- Excuse us. - Sure. Seriously.

462
00:26:56.729 --> 00:26:57.759
What?

463
00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.860
Please step aside.

464
00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:01.729
- Why? - Just a minute.

465
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.399
Why?

466
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.870
Hey.

467
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.739
Hey. What...

468
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.949
What? What? Why?

469
00:27:17.649 --> 00:27:18.649
I understand.

470
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.449
Let's begin questioning Lee Sang Hyun.

471
00:27:21.449 --> 00:27:22.449
Yes, sir.

472
00:27:36.969 --> 00:27:39.239
What are you doing here?

473
00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:42.540
(Power of Attorney)

474
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.870
Don't tell me...

475
00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:46.380
you represent him.

476
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.880
As you can see.

477
00:27:48.679 --> 00:27:50.649
Why are you doing this?

478
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.219
What's wrong with it?

479
00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:53.979
I'm just doing my job.

480
00:27:55.249 --> 00:27:56.290
Look.

481
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.020
I'll have to say it eventually, so here I go.

482
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.120
As long as we're both in law,

483
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.790
we'll keep running into each other.

484
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.630
If you keep being amateurish each time,

485
00:28:05.999 --> 00:28:07.159
it'll be a pain.

486
00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.770
You're a prosecutor, and I'm a lawyer.

487
00:28:10.169 --> 00:28:11.669
Let's each do our jobs.

488
00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:14.199
- Ms. Ma. - I assume you understand.

489
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.509
Mr. Yeo. Let's begin the interrogation.

490
00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:28.419
Lee Sang Hyun.

491
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.390
Why did you hide the condom?

492
00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.620
Sorry?

493
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.790
You don't need to answer everything.

494
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.199
I refuse to answer that question.

495
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.370
According to the officer who reported to the scene,

496
00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.469
a condom was found...

497
00:28:46.469 --> 00:28:48.969
wrapped in a tissue in the nightstand drawer,

498
00:28:48.969 --> 00:28:51.380
and that you couldn't explain.

499
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.840
I assume it was because it was clear evidence...

500
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.050
of sexual assault.

501
00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.080
Isn't that a push?

502
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.590
Saying a condom proves quasi-rape?

503
00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:04.560
He wouldn't have hid it if he had nothing to hide.

504
00:29:08.584 --> 00:29:11.816
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E11 Witch's Court "She Returns"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

505
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.570
I think I was too drunk...

506
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.140
and mistook it for the trash can.

507
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.340
You know how when guys get drunk,

508
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.880
we mistake the closet for the bathroom...

509
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.209
and pee into it and stuff.

510
00:29:28.709 --> 00:29:29.709
I don't know.

511
00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:31.919
I've never done that.

512
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.620
I mean it.

513
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.290
If I wanted to hide it,

514
00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.749
I would've flushed it down the toilet.

515
00:29:36.749 --> 00:29:37.820
Fine.

516
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.120
Let's take a polygraph.

517
00:29:42.259 --> 00:29:44.229
No. We refuse.

518
00:29:44.759 --> 00:29:46.100
Do you have any further questions?

519
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:49.699
Let's go.

520
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.310
The condom...

521
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.649
won't be usable as evidence in court.

522
00:30:02.979 --> 00:30:05.320
Drop the charges. Don't waste your time.

523
00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:07.020
We have more evidence.

524
00:30:07.219 --> 00:30:08.520
I will indict him.

525
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.489
I'll see you in court.

526
00:30:10.989 --> 00:30:12.060
Good luck.

527
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.120
Goodbye, Ms. Son.

528
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.090
Goodbye.

529
00:30:19.929 --> 00:30:21.770
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

530
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.399
My instincts told me that it was rape.

531
00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:27.800
That's why I reported him.

532
00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.640
What made you sure it was forced?

533
00:30:30.939 --> 00:30:32.780
You said you were too drunk...

534
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.110
and don't remember.

535
00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:36.749
When I woke up, he was holding me down.

536
00:30:39.979 --> 00:30:41.489
That man over there.

537
00:30:46.459 --> 00:30:48.189
I felt chills going down my spine,

538
00:30:48.189 --> 00:30:49.959
and I felt repulsed.

539
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.659
I remember him raping me...

540
00:30:51.999 --> 00:30:53.429
very clearly.

541
00:30:54.699 --> 00:30:56.729
If that isn't rape, what is?

542
00:30:59.939 --> 00:31:01.100
No more questions.

543
00:31:01.969 --> 00:31:03.709
Would you like to cross-examine the witness?

544
00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:04.709
Yes, Your Honor.

545
00:31:11.219 --> 00:31:12.350
Ms. Yang.

546
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.090
You testified that your relationship...

547
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.520
was purely professional, not romantic, correct?

548
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.259
Yes.

549
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.759
These are text messages you sent him that day.

550
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.600
Do you always send men you have no interest in...

551
00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:32.469
hearts like this?

552
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:36.040
That's just a habit.

553
00:31:37.209 --> 00:31:38.780
Check my messenger.

554
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:41.080
I did that to others too.

555
00:31:41.409 --> 00:31:42.979
I see. A habit.

556
00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.179
Then what about this?

557
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.090
You remember, don't you?

558
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.050
It is what you were wearing that day.

559
00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.759
Your Honor. Her outfit is irrelevant.

560
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.890
It is not. Think about it rationally.

561
00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.100
How convincing is it,

562
00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:01.830
that she wasn't trying to seduce him...

563
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.499
by wearing that?

564
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.499
Her outfit is purely a personal preference.

565
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.669
It is presumptuous to say...

566
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.709
she was trying to seduce him...

567
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.909
just because she dressed provocatively.

568
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.949
Counsel, control yourself.

569
00:32:16.249 --> 00:32:17.380
Yes, Your Honor.

570
00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:21.620
How much can you drink?

571
00:32:21.949 --> 00:32:23.919
When I'm feeling well, four bottles of soju.

572
00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:25.419
Two and a half if I'm not feeling well.

573
00:32:25.719 --> 00:32:28.189
How much did you drink on the night in question?

574
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.729
I had 2 glasses of wine and 3 cocktails.

575
00:32:31.959 --> 00:32:35.699
That means you drank less than half your usual.

576
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.040
Yes. That much doesn't even get me buzzed.

577
00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.969
It doesn't even get you buzzed.

578
00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:49.110
Then you must be lying that you were unconscious,

579
00:32:49.209 --> 00:32:52.020
or that you don't remember.

580
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.679
Correct?

581
00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:56.020
- What? - You just said...

582
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.659
that much doesn't even get you buzzed.

583
00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:02.590
Does your tolerance change based on the situation?

584
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.759
Your Honor. Counsel is leading the witness.

585
00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:09.699
Your Honor. We must prove whether the witness...

586
00:33:10.169 --> 00:33:13.969
was in fact unconscious, in order to prove...

587
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.409
the defendant's guilt.

588
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.209
You may proceed.

589
00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:39.030
As you can see, the defendant dragged...

590
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.530
the victim who could barely stand.

591
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.729
This proves the defendant...

592
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:44.370
tried to use her intoxicated state...

593
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.239
to force a sexual relation with her.

594
00:33:52.409 --> 00:33:56.149
I also submit the security video as evidence.

595
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.429
Why are you showing us this video?

596
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.929
These are the items the victim purchased.

597
00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.929
There is a condom among the items.

598
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:26.679
The victim...

599
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.179
saw the defendant place the condom on the counter,

600
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.779
but she paid for it anyway.

601
00:34:32.049 --> 00:34:33.750
How is this not consent?

602
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:37.920
Didn't you go to his apartment...

603
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.120
with the intention of having sex?

604
00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:41.390
Your Honor.

605
00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.460
Counsel is making unreasonable assertions.

606
00:34:43.529 --> 00:34:46.460
The victim may not have known it was a condom.

607
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.600
Do you have evidence to support that?

608
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.640
The burden of proof lies with the prosecution.

609
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.569
Without evidence to raise reasonable doubt,

610
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:59.710
the court must give the defendant...

611
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.250
the benefit of the doubt.

612
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.409
If you do not submit another piece of evidence,

613
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.650
I will render the decision accordingly.

614
00:35:26.699 --> 00:35:29.040
Thank you, Ms. Ma.

615
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.239
Also, here.

616
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.580
It's a restaurant where you can try my dessert.

617
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.250
Thank you for today.

618
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.980
Don't tell me you're trying to use this...

619
00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.750
as payment for winning.

620
00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.120
Of course not.

621
00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.390
In that case, thank you.

622
00:35:58.199 --> 00:35:59.299
Ms. Ma.

623
00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:03.540
Do you really think Lee Sang Hyun is innocent?

624
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.379
For my standards, yes.

625
00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.909
If you investigated him as you did...

626
00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:10.049
when you were with CAGU, you'd know he was guilty.

627
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.949
You saw the receipt, didn't you?

628
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.449
There's clear proof that she consented.

629
00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:21.230
What proof do you have that he's guilty?

630
00:36:23.629 --> 00:36:25.359
See? You have nothing to say.

631
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.629
You should've learned more from me.

632
00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.370
How could you go to court with such weak evidence?

633
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.270
This is a warzone.

634
00:36:42.279 --> 00:36:43.279
Seriously.

635
00:36:47.049 --> 00:36:49.489
I heard Yi Deum crushed you.

636
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.420
Here you go. Drink this.

637
00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.359
Drink it and chin up.

638
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:58.529
You're quick.

639
00:36:59.029 --> 00:37:01.699
Of course, you lost. You can't beat her.

640
00:37:01.699 --> 00:37:03.129
She's no joke.

641
00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.799
I know that too.

642
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.480
I'm going to the video room.

643
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.650
Stop. Watching it again won't make...

644
00:37:14.779 --> 00:37:16.379
evidence appear out of thin air.

645
00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:19.219
You need to breathe once in a while.

646
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.190
Give it up. There's a nice lounge bar nearby.

647
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.290
The Maldives.

648
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.319
How about we go to Mojito and have a Maldive?

649
00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.659
No thank you.

650
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.600
You punk. Listen to your senior prosecutor.

651
00:37:33.429 --> 00:37:36.830
4 bottles of soju? About 20 soju bombs?

652
00:37:36.969 --> 00:37:39.400
It says on the record that you drank...

653
00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.339
2 glasses of wine and 3 cocktails.

654
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:44.739
That got you drunk?

655
00:37:44.879 --> 00:37:47.850
I guess I wasn't feeling that great that night.

656
00:37:48.779 --> 00:37:51.850
It's strange how I blacked out.

657
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.920
Let's go to the lounge bar.

658
00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.159
You're becoming more like a real prosecutor.

659
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.790
Look how fancy. They even have flowers.

660
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.629
- You wanted to see me? - Yes.

661
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:08.199
I'm a prosecutor. Yeo Jin Wook.

662
00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:10.270
You don't take that out in a place like this.

663
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.100
He'll take care of you. Don't be lame.

664
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.469
Let's go.

665
00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:16.210
He's still new.

666
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.810
I remember them.

667
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.549
Was there anything unusual?

668
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:26.420
The woman...

669
00:38:27.319 --> 00:38:29.449
came in looking fine,

670
00:38:29.449 --> 00:38:32.390
but after having about three cocktails,

671
00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:34.989
she couldn't stand straight.

672
00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:37.690
- Were they strong drinks? - No.

673
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.830
They were very weak.

674
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.699
She had a Blue Hawaii.

675
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.739

704
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.909
Yes. She insisted that I show it to you.

709
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.640
They had very little alcohol content.

That's correct.

Let me do a demonstration.

718
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.549
This is a date rape drug.

719
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.949
It incapacitates the drinker...

720
00:43:25.949 --> 00:43:27.850
and causes temporary memory loss.

721
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.989
When mixed with alcohol,

722
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.359
it turns blue like this.

723
00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:34.589
What are you trying to say?

724
00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:36.629
The victim testified...

725
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.730
that she drank much less than her usual,

726
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.029
but suddenly experienced memory loss.

727
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.929
That proves the defendant...

728
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.770
added a drug into the blue cocktail...

729
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:47.969
the victim drank,

730
00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:49.870
incapacitating her,

731
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.310

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.460
(Mayor of Yeongpa, Cho Gap Soo)

848
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.449
Hi, Ms. Heo.

849
00:51:43.879 --> 00:51:45.319
The event is all ready.

850
00:51:45.449 --> 00:51:48.150
I will make Yeongpa a happy...

851
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:49.850
and good city.

852
00:51:51.259 --> 00:51:52.520
Good job.

853
00:51:53.759 --> 00:51:55.029
Thank you.

854
00:51:55.429 --> 00:51:57.230
You did great.

855
00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.600
You were good.

856
00:52:03.029 --> 00:52:04.230
Yes, yes.

857
00:52:05.469 --> 00:52:06.540
Bye.

858
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:07.940
Sir.

859
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:10.270
- Hello. - Your approval rating...

860
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:12.279
broke 70 percent within three months.

861
00:52:12.409 --> 00:52:15.210
What do you think is the reason for that?

862
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.359
(Delete portions... suicide note...)

863
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.069
I'm sorry, sir.

864
00:52:59.859 --> 00:53:02.560
The idea for today's event...

865
00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:05.929
came from my chief assistant.

866
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:07.969
I see.

867
00:53:21.879 --> 00:53:23.710
Your appeal has been scheduled.

868
00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.850
I repeat. I didn't kill Soo Ah.

869
00:53:29.449 --> 00:53:30.890
If you want to clear your name,

870
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.859
we must prove Ahn Tae Kyoo was guilty.

871
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:37.830
You should work at that as well.

872
00:53:39.199 --> 00:53:40.299
Work?

873
00:53:41.429 --> 00:53:42.629
Work.

874
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.370
Like what?

875
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.109
All I have is a useless public defender.

876
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:50.810
I'm searching as well.

877
00:53:57.449 --> 00:54:00.049
I hear you're refusing Ms. Ma's visitations.

878
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.350
I don't feel like seeing her,

879
00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:08.330
since she's at fault too, for my brother's death.

880
00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:14.600
I'm sure she's looking into your brother's death.

881
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.339
If you change your mind, ask the guard to call her.

882
00:54:29.509 --> 00:54:31.549
Hello? Police?

883
00:54:31.679 --> 00:54:34.819
I'd like to report an illegal loan shark.

884
00:54:35.049 --> 00:54:37.049
They're evil scumbags...

885
00:54:37.049 --> 00:54:39.989
that bleed poor innocent people dry.

886
00:54:40.759 --> 00:54:42.390
Come quickly and take them all away.

887
00:54:42.629 --> 00:54:45.600
Yes. My name? My Yi Deum. I'm a prosec...

888
00:54:46.629 --> 00:54:47.900
I'm a lawyer.

889
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:50.100
Yes. Have a nice day.

890
00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:52.870
Why that little...

891
00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.839
- Are you on your way? - It's me, Son Mi Young.

892
00:54:57.509 --> 00:55:00.279
- Yes, Ms. Son. - I called because...

893
00:55:00.679 --> 00:55:02.250
a law firm that I know...

894
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:05.080
is looking for a very good lawyer.

895
00:55:05.279 --> 00:55:06.779
Are you interested?

896
00:55:06.949 --> 00:55:08.120
A law firm?

897
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:12.390
- Where? - Jeongso Law Group.

898
00:55:13.159 --> 00:55:14.319
Jeongso?

899
00:55:15.359 --> 00:55:16.790
(Jeongso Law Group)

900
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:18.560
Yes. Okay.

901
00:55:20.259 --> 00:55:22.500
- What did she say? - She'll check them out.

902
00:55:45.259 --> 00:55:47.219
It's suite 415.

903
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:52.129
Where's 415?

904
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:56.000
- Excuse me. - Yes?

905
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.440
Do you know where Jeongso Law Group is?

906
00:55:59.469 --> 00:56:01.409
- That way. - Thank you.

907

(Jeongso Law Group)

908
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.819
Thank you very much.

909
00:56:18.819 --> 00:56:21.989
- Not at all. - Thank you so very much.

910
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.259
Okay.

911
00:56:23.929 --> 00:56:25.859
Here, have these.

912
00:56:25.859 --> 00:56:27.029
Here.

913
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.029
Eat these.

914
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.170
You didn't have to.

915
00:56:31.339 --> 00:56:33.100
I said I'd do it for free.

916
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.710
I grew these sweet potatoes myself.

917
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:38.540
They taste really good if you bake them.

918
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.310
Okay. Thank you.

919
00:56:43.049 --> 00:56:44.080
Ma?

920
00:56:45.219 --> 00:56:47.949
How have you been? I was in the area...

921
00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.750
and thought I'd stop by. You look busy, so...

922
00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.259
I'm not busy.

923
00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:54.589
I see. You're not.

924
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:57.529
I'll see you out.

925
00:57:01.699 --> 00:57:03.429
Get home safely.

926
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:05.299
- Have a nice day. - You too.

927
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.040
- Goodbye. - You too.

928
00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:11.179
Have a nice day.

929
00:57:15.609 --> 00:57:18.420
- What are you doing? Sit. - Sure. I'll do that.

930
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:22.790
How have you been?

931
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.359
Me? I'm always doing well.

932
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:29.890
Aren't you here because I'm hiring a lawyer?

933
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.400
You're hiring a lawyer?

934
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.569
What a waste.

935
00:57:35.799 --> 00:57:39.069
I got a call this morning from another law firm,

936
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.900
so I agreed to go there.

937
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.540
- You did? - Yes.

938
00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:48.949
Yun Hee.

939
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:53.420
You have a guest, so I'll go.

940
00:57:55.989 --> 00:57:57.589
Please have a seat.

941
00:58:01.629 --> 00:58:02.759
Okay, then.

942
00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:03.859
Bye.

943
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.730
I'm finally going in.

944
00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:10.870
We can finally nab Cho Gap Soo.

Pardon?
