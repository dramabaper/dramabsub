1
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.326
I'm getting a divorce.

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.228
What?

3
00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:15.332
Oh, my.

4
00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:17.901
What?

5
00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:22.305
What did you just say?

6
00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:24.241
Say that again.

7
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:26.777
Yeon Ju and I agreed...

8
00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:29.880
to get a divorce.

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.014
What?

10
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.117
What? Who said you could do that?

11
00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:36.520
Who said so?

12
00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:43.827
Okay.

13
00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:45.862
Yeon Ju must not want to live like this.

14
00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.533
Does she want a divorce...

15
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.001
because I told her to live with us?

16
00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:53.070
Okay.

17
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.573
We'll get the big house that she wants...

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.943
even if we have to take a loan.

19
00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:01.344
Father.

20
00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.880
Don't say anything. Just do as I tell you.

21
00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:06.650
Whatever it takes, we have 
to stop you from divorcing.

22
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:10.087
If she's complaining about the house, 
get her a big house.

23
00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:11.755
If she's complaining about Han Gyul,

24
00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.690
we'll take Han Gyul with us.

25
00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:14.958
I asked...

26
00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.127
for the divorce.

27
00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:21.064
What?

28
00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.234
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.703
Why would you ask Yeon Ju for a divorce?

30
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.139
You two decided to move out,

31
00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.208
so you went to find a hospital and a house.

32
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.310
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

33
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.978
It's not a sudden change.

34
00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:37.314
I've been thinking about this,

35
00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:39.850
but I couldn't stand it anymore.

36
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.752
What couldn't you stand anymore? What are your complaints?

37
00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:44.187
Father, you already know.

38
00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:45.789
I married Yeon Ju because of her money.

39
00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:49.759
Living with Yeon Ju is only trouble...

40
00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:51.428
without her mother's money.

41
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.565
It would be better to divorce her than living...

42
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.902
with someone who is vain and doesn't have a sense of reality.

43
00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:00.070
How dare you!

44
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.339
Honey.

45
00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:08.345
Are you serious?

46
00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:10.447
Don't you know how much I went through to raise you?

47
00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:12.782
How could you say that in front of me?

48
00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:17.387
If you get a divorce at this age,

49
00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:20.357
you're only going to be a divorced man with a child.

50
00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:23.827
The hospital, your family, and everything else will be ruined.

51
00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:25.028
You'll remain with nothing.

52
00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:28.498
I didn't make you get married...

53
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.433
to her for this to happen.

54
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.370
No, never.

55
00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:35.172
I will never let this happen.

56
00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.542
Whatever you do, I won't allow you to divorce.

57
00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:40.577
I won't let you divorce!

58
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.412
- No way! - Honey.

59
00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:43.547
- Honey. - Dad.

60
00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:44.681
Leave him alone.

61
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.150
He has to know...

62
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.852
that it's really over.

63
00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:00.197
(Episode 20)

64
00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:05.835
Ma'am, what should I do?

65
00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.004
Should I bring your daughter down?

66
00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.774
She won't listen to you.

67
00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:12.876
Come inside.

68
00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:20.250
What did you say? Say it one more time.

69
00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.086
She has big eyes, and she's wearing checked clothes.

70
00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:24.154
Are you sure it was her?

71
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.522
Yes, she already left.

72
00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:28.024
She was too drunk, so we called for a driver.

73
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.760
Where did she go?

74
00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:32.596
She didn't come home.

75
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.203
Yes, I was about to call you.

76
00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:42.005
Did Yeon Ju come home?

77
00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:44.541
We have a big problem. Please hurry home.

78
00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:46.843
What is it?

79
00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:49.813
It's about Yeon Ju. You need to get here as soon as possible.

80
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.281
It's a big problem.

81
00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:52.749
Okay.

82
00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:54.851
What happened? What is this fuss about?

83
00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:57.621
- She asked me to hurry back. - Okay, ma'am.

84
00:03:57.621 --> 00:03:58.922
Excuse us.

85
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.960
Let me ask you one last time.

86
00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:06.029
You love So Won with all your heart, don't you?

87
00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.030
Of course I do.

88
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.165
Then if you can live with him,

89
00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.900
you're ready to do whatever it takes, right?

90
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.802
Yes. Of course.

91
00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:18.308
All right. I can fix this.

92
00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:21.578
No, I must fix this.

93
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:27.517
- My goodness, look at her. - I can't believe this.

94
00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.319
- What a sight. - My goodness.

95
00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.254
She's buried in there.

96
00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:33.156
- My goodness. - Look at that.

97
00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:36.159
What's going on there?

98
00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:38.828
- Hey, get her out. - What is she doing in there?

99
00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:41.398
What took you so long? We have a crisis.

100
00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:42.432
What...

101
00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:44.334
- What's going on with her? - Hey, miss.

102
00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:46.169
- What are you doing? - Come out of there.

103
00:04:50.774 --> 00:04:52.042
Gosh, Yeon Ju.

104
00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:53.510
Yeon Ju.

105
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.512
Don't even try. I tried to talk to her,

106
00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:57.580
but she's too wasted to even move.

107
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.816
She was singing and crying a little while ago.

108
00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:02.085
My goodness. You should've seen her. She was a hot mess.

109
00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:04.321
- Grab her. - Yeon Ju, wake up. Wake up.

110
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:05.522
- Baby. - Ms. Ha.

111
00:05:05.522 --> 00:05:08.491
- Ms. Ha, get yourself together. - Let go!

112
00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:11.995
- Hey, hey. - Darn.

113
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.900
Hey, hey.

114
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:20.070
My hands are tied. I must do something.

115
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.472
- Fire! There's a fire! - Fire!

116
00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:26.876
- Fire! - Fire!

117
00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:28.078
- There's a fire. - Fire?

118
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:30.113
Mom, there's a fire?

119
00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:32.716
I must call So Won. Call the fire department.

120
00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:34.684
- I already called him. - Honey, there's a fire!

121
00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:36.086
- Get her inside. - There's a fire.

122
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.588
So Won, there's a fire. Come out quickly.

123
00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.757
- Come out. Hello? - My goodness.

124
00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.392
- Hello? - Ms. Ha, on my back, please.

125
00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:44.694
- There's a fire. - Ms. Ha.

126
00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:46.062
So Won.

127
00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:48.431
- There's a fire. - Yes, a fire.

128
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.634
- Be careful. - My goodness.

129
00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:53.002
Let go of me.

130
00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.138
Please go back inside. I apologize for the noise.

131
00:05:55.138 --> 00:05:56.873
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:56.873 --> 00:05:58.508
- Please go back inside. - How embarrassing.

133
00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:02.045
Who parked this vegetable truck in front of my house at this hour?

134
00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:05.382
My gosh, it's always the fussy one that causes trouble.

135
00:06:05.382 --> 00:06:07.884
I can't believe this ridiculous stunt she just pulled.

136
00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:11.154
She couldn't have embarrassed me more than this.

137
00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:44.554
So Won.

138
00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:47.891
What happened?

139
00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:50.727
I'm sorry. It just happened.

140
00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:52.796
What do you mean?

141
00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:56.666
You said everything will work out only a few days ago.

142
00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:02.105
No, you even loved her.

143
00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:03.973
Mom.

144
00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:05.975
Yeon Ju...

145
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.678
is a flower in a sheltered garden.

146
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:12.749
And the garden is big and fancy.

147
00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:17.487
She has never faced a single hardship in her life.

148
00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:22.058
She's going to wither away if she lives with me.

149
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.161
I didn't want...

150
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.665
to see her wither away.

151
00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:33.503
You were serious.

152
00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:35.538
You really loved her.

153
00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:38.408
Does she know that you love her?

154
00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:40.977
What good would it do?

155
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.979
Our marriage is already over.

156
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.418
What do you plan to do next?

157
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.789
I'm going to live my life the best way I can.

158
00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:56.559
Now, I'm an unemployed father with a kid.

159
00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:01.231
Fine. All right.

160
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.934
Let me feed you first.

161
00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:08.371
In a time of crisis, you must eat your meals to gain energy.

162
00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:12.242
Come to the dining room. I'll heat up the soup.

163
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.656
Han Gyul, let's eat.

164
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:30.994
Aunt Ru Ri.

165
00:08:31.528 --> 00:08:32.595
Yes?

166
00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:37.367
The lady with big eyes isn't going to be my mom?

167
00:08:39.702 --> 00:08:42.872
She doesn't like me, does she?

168
00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:48.478
But I like her.

169
00:08:58.454 --> 00:08:59.956
I know.

170
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:03.860
You're so pretty and kind.

171
00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:07.864
I'm really sad too.

172
00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:25.481
Mrs. Yang, how is Yeon Ju doing?

173
00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:28.117
When I'm drunk like her,

174
00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:31.854
my wife would make juice with radish for me.

175
00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:34.157
You're here because of the divorce, aren't you?

176
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.726
No, no. What divorce?

177
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.330
My immature son hasn't thought this through.

178
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.699
I'm sure he didn't mean to end it with her,

179
00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:43.967
so just forget about what he did.

180
00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:45.501
Hold on.

181
00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:48.137
I'll do the talking.

182
00:09:48.438 --> 00:09:51.608
Sure. Of course. I won't stop you.

183
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:54.410
I have nothing to say.

184
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.212
Please go on.

185
00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:58.281
You just saw what happened, did you not?

186
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:00.984
How drunk my daughter got?

187
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.953
She never once lost it even though she drank...

188
00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:06.956
kegs of alcohol when she was young.

189
00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:09.292
The fact that she showed me the worst side of her...

190
00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:13.463
means that she's having the hardest time with the divorce.

191
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:18.101
That's why I came to apologize.

192
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.204
I'll ask for forgiveness on behalf of So Won.

193
00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.072
Please forgive him.

194
00:10:23.072 --> 00:10:27.710
No, no. I'm sick of this.

195
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.779
This is where it ends.

196
00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:32.148
I'm sure you can see where this is going.

197
00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:36.452
People around our age know what lies ahead of them.

198
00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:38.755
We can see their future clearly.

199
00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:42.392
Here's my opinion. Couples...

200
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:45.428
who are going to make it won't have to struggle...

201
00:10:45.428 --> 00:10:47.130
so hard to overcome their hardship.

202
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.966
However, couples who won't end up together...

203
00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:54.037
struggle desperately to just stay together,

204
00:10:54.037 --> 00:10:57.874
but those couples are not fated to be together. They're ill-fated.

205
00:10:58.441 --> 00:10:59.976
Please let Yeon Ju go.

206
00:11:00.677 --> 00:11:01.711
Mrs. Yang.

207
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:05.248
I am really sad he won't be my son-in-law.

208
00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:07.717
He's handsome and smart.

209
00:11:07.717 --> 00:11:09.852
Although he could be a bit cold-hearted,

210
00:11:09.852 --> 00:11:13.089
it's only natural for those successful ones to act like one.

211
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.459
I was afraid that he wouldn't let Yeon Ju go...

212
00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:19.362
and would drag her down with him,

213
00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:21.364
but he was a man after all.

214
00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:25.735
Then do you...

215
00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:28.938
Do you really...

216
00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:32.108
want them to get a divorce?

217
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.844
Yes.

218
00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.612
Let's end this.

219
00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:42.618
Then your daughter won't be able to turn back,

220
00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:45.855
and you're ready to deal with the consequence of the divorce?

221
00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:49.358
Yes, I am. I'm ready to accept it.

222
00:11:50.326 --> 00:11:52.495
Doctor Lee and Yeon Ju's marriage...

223
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.497
is over.

224
00:11:56.432 --> 00:11:58.401
My relationship with you...

225
00:11:58.868 --> 00:12:00.670
ends today as well.

226
00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:15.818
What is this?

227
00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:17.620
Open it.

228
00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:28.364
(Cashier's check: 500,000 dollars)

229
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:34.270
I'm not petty.

230
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:38.841
Doctor Lee will need some fund to open up a clinic.

231
00:12:39.142 --> 00:12:43.112
I'm giving you this as a way of thanking him...

232
00:12:44.313 --> 00:12:45.715
for letting Yeon Ju go.

233
00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:49.852
(Cashier's check: 500,000 dollars)

234
00:12:52.722 --> 00:12:55.391
I decided to work as a pay doctor at my friend's hospital in Suwon.

235
00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:07.470
Thank you.

236
00:13:10.473 --> 00:13:12.775
The amount isn't what I expected.

237
00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:15.111
It's the thought that counts.

238
00:13:15.411 --> 00:13:17.280
I'll keep it for now.

239
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:21.250
What do you mean by "for now"?

240
00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:33.729
Why did you take it out?

241
00:13:34.664 --> 00:13:37.867
It's not for my pride.

242
00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.268
Are you saying...

243
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:43.873
it's not enough or what?

244
00:13:46.342 --> 00:13:48.945
The man should give alimony, not the woman.

245
00:13:50.213 --> 00:13:52.815
Tell Yeon Ju when she sobers up.

246
00:13:53.783 --> 00:13:56.485
So Won's giving alimony...

247
00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:00.990
for her to live her life well...

248
00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.859
without So Won.

249
00:14:05.862 --> 00:14:09.098
Forgive me for all the hassles...

250
00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:11.200
I caused until now as an in-law.

251
00:14:12.702 --> 00:14:13.870
Take care of yourself.

252
00:14:36.092 --> 00:14:37.727
He does have pride.

253
00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:43.599
Both him and Dr. Lee are real men.

254
00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:48.571
My goodness.

255
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.723
If there's one thing I'm very proud of in my life,

256
00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:11.394
that would be having So Won and raising him.

257
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:13.863
That's how precious he is.

258
00:15:14.797 --> 00:15:16.365
I can't let him marry just anyone.

259
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.200
What's the purpose of my life?

260
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:20.770
Making you successful...

261
00:15:22.204 --> 00:15:24.507
and helping you reach higher.

262
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:26.375
You have to be happier...

263
00:15:26.943 --> 00:15:29.245
and be prouder.

264
00:15:29.578 --> 00:15:31.614
Why would you taint your life?

265
00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:37.253
I'll handle all the hassles,

266
00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:41.590
so don't worry about anything. Just walk on the flowery path.

267
00:15:42.325 --> 00:15:43.993
Like now.

268
00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:45.361
Okay?

269
00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:08.985
What are you doing here?

270
00:16:09.952 --> 00:16:11.754
My precious doctor.

271
00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:14.724
Let's go home, Father.

272
00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:18.227
Hey, So Won.

273
00:16:18.828 --> 00:16:22.965
That old lady begged me...

274
00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:24.867
to take back the divorce,

275
00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:26.969
but I rejected it.

276
00:16:28.337 --> 00:16:30.573
It's absolutely over now.

277
00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:33.743
So you should not regret as well.

278
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.113
Yeon Ju's not the only woman in this world.

279
00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:40.449
Sure, Father.

280
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.518
There are so many.

281
00:16:43.486 --> 00:16:44.587
Right.

282
00:16:44.787 --> 00:16:46.956
Cheer up.

283
00:16:47.556 --> 00:16:49.158
It doesn't have to be them.

284
00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:51.093
You can always get back on your feet again.

285
00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:54.830
I'll get a loan and help you open your own clinic.

286
00:16:55.464 --> 00:17:00.236
Center of Gangnam will be a bit difficult.

287
00:17:01.404 --> 00:17:03.239
Let's go with Gangbuk.

288
00:17:05.307 --> 00:17:07.143
- Father. - Hey.

289
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.345
You may not know,

290
00:17:10.146 --> 00:17:11.680
but I'm still alive.

291
00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:13.115
You know?

292
00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:15.718
Country of heat. Dubai.

293
00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:17.753
Saudi. Qatar.

294
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.723
I took over the three main countries in the Middle East.

295
00:17:21.991 --> 00:17:25.027
You're the son of that awesome man, so don't be discouraged.

296
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.630
Never. Okay?

297
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.505
My great son.

298
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.442
You're my life.

299
00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:42.311
My pride.

300
00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:44.747
My everything.

301
00:17:45.414 --> 00:17:47.283
My So Won.

302
00:17:52.388 --> 00:17:54.490
(Sungjin Gosiwon)

303
00:17:54.757 --> 00:17:56.792
Is this where you live?

304
00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:57.960
Yes.

305
00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:03.966
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.303
I asked you to come early to a lousy place.

307
00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:12.274
My grandma told me to...

308
00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:14.710
give you fresh grape juice.

309
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.880
Does your grandmother grow grapes?

310
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.682
Just a little bit.

311
00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:21.650
Try it.

312
00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:23.486
Thank you.

313
00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:35.064
I'm really sorry, Myung Rang.

314
00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:37.032
What are you sorry about?

315
00:18:40.302 --> 00:18:42.338
I'm sorry I broke everything, Sung Tan.

316
00:18:42.905 --> 00:18:43.973
Do you trust me?

317
00:18:53.949 --> 00:18:55.718
Let me sleep!

318
00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:58.187
We didn't do anything.

319
00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.421
Go back to sleep.

320
00:19:04.627 --> 00:19:06.395
I'm sorry, Myung Rang.

321
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.663
What's there to be sorry?

322
00:19:07.963 --> 00:19:09.064
Do you trust me?

323
00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:14.937
Hey!

324
00:19:16.472 --> 00:19:18.474
I give up. I give up!

325
00:19:18.974 --> 00:19:20.776
You're so cheap.

326
00:19:25.714 --> 00:19:27.183
Let's just go to work early.

327
00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:36.192
I'll tell everyone that we're in a relationship...

328
00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:38.727
to stop you from being nervous.

329
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.629
There's no need.

330
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:45.301
If we need other people to know to continue our relationship,

331
00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:48.437
it means it's already falling apart.

332
00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:56.445
Why would you sigh?

333
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.616
I'm upset because your brother...

334
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:02.751
is filing divorce document today.

335
00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:06.288
You should sleep for more.

336
00:20:06.722 --> 00:20:08.524
Did you sleep at all last night?

337
00:20:08.724 --> 00:20:10.226
I can't quit being a mom...

338
00:20:10.693 --> 00:20:12.194
only because I'm upset.

339
00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:21.070
I'll just have some bread. You don't need to.

340
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.605
I'll heat the soup.

341
00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:23.973
Eat before you go to work.

342
00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:26.775
Mom.

343
00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:32.147
I still have good news for you.

344
00:20:33.716 --> 00:20:37.019
I'm becoming a regular employee today.

345
00:20:38.053 --> 00:20:40.055
Really? Are you sure?

346
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:44.126
Chief Director promised me last time.

347
00:20:44.126 --> 00:20:46.095
He said I just need to wait for the official announcement.

348
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.198
Good job.

349
00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:51.734
You've suffered so much.

350
00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:53.636
Congratulations.

351
00:20:54.703 --> 00:20:57.473
So cheer up, Mom. Okay?

352
00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.275
Good luck, Mom.

353
00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:11.987
Leave immediately.

354
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:14.690
How dare you come here?

355
00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:18.761
What's she up to?

356
00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:21.730
So show me some gratitude.

357
00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:23.766
Leave now.

358
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.735
I'm not interested in what's already been paid.

359
00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:30.739
They must be fighting.

360
00:21:32.007 --> 00:21:35.210
Let's help each other, okay?

361
00:21:35.944 --> 00:21:37.579
Who is he?

362
00:21:37.946 --> 00:21:39.048
Her boyfriend?

363
00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:41.417
I think he's from the print shop.

364
00:21:51.293 --> 00:21:52.795
Is the announcement up already?

365
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.672
(Personnel appointment announcement)

366
00:22:05.674 --> 00:22:07.910
(2017 personnel appointment: Kim Sung Tan, a regular employee)

367
00:22:08.844 --> 00:22:10.279
What happened?

368
00:22:11.013 --> 00:22:13.716
Why's there Sung Tan but not me?

369
00:22:15.784 --> 00:22:17.252
It can't be.

370
00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:25.160
There must've been a mistake.

371
00:22:29.465 --> 00:22:31.633
How did this happen, Chief Director?

372
00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:35.003
I thought Lee Ru Ri was going to be a regular employee for sure.

373
00:22:35.704 --> 00:22:36.805
Have you forgotten?

374
00:22:37.473 --> 00:22:41.009
The company almost got into trouble because of Lee Ru Ri twice.

375
00:22:42.211 --> 00:22:44.713
She ruined the sampling event due to an order mistake.

376
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.149
She should've expected this...

377
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.585
after all the complaints we received from the restaurants.

378
00:22:49.718 --> 00:22:50.819
I agree...

379
00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:52.621
that she's not used to data processing...

380
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:54.490
because it's her first time working in the company,

381
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.060
but she has a talent to cover that up.

382
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:02.164
Also, she developed the top selling menu in the country.

383
00:23:02.164 --> 00:23:05.134
That helped her get this far.

384
00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.803
I've extended her contract for three more months.

385
00:23:08.604 --> 00:23:10.406
If she doesn't show any improvements,

386
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.474
she'll be fired.

387
00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:14.743
Keep that in mind.

388
00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:38.667
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:39.234 --> 00:23:41.036
I should have stopped it.

390
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:44.773
I will meet with Chairman Kevin and talk to him again.

391
00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:46.408
Just wait a little longer.

392
00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:49.778
Please,

393
00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:54.183
I'm not your assistant anymore.

394
00:23:54.483 --> 00:23:56.685
You don't need to intervene too much.

395
00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:01.457
I'll become a regular employee on my own without your help.

396
00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:37.226
Dad finally said you can work at the company.

397
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.829
I'm so happy nowadays thanks to you.

398
00:24:41.129 --> 00:24:42.931
Good luck, Ru Ri.

399
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.435
This is a knife I used when I was a novice.

400
00:24:46.435 --> 00:24:49.438
Congratulations on entering to the world of cooking.

401
00:24:51.273 --> 00:24:54.009
Lee Ru Ri, you don't cook alone.

402
00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:56.979
If everyone does what they are supposed to do,

403
00:24:57.412 --> 00:24:58.947
we can create a fantastic taste.

404
00:24:58.947 --> 00:25:00.549
I'll do the cooking.

405
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:03.785
You just have to help me with your sensitive palate.

406
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.221
- Well done. - Well done.

407
00:25:07.556 --> 00:25:09.191
The sauce was wonderful.

408
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:10.392
I'm looking forward to it.

409
00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:22.704
Are you all right, Ru Ri?

410
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:24.706
I'm sorry...

411
00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:27.209
that only Sung Tan was appointed as a regular employee.

412
00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:31.213
I feel so sorry for my mom.

413
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:35.284
She was so happy this morning to hear that...

414
00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:37.019
I was becoming a regular employee.

415
00:25:37.553 --> 00:25:40.022
Why did you make a mistake like that?

416
00:25:40.022 --> 00:25:41.390
It's not like you to do that.

417
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.626
You can be dumb sometimes,

418
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:46.261
but you're always meticulous.

419
00:25:46.261 --> 00:25:48.664
That's what's driving me crazy.

420
00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:50.766
Let's say I understand what happened to the first one.

421
00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:53.235
I really don't get what happened with the posters.

422
00:25:54.002 --> 00:25:57.539
I checked with the company so many times to not make mistakes.

423
00:25:59.741 --> 00:26:02.844
This can't keep happening to me unless someone...

424
00:26:03.211 --> 00:26:05.280
deliberately wants me to fail.

425
00:26:06.114 --> 00:26:07.249
Wait a moment.

426
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.019
What if someone was really trying to ruin you?

427
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.155
Who would do that?

428
00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:14.790
Joo Ae Ri.

429
00:26:15.123 --> 00:26:18.060
She keeps flirting with Manager Jung.

430
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.761
Without you,

431
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:22.197
she won't have any competitors.

432
00:26:23.532 --> 00:26:26.535
She wouldn't do this just for that reason.

433
00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:27.836
Wait a moment.

434
00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:31.139
I think it's her!

435
00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:35.010
This morning, I saw her with the worker from the printing shop.

436
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.346
Let's go and ruin her.

437
00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.314
It can't be.

438
00:26:39.514 --> 00:26:42.451
When I asked him about what happened to the posters,

439
00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:44.920
he became really angry...

440
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.156
and told me if I was telling him he's someone who could be...

441
00:26:48.156 --> 00:26:49.891
bribed into switching the posters.

442
00:26:50.659 --> 00:26:52.694
A guilty conscience needs no accuser.

443
00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:56.665
Let's do this properly.

444
00:27:01.403 --> 00:27:02.738
Excuse me.

445
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.408
Who are you?

446
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.345
Joo Ae Ri sent me.

447
00:27:11.413 --> 00:27:12.948
What is this about?

448
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:16.251
She's sorry about what happened this morning.

449
00:27:16.251 --> 00:27:20.389
And we have the second design for the poster.

450
00:27:20.522 --> 00:27:24.292
We want to ask you for a switch like we did last time.

451
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.029
You should give me a double this time.

452
00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:29.631
If my boss finds out, he'll kill me.

453
00:27:30.532 --> 00:27:31.667
Lee Jung Sik!

454
00:27:33.969 --> 00:27:35.003
Boss.

455
00:27:35.003 --> 00:27:36.672
Tell us everything.

456
00:27:37.439 --> 00:27:40.342
Tell us what Joo Ae Ri made you do.

457
00:27:40.342 --> 00:27:42.044
I... Oh, my.

458
00:27:42.244 --> 00:27:44.012
Tell us everything.

459
00:27:44.012 --> 00:27:46.181
Boss, I don't know who she is.

460
00:27:46.181 --> 00:27:47.582
Get your arm warmers off.

461
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:51.420
Look down.

462
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.688
- Speak humbly. - Yes, ma'am.

463
00:27:52.688 --> 00:27:54.022
Tell us everything you know.

464
00:27:54.022 --> 00:27:55.190
I don't know anything.

465
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.925
- I'll punch you. - I'm sorry.

466
00:28:00.562 --> 00:28:02.464
You are not capable of living with me forever,

467
00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:05.567
both as a wife and a mother.

468
00:28:07.636 --> 00:28:09.404
All because I met the wrong man.

469
00:28:09.404 --> 00:28:11.239
I used to be so popular,

470
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.375
but now I look so ugly.

471
00:28:21.516 --> 00:28:22.984
Are you ready?

472
00:28:23.218 --> 00:28:24.219
Let's go.

473
00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:25.520
Are you going too?

474
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.222
Of course.

475
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:30.125
I need to go with you. I don't trust you.

476
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:32.227
Why can't you trust me?

477
00:28:32.227 --> 00:28:33.829
Don't you really know why?

478
00:28:34.196 --> 00:28:37.032
You lose all your pride...

479
00:28:37.032 --> 00:28:40.435
and fall all over Dr. Lee whenever you see him.

480
00:28:40.435 --> 00:28:43.972
I'm just worried that you might cry and beg...

481
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.508
instead of signing the divorce papers.

482
00:28:46.608 --> 00:28:50.278
Don't worry. I don't have any feelings for him now.

483
00:28:50.746 --> 00:28:53.982
He said he never loved me...

484
00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:56.218
and only married me for money.

485
00:28:56.952 --> 00:28:58.720
Gosh, that scum.

486
00:29:00.722 --> 00:29:02.224
Wait... Wait.

487
00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:06.361
Are you crazy? It looks like a blanket.

488
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:08.530
Are you going to leave like that?

489
00:29:08.897 --> 00:29:10.766
Why? What's wrong?

490
00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:12.934
I want to look as pitiful as possible,

491
00:29:12.934 --> 00:29:15.504
so that he'd feel sorry for me.

492
00:29:15.504 --> 00:29:18.206
Get a hold of yourself.

493
00:29:18.206 --> 00:29:20.041
If he were going to feel sorry for you,

494
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:21.910
he wouldn't have gotten a divorce.

495
00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:23.945
There's a famous saying,

496
00:29:23.945 --> 00:29:26.648
"beautifully divorced."

497
00:29:26.648 --> 00:29:29.184
You should look more beautiful than ever,

498
00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:31.887
so that he would regret having dumped you.

499
00:29:31.887 --> 00:29:32.988
Follow me.

500
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:34.222
Where to?

501
00:29:34.222 --> 00:29:37.793
I will give you an upgrade.

502
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:51.039
Are you going to go like this?

503
00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:52.841
Why does it matter?

504
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:54.776
I'm just going to meet Yeon Ju and sign the papers.

505
00:29:54.776 --> 00:29:57.746
You must be out of your mind.

506
00:29:57.746 --> 00:29:59.247
You can't.

507
00:29:59.781 --> 00:30:03.552
People should look beautiful when they leave.

508
00:30:03.552 --> 00:30:07.022
You guys are parting now. If you go looking shabby like this,

509
00:30:07.022 --> 00:30:09.691
Yeon Ju and her mom will be so happy...

510
00:30:09.691 --> 00:30:11.993
that they got rid of such a lowly person.

511
00:30:11.993 --> 00:30:13.995
Why does that even matter?

512
00:30:14.763 --> 00:30:16.198
We're going to be strangers now.

513
00:30:16.198 --> 00:30:18.767
A man is all about his pride.

514
00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:20.502
To others' eyes,

515
00:30:20.502 --> 00:30:22.304
it's looks better when...

516
00:30:22.304 --> 00:30:24.973
you're the one that dumped Yeon Ju, not the other way around.

517
00:30:25.707 --> 00:30:28.143
So, on a day like this,

518
00:30:28.143 --> 00:30:30.378
you need to be at your best.

519
00:30:31.046 --> 00:30:32.113
Let's go.

520
00:30:32.113 --> 00:30:33.281
Where to?

521
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:34.716
Where do you think?

522
00:30:34.716 --> 00:30:37.652
I need to make you look good for this.

523
00:30:40.856 --> 00:30:42.290
Let's go.

524
00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:48.530
Gosh, you're my daughter, but you're so pretty.

525
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.132
Gosh, that crazy scum.

526
00:30:51.132 --> 00:30:54.469
He'll be sorry he dumped you.

527
00:30:55.003 --> 00:30:56.504
You're so pretty.

528
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:00.942
Gosh.

529
00:31:01.476 --> 00:31:03.912
You're handsome just like me.

530
00:31:06.348 --> 00:31:09.885
Yeon Ju's eyes will pop out when she sees you.

531
00:31:10.986 --> 00:31:13.221
She left my precious son...

532
00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:15.991
just because of a child.

533
00:31:16.591 --> 00:31:18.026
Gosh.

534
00:31:18.026 --> 00:31:19.461
(Court)

535
00:31:38.914 --> 00:31:40.415
Mom.

536
00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:42.384
It's So Won.

537
00:31:55.463 --> 00:31:57.732
Gosh, he's so handsome.

538
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.802
He's so my type.

539
00:32:00.802 --> 00:32:03.805
Get a hold of yourself.

540
00:32:03.805 --> 00:32:05.941
He's a boy,

541
00:32:05.941 --> 00:32:09.210
and yet he's just like his mother with a pale face.

542
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.212
He looks like dumplings that have only been half eaten.

543
00:32:11.212 --> 00:32:12.914
Dad, it's Yeon Ju.

544
00:32:14.416 --> 00:32:15.417
Get a hold of yourself.

545
00:32:15.417 --> 00:32:17.919
This is not a fashion show.

546
00:32:18.053 --> 00:32:20.488
She spends so much money ignorantly.

547
00:32:22.424 --> 00:32:25.193
You don't need to feel small. You should look confident.

548
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.404
Hello, Mrs. Yang.

549
00:32:36.905 --> 00:32:40.075
I shouldn't even call you by your name from now on.

550
00:32:40.241 --> 00:32:41.242
Hello,

551
00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:43.545
grandma with a red hat.

552
00:32:45.046 --> 00:32:48.283
So you're making rude remarks now that we're strangers?

553
00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:51.953
Hello, unemployed man.

554
00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:55.190
It seems like your son...

555
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.225
is not yet fully grown up.

556
00:32:57.492 --> 00:33:00.662
He's getting divorced, and yet he brought his dad.

557
00:33:00.762 --> 00:33:02.764
Same to you.

558
00:33:03.365 --> 00:33:07.235
I knew you had control over her,

559
00:33:07.602 --> 00:33:09.704
but I didn't know you'd even follow her here.

560
00:33:09.704 --> 00:33:11.773
It's so embarrassing.

561
00:33:11.773 --> 00:33:14.275
Gosh, I was going to say goodbye politely...

562
00:33:14.275 --> 00:33:16.711
as we used to get along fine in the past.

563
00:33:16.711 --> 00:33:20.015
Gosh, you're not helping me at all.

564
00:33:20.281 --> 00:33:22.617
If we keep talking,

565
00:33:22.617 --> 00:33:24.753
we'll just get more offended.

566
00:33:24.953 --> 00:33:27.422
Let's just sign the papers quickly.

567
00:33:29.024 --> 00:33:30.225
So Won, did you hear that?

568
00:33:30.692 --> 00:33:32.060
Go sign the papers.

569
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:35.530
Let's end this tiring relationship...

570
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.798
as soon as possible.

571
00:33:40.635 --> 00:33:43.705
Lee So Won and Ha Yeon Ju. Please prepare your IDs.

572
00:33:55.617 --> 00:33:56.951
Please wait for a moment.

573
00:33:58.219 --> 00:34:01.022
You look so excited.

574
00:34:01.022 --> 00:34:02.457
You even changed your hairstyle.

575
00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:04.492
You look at least 10 years younger.

576
00:34:04.526 --> 00:34:07.929
Your hair always looked like an old man when you lived with me.

577
00:34:07.929 --> 00:34:09.064
Of course.

578
00:34:09.397 --> 00:34:12.300
I look better because I escaped from the underworld.

579
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:14.335
What, underworld?

580
00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.405
I was the one living with the devil who only cared about money.

581
00:34:17.405 --> 00:34:21.176
I still cry blood tears from thinking how you deceived me.

582
00:34:21.176 --> 00:34:24.546
Why do you have circle lenses on when you're crying blood tears?

583
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.083
You're desperately doing your best to look young.

584
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:29.250
Of course.

585
00:34:29.384 --> 00:34:31.419
And these are colored lenses.

586
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.323
I'm going to find a proper man since I'm single again.

587
00:34:35.457 --> 00:34:37.525
I don't have a child like someone.

588
00:34:37.826 --> 00:34:39.594
Good for you.

589
00:34:40.562 --> 00:34:43.164
Don't be too clingy from the start this time.

590
00:34:43.364 --> 00:34:45.133
That man will also get tired of you...

591
00:34:45.133 --> 00:34:47.035
like me even before the relationship begins.

592
00:34:47.302 --> 00:34:48.436
How dare you.

593
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.738
I heard that you used to be a delinquent.

594
00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:53.041
Break out of this habit.

595
00:34:53.041 --> 00:34:55.543
Let go of me.

596
00:34:56.211 --> 00:34:57.278
Excuse me?

597
00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:59.314
Your documents are registered.

598
00:35:07.422 --> 00:35:09.924
The ruling is after one month. Don't forget the date.

599
00:35:10.225 --> 00:35:11.793
Don't be clingy.

600
00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.265
Did you hear that?

601
00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:20.301
Let's just end this tiring relationship at once.

602
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.442
Why are you looking at them like you're sad?

603
00:35:28.243 --> 00:35:30.345
They're still rude.

604
00:35:31.513 --> 00:35:33.148
It's hard to fall out of love.

605
00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:37.485
Yeon Ju's face looks all pinched and drawn.

606
00:35:37.652 --> 00:35:39.621
Pinched and drawn?

607
00:35:39.621 --> 00:35:41.189
She looks like she couldn't be happier.

608
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.659
They're vulgar, and they only have a lot of money.

609
00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:46.628
Did they really have to show off their money here?

610
00:35:47.262 --> 00:35:49.230
Don't be discouraged.

611
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.666
We're still above them.

612
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.171
They're decked with luxurious goods, but they're stupid.

613
00:35:56.471 --> 00:35:59.374
My ears hurt from the sound of their empty heads trying to work.

614
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:03.878
You're an intelligent real man.

615
00:36:04.846 --> 00:36:05.980
You are intelligent and sexy.

616
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:08.183
Do you understand?

617
00:36:12.053 --> 00:36:14.589
Don't look back.

618
00:36:14.722 --> 00:36:16.724
It's true that So Won became more handsome...

619
00:36:16.724 --> 00:36:18.760
after changing his hairstyle.

620
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.595
Handsome, my foot.

621
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:22.530
That's why I came with you.

622
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.366
Father and son were...

623
00:36:25.366 --> 00:36:27.669
both acting like snobs.

624
00:36:27.802 --> 00:36:31.706
They probably bought those at a 50 percent discounted price.

625
00:36:31.806 --> 00:36:33.775
They looked so poor.

626
00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:35.176
Look at us.

627
00:36:35.176 --> 00:36:37.111
We're perfectly dressed...

628
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:39.814
from head to toe in Gangnam style.

629
00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:42.750
We are Gangnam style

630
00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:44.586
I feel so good. Let's go.

631
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.762
My sister made it clear.

632
00:36:55.263 --> 00:36:58.299
She never had nor gave birth to your child.

633
00:36:58.533 --> 00:37:00.068
She denied it.

634
00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:02.337
Your son doesn't exist in this world.

635
00:37:13.948 --> 00:37:15.149
Did you ask for me, sir?

636
00:37:15.617 --> 00:37:17.585
There's only one way left to find...

637
00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:19.254
my son.

638
00:37:20.021 --> 00:37:24.125
Find out everything about Jung Hwa Young's family background.

639
00:37:24.692 --> 00:37:25.793
Yes, sir.

640
00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:27.629
I'll find everything.

641
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:32.634
This is ridiculous.

642
00:37:33.134 --> 00:37:36.004
I can't believe that Jung Tae Yang is Chairman Kevin's son.

643
00:37:36.204 --> 00:37:38.606
Everything has become futile.

644
00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:40.475
Are you giving up?

645
00:37:40.475 --> 00:37:41.709
Are you crazy?

646
00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:45.713
If Chairman Kevin finds out about this,

647
00:37:45.747 --> 00:37:47.649
he'll try to turn the company over to his son.

648
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:49.984
He won't care about Jung Do when he joins the company.

649
00:37:50.051 --> 00:37:51.686
What should I do?

650
00:37:51.886 --> 00:37:55.423
The Chairman doesn't know about Jung Tae Yang yet.

651
00:37:55.657 --> 00:37:56.858
It's only a matter of time.

652
00:37:57.925 --> 00:38:01.229
Jung Hwa Young and Kevin will find out everything soon.

653
00:38:01.462 --> 00:38:03.398
Even if they find out, it won't be a problem.

654
00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:06.834
Jung Hwa Young wants to hide her son from Kevin to the end.

655
00:38:06.968 --> 00:38:09.837
Even if that's true, she'll be persuaded by the money.

656
00:38:13.474 --> 00:38:16.744
I forgot. I'll do this.

657
00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:21.115
I figured out how I will handle this.

658
00:38:21.115 --> 00:38:22.317
Get my car ready.

659
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.085
Okay, ma'am.

660
00:38:29.223 --> 00:38:30.525
What happened?

661
00:38:30.792 --> 00:38:33.494
Why didn't you return to Japan yet?

662
00:38:33.594 --> 00:38:36.297
I delayed my schedule because of you.

663
00:38:36.864 --> 00:38:39.567
I was thinking whether I should tell you this or not.

664
00:38:40.768 --> 00:38:42.337
I decided that it would be better to tell you.

665
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.072
What do you want to tell me?

666
00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:48.810
I met...

667
00:38:49.677 --> 00:38:52.113
your ex-husband Jay,

668
00:38:53.881 --> 00:38:55.283
no, it's Kevin now.

669
00:38:55.616 --> 00:38:56.684
What?

670
00:38:59.821 --> 00:39:01.589
Why did you meet him?

671
00:39:01.656 --> 00:39:03.224
It was for you.

672
00:39:03.324 --> 00:39:06.627
If I didn't meet him, I thought he would harass you.

673
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:09.163
What did he say?

674
00:39:10.131 --> 00:39:12.400
I'm sure that he asked whether he had a son or not.

675
00:39:12.467 --> 00:39:14.936
Did you tell him the truth?

676
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.405
If you did,

677
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.575
I'll never see you again.

678
00:39:21.676 --> 00:39:24.045
Hwa Young.

679
00:39:24.312 --> 00:39:26.614
Do you hate Kevin that much?

680
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:27.749
Are you serious?

681
00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:29.817
He ruined my life.

682
00:39:30.151 --> 00:39:31.819
I could talk all night...

683
00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:33.488
about the hardships I went through after Tae Yang was born.

684
00:39:34.222 --> 00:39:37.091
You don't know how much I cursed him and hated him.

685
00:39:37.692 --> 00:39:41.129
Tae Yang obviously went through those hardships with you.

686
00:39:41.195 --> 00:39:42.330
Of course.

687
00:39:44.499 --> 00:39:45.800
I start crying...

688
00:39:47.902 --> 00:39:49.170
whenever I talk about him.

689
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:51.339
He grew up so pitifully.

690
00:39:52.573 --> 00:39:54.609
He had a hard time economically,

691
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.979
but Woo Joo's Dad also gave him a hard time.

692
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.815
That's why I'm saying this.

693
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:04.752
Can't you forgive Kevin?

694
00:40:05.219 --> 00:40:06.320
Sarah.

695
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.190
It's not for you, it's for Tae Yang.

696
00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:13.294
Can't you tell him the identity of his father and let them meet?

697
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:15.096
How many more times should I tell you to make you understand?

698
00:40:15.096 --> 00:40:16.764
He's an alcoholic.

699
00:40:16.764 --> 00:40:19.534
Does my child also have to go through that pain?

700
00:40:19.534 --> 00:40:20.735
He has changed.

701
00:40:20.902 --> 00:40:22.670
I also saw that he became successful...

702
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.672
with my own eyes.

703
00:40:25.173 --> 00:40:26.607
He's rich,

704
00:40:26.974 --> 00:40:28.709
and he really wants to see his son.

705
00:40:28.943 --> 00:40:31.112
He worked hard and became successful...

706
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:33.147
to ask for the forgiveness from you and your child.

707
00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:35.550
I could sense his sincerity.

708
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:39.587
Do you want me to send my son to that man...

709
00:40:40.221 --> 00:40:42.323
for money?

710
00:40:42.323 --> 00:40:43.858
Let's be realistic.

711
00:40:44.492 --> 00:40:46.027
With that wealth,

712
00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:49.530
you could secure a bright future...

713
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:51.399
for Tae Yang, who had a hard time growing up.

714
00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:53.701
He doesn't have to be a cook.

715
00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:55.903
He can do whatever he wants and achieve whatever he wants...

716
00:40:55.903 --> 00:40:57.705
and enjoy life.

717
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.107
It doesn't matter.

718
00:41:01.476 --> 00:41:04.278
He'll become that trash-like human again with a drop of alcohol.

719
00:41:04.846 --> 00:41:07.148
I don't want to hurt my child for some money.

720
00:41:07.515 --> 00:41:10.751
I don't want to hear this tiring story again. Just leave.

721
00:41:10.785 --> 00:41:13.087
Do you know about SC Food and Beverage?

722
00:41:15.923 --> 00:41:17.024
What about it?

723
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:20.361
Kevin is the chairman of that company.

724
00:41:23.364 --> 00:41:24.532
What?

725
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.934
What did you just say?

726
00:41:27.134 --> 00:41:30.037
He changed his name to Kevin Miller.

727
00:41:30.037 --> 00:41:31.239
No, not that thing.

728
00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:35.810
What's his company?

729
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:39.614
Is he really the chairman of SC Food and Beverage?

730
00:41:40.114 --> 00:41:42.116
- Is that right? - Yes, it is.

731
00:41:42.116 --> 00:41:45.486
I went to the company and saw it with my own eyes.

732
00:41:48.122 --> 00:41:49.357
That's impossible.

733
00:41:49.991 --> 00:41:52.393
This is really impossible.

734
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:54.762
- Sarah. - What's wrong?

735
00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:58.533
Tae Yang...

736
00:42:00.401 --> 00:42:01.936
works there.

737
00:42:02.904 --> 00:42:04.071
What?

738
00:42:07.074 --> 00:42:08.609
Here. This is the snack for the day.

739
00:42:09.477 --> 00:42:10.611
This is it?

740
00:42:10.845 --> 00:42:13.881
You told us not to eat instant food. Why did you make us tteok ramyeon?

741
00:42:21.022 --> 00:42:23.257
Yes, Dean. How did it go?

742
00:42:25.259 --> 00:42:26.961
Really?

743
00:42:28.262 --> 00:42:30.565
There's no choice. I'm okay.

744
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:34.435
Thank you for getting through all that trouble.

745
00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:41.075
Star chef? You must be kidding me.

746
00:42:42.743 --> 00:42:45.146
Dad, didn't you become a full-time professor?

747
00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:46.514
It's obvious.

748
00:42:46.514 --> 00:42:48.616
He mentioned "Star chef".

749
00:42:48.616 --> 00:42:51.285
A chef who is on TV a lot must have become a full-time professor.

750
00:42:51.285 --> 00:42:53.921
Mom must be disappointed. She was really looking forward to it.

751
00:42:54.422 --> 00:42:56.023
She said that you would become a professor.

752
00:42:58.192 --> 00:42:59.360
Don't worry.

753
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.996
I actually didn't want to become a professor.

754
00:43:02.229 --> 00:43:04.398
I wanted to spend more time with you.

755
00:43:07.134 --> 00:43:09.103
Dad, that's sad.

756
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.505
As long as you're happy. Dad, cheer up!

757
00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.941
Okay, thank you. Let's do it.

758
00:43:17.445 --> 00:43:18.546
Is it Mom?

759
00:43:20.514 --> 00:43:21.649
Eat up.

760
00:43:25.319 --> 00:43:26.854
Eun Byul, how are you?

761
00:43:30.091 --> 00:43:31.525
What is it this time?

762
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.199
I need to speak to you alone.

763
00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:39.400
Let's go outside.

764
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.801
You can tell me here.

765
00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:43.571
I don't want to look at your face.

766
00:43:43.571 --> 00:43:44.605
Really?

767
00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:48.342
I was going to tell you about Jung Hwa Young's past.

768
00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:51.045
Should I tell you in front of your children?

769
00:43:52.013 --> 00:43:53.114
Follow me.

770
00:44:00.154 --> 00:44:02.323
You said you'll trust me no matter what.

771
00:44:02.323 --> 00:44:04.525
I don't care even if you say it's out of inferiority.

772
00:44:05.259 --> 00:44:07.261
I can't go through...

773
00:44:07.261 --> 00:44:09.864
what Myung Tae did to me ever again.

774
00:44:10.364 --> 00:44:12.199
I can't do that.

775
00:44:12.199 --> 00:44:14.669
I'd rather end it here now.

776
00:44:15.202 --> 00:44:18.606
I'm not your assistant anymore.

777
00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:21.275
You don't need to intervene too much.

778
00:44:21.575 --> 00:44:24.845
I'll become a regular employee on my own without your help.

779
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:45.533
Yes, Mom. What is it?

780
00:44:45.533 --> 00:44:48.436
Tae Yang, can I talk to you for a moment?

781
00:44:48.903 --> 00:44:50.805
I want to ask you something.

782
00:44:50.805 --> 00:44:52.173
Yes? Go ahead.

783
00:44:52.173 --> 00:44:55.342
Who's the chairman of your company,

784
00:44:55.342 --> 00:44:57.011
SC Food and Beverage?

785
00:44:57.578 --> 00:44:58.646
Kevin Miller.

786
00:44:59.213 --> 00:45:00.481
Why do you ask?

787
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.486
Have you met him?

788
00:45:05.553 --> 00:45:08.322
Of course. Didn't I tell you about him?

789
00:45:08.322 --> 00:45:09.724
We're quite close.

790
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.327
He likes me so much,

791
00:45:13.327 --> 00:45:14.795
saying I'm like a son to him.

792
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:20.401
Have you ever taken...

793
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:22.503
a picture with him?

794
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:23.971
I'm just asking.

795
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:27.475
I want to know what the chairman that takes care of you looks like.

796
00:45:27.675 --> 00:45:29.844
That's so random.

797
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:31.879
Just wait a moment.

798
00:45:51.766 --> 00:45:53.501
He'll get to know.

799
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:55.603
Just tell him as soon as possible.

800
00:46:08.082 --> 00:46:10.751
You're living with a criminal...

801
00:46:10.751 --> 00:46:12.620
who tried to kill her ex-husband.

802
00:46:19.093 --> 00:46:20.494
So what?

803
00:46:21.228 --> 00:46:24.765
Are you going to threaten me to break up with her?

804
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.935
It's all over.

805
00:46:28.302 --> 00:46:30.805
We know that her husband is alive.

806
00:46:30.805 --> 00:46:34.074
I already know that.

807
00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:36.510
I know who he is.

808
00:46:38.245 --> 00:46:39.513
What do you mean?

809
00:46:40.014 --> 00:46:41.749
How would you know?

810
00:46:41.749 --> 00:46:44.585
What do you mean? I'm close to him.

811
00:46:45.152 --> 00:46:47.321
I meet him every day.

812
00:46:47.655 --> 00:46:48.823
What?

813
00:46:49.089 --> 00:46:50.457
Kevin Miller.

814
00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:52.793
The Chairman of SC Food and Beverage.

815
00:46:53.661 --> 00:46:56.630
He's the father of Jung Tae Yang.

816
00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:02.570
Jung Do, I came here today,

817
00:47:03.537 --> 00:47:06.273
not to make you leave Jung Hwa Young,

818
00:47:06.473 --> 00:47:09.109
but to make sure she doesn't leave you.

819
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:10.611
I was worried about you.

820
00:47:12.446 --> 00:47:14.882
What do you mean? Why would she leave me?

821
00:47:14.882 --> 00:47:16.417
I told you...

822
00:47:16.784 --> 00:47:19.186
that money is the most valuable thing in the world.

823
00:47:19.453 --> 00:47:21.088
You can do anything with money.

824
00:47:21.655 --> 00:47:24.425
She might have tried to kill him once,

825
00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:26.493
but she could change her mind...

826
00:47:26.493 --> 00:47:28.028
after realizing that he is rich.

827
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:31.932
I'm sorry,

828
00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:35.202
but Jung Hwa Young is not a trash like you.

829
00:47:35.202 --> 00:47:38.205
No, I only speak of the truth.

830
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.075
If you want to live with her,

831
00:47:41.075 --> 00:47:42.610
do as I tell you.

832
00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:45.479
Get rid of Jung Tae Yang from SC Food and Beverage.

833
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.861
Why are you standing here like this?

834
00:48:00.861 --> 00:48:03.731
Grandmother is on the second floor.

835
00:48:04.098 --> 00:48:05.299
What?

836
00:48:07.902 --> 00:48:10.604
I trust her.

837
00:48:11.472 --> 00:48:14.942
The situation that you worry about will never happen.

838
00:48:15.943 --> 00:48:17.544
Get out of here.

839
00:48:18.012 --> 00:48:19.813
You shouldn't trust her.

840
00:48:21.382 --> 00:48:24.084
She'll find out about Kevin soon enough.

841
00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:28.422
Her sister came to meet Kevin yesterday...

842
00:48:28.422 --> 00:48:29.523
to the company.

843
00:48:29.924 --> 00:48:31.926
She'll find out about this...

844
00:48:31.926 --> 00:48:33.394
in a few days.

845
00:48:37.531 --> 00:48:40.301
My sister wanted to see me to talk about something important.

846
00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:47.641
Get out. Get out of here!

847
00:48:47.641 --> 00:48:48.709
Go Jung Do!

848
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.413
You're nothing next to Chairman Kevin.

849
00:48:53.614 --> 00:48:55.149
Do you need me to tell you this?

850
00:48:55.282 --> 00:48:57.051
Who do you think would win...

851
00:48:57.051 --> 00:48:59.853
if a part-time lecturer fights with a millionaire?

852
00:49:01.155 --> 00:49:04.191
And she'd be able to go and live in a penthouse...

853
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:06.460
- from this little house. - Shut your mouth!

854
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.395
Get out. Get out!

855
00:49:11.632 --> 00:49:14.401
Oh, my. I was just about to leave.

856
00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:16.470
You came just in time.

857
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.505
Get out of my house.

858
00:49:27.982 --> 00:49:29.750
Don't forget what I said.

859
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.319
This is for your own good.

860
00:49:43.964 --> 00:49:45.399
Why did she come here again?

861
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.502
The children told me that she mentioned my past again.

862
00:49:48.869 --> 00:49:52.239
Yes, but you don't need to worry. It was nothing.

863
00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.275
By the way,

864
00:49:56.844 --> 00:49:59.380
did you meet your sister?

865
00:50:00.114 --> 00:50:02.149
You said it was about something important.

866
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:04.284
What was it about?

867
00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:07.821
Well... It was nothing special.

868
00:50:08.222 --> 00:50:10.457
She just wanted to meet me again.

869
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:12.893
I'm going to take a shower.

870
00:50:13.327 --> 00:50:14.395
Wait.

871
00:50:15.462 --> 00:50:16.497
What is it?

872
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.934
It's nothing.

873
00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:04.044
We're going to have a remind wedding today.

874
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:08.082
You've been causing trouble talking about marriage graduation,

875
00:51:08.082 --> 00:51:11.985
but I want to thank you for deciding to stay next to me.

876
00:51:19.193 --> 00:51:23.030
Grandma, don't you like Grandpa?

877
00:51:23.197 --> 00:51:24.298
What?

878
00:51:25.032 --> 00:51:26.200
Why?

879
00:51:26.967 --> 00:51:30.804
That's what he bought you.

880
00:51:30.804 --> 00:51:32.940
But you never wear it.

881
00:51:34.575 --> 00:51:37.644
You don't seem to miss anything.

882
00:51:41.782 --> 00:51:42.816
What?

883
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.384
It's strange.

884
00:51:44.384 --> 00:51:46.553
You live together.

885
00:51:46.553 --> 00:51:48.455
Why do you not like him?

886
00:51:51.592 --> 00:51:52.860
I don't know.

887
00:51:53.827 --> 00:51:56.330
I liked him at first, so I lived with him.

888
00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.765
But as time passed, my feelings changed.

889
00:51:59.133 --> 00:52:01.935
Just like Dad and his wife?

890
00:52:06.039 --> 00:52:07.841
I have to go somewhere.

891
00:52:07.841 --> 00:52:10.611
Do you want to go with me too?

892
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:14.882
All right. Let's go together.

893
00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:22.823
In this village, there are new buildings.

894
00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:25.492
They are all clean and not too expensive.

895
00:52:25.492 --> 00:52:26.827
You should take a look.

896
00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:30.264
All right. If I like it, I'll sign the contract today.

897
00:52:30.264 --> 00:52:32.666
All right.

898
00:52:35.903 --> 00:52:38.839
Han Gyul. Han Gyul, don't sleep.

899
00:52:39.072 --> 00:52:40.807
I'm finished.

900
00:52:40.807 --> 00:52:44.044
On the way home, I'll buy you the cake that you like.

901
00:52:44.344 --> 00:52:46.380
Is it someone's birthday today?

902
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.548
Well,

903
00:52:48.348 --> 00:52:50.317
it's more special than that.

904
00:52:50.884 --> 00:52:54.421
Your aunt has become a regular employee at her company.

905
00:52:54.555 --> 00:52:56.757
My aunt is the best!

906
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.435
You should try it.

907
00:53:08.502 --> 00:53:10.437
This is a black tea that is hard to come by.

908
00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:16.343
It has a unique smell.

909
00:53:17.578 --> 00:53:19.213
It smells like orchid.

910
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.249
I knew you'd like it.

911
00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:29.456
Did you call me, Chairman?

912
00:53:29.823 --> 00:53:31.124
I called him.

913
00:53:31.325 --> 00:53:33.727
You feel better when you see him.

914
00:53:34.828 --> 00:53:36.697
Have a seat. I was actually going to...

915
00:53:36.697 --> 00:53:37.898
treat you to a meal to thank you.

916
00:53:42.669 --> 00:53:43.804
What do you mean?

917
00:53:43.804 --> 00:53:47.107
I heard you helped Ae Ri when she hurt her ankle.

918
00:53:48.342 --> 00:53:50.611
Since you carried a grown woman to a hospital,

919
00:53:50.611 --> 00:53:52.112
you must be responsible for her.

920
00:53:52.779 --> 00:53:54.047
Dad, come on.

921
00:53:56.049 --> 00:53:57.918
Anyway, thank you for everything.

922
00:53:58.285 --> 00:54:00.487
Ae Ri changed since she met you.

923
00:54:00.887 --> 00:54:03.023
She even got this nice tea for her dad.

924
00:54:03.724 --> 00:54:08.028
People change depending on whom they meet.

925
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:10.163
Not at all.

926
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.568
Chairman, I...

927
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.338
Excuse me.

928
00:54:20.941 --> 00:54:22.075
What is it?

929
00:54:22.142 --> 00:54:23.510
Meet me now.

930
00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:25.912
I'm busy. Say it over the phone.

931
00:54:26.246 --> 00:54:27.648
Do you know Lee Jung Sik?

932
00:54:30.117 --> 00:54:31.318
Where are you?

933
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.488
Okay. Wait there.

934
00:54:38.325 --> 00:54:40.761
Enjoy the tea with Tae Yang, Dad.

935
00:54:40.761 --> 00:54:42.763
Something came up in the office.

936
00:54:43.597 --> 00:54:44.731
What's wrong?

937
00:54:45.899 --> 00:54:48.635
You should make my dad happy.

938
00:54:49.136 --> 00:54:50.337
I'll be right back.

939
00:55:00.981 --> 00:55:02.249
Look at this, Manager Jung.

940
00:55:04.284 --> 00:55:07.154
The pork is from Korea. Why does it say that it's from Chile?

941
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.090
- Did the print shop make a mistake? - That can't be.

942
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:13.193
I checked with my own eyes there.

943
00:55:13.193 --> 00:55:14.628
It's not the time for this.

944
00:55:14.961 --> 00:55:16.763
It's already spread everywhere.

945
00:55:16.763 --> 00:55:17.898
We need to take care of this.

946
00:55:28.675 --> 00:55:30.610
Why did you want to see me?

947
00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:31.778
Have a seat.

948
00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:33.780
It's going to take long.

949
00:55:33.947 --> 00:55:36.650
I don't have time for that. Make it brief.

950
00:55:36.883 --> 00:55:40.153
Hey. You better sit down.

951
00:55:40.387 --> 00:55:43.357
You must've rushed to get here since you know Lee Jung Sik.

952
00:55:43.824 --> 00:55:45.525
Stay out of this.

953
00:55:48.562 --> 00:55:49.830
Who is Lee Jung Sik?

954
00:55:50.197 --> 00:55:51.531
You forgot already?

955
00:55:52.899 --> 00:55:55.902
He remembers your name clearly.

956
00:55:56.269 --> 00:55:58.839
You bribed him...

957
00:55:59.239 --> 00:56:01.508
to switch posters.

958
00:56:02.509 --> 00:56:03.643
Lee Ru Ri.

959
00:56:04.511 --> 00:56:07.481
I thought you're only incompetent, but you're also cunning.

960
00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:09.583
Are you trying to...

961
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.753
put the blame on me because you didn't become a regular employee?

962
00:56:14.054 --> 00:56:16.189
Do you think I'd fall for that?

963
00:56:18.592 --> 00:56:20.527
You witch.

964
00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.563
Hey. You're the one who tricked us.

965
00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:25.866
You paid the man in the printing shop...

966
00:56:25.866 --> 00:56:27.801
to print the wrong poster.

967
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:29.102
That's not all.

968
00:56:29.169 --> 00:56:31.905
It's you who stabbed us in the back...

969
00:56:31.905 --> 00:56:33.440
by changing 22 servings into 2.

970
00:56:35.175 --> 00:56:37.110
I see how close you are,

971
00:56:37.611 --> 00:56:38.712
but do you have evidence?

972
00:56:38.745 --> 00:56:41.148
Who would listen to you...

973
00:56:41.448 --> 00:56:43.784
if you accuse me without evidence?

974
00:56:44.618 --> 00:56:46.219
I'm the daughter of the chairman,

975
00:56:46.219 --> 00:56:48.855
and you're only an intern and a contract employee.

976
00:56:48.922 --> 00:56:51.124
Know your position before you act up.

977
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.295
Joo Ae Ri made me do it.

978
00:56:55.929 --> 00:56:58.365
She told me to switch the new menu poster.

979
00:56:58.598 --> 00:57:00.167
She didn't even pay me a lot.

980
00:57:01.101 --> 00:57:03.203
She came to me first.

981
00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:04.938
What's the reason?

982
00:57:05.972 --> 00:57:07.841
Why would you spend money...

983
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:10.510
to stab a contract employee in the back twice?

984
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.915
You're not going to say it?

985
00:57:16.283 --> 00:57:17.317
Fine.

986
00:57:18.452 --> 00:57:22.155
I'll never have to see you again anyway.

987
00:57:22.289 --> 00:57:23.723
I don't need your reason.

988
00:57:25.158 --> 00:57:28.462
This is enough to fire you...

989
00:57:28.462 --> 00:57:30.297
even if you're the chairman's daughter.

990
00:57:31.765 --> 00:57:32.899
Isn't it funny?

991
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.535
We hate each other,

992
00:57:35.802 --> 00:57:37.737
but we have same taste in men.

993
00:57:39.739 --> 00:57:41.708
You want to know why I stabbed you in the back?

994
00:57:42.843 --> 00:57:44.544
I did that because I want Jung Tae Yang.

995
00:57:45.178 --> 00:57:47.113
You're not worth...

996
00:57:47.113 --> 00:57:48.748
for a man like him.

997
00:57:49.783 --> 00:57:52.586
Also, my dad is keeping his eyes on him.

998
00:57:52.886 --> 00:57:54.821
He'll only prosper if he marries me,

999
00:57:55.622 --> 00:57:58.425
but you kept getting in the way, so I removed the obstacle.

1000
00:58:02.863 --> 00:58:06.233
Lee Ru Ri. Let me give you advice.

1001
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.203
I'll never give up Jung Tae Yang.

1002
00:58:11.137 --> 00:58:14.207
You must be sad about the situation, but you shouldn't be.

1003
00:58:14.808 --> 00:58:18.211
It's a sin to meet someone who's not in your league.

1004
00:58:18.478 --> 00:58:20.914
So get out of my sight before you...

1005
00:58:25.285 --> 00:58:26.653
Good job, Myung Rang.

1006
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.656
Someone so crazy like her...

1007
00:58:29.656 --> 00:58:31.758
should get cold water splashed on her face to be sane.

1008
00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:33.460
Anytime.

1009
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.962
I'll sink you in Han River next time.

1010
00:58:36.696 --> 00:58:38.632
- How dare you! - You!

1011
00:58:42.135 --> 00:58:43.937
Let me give you advice.

1012
00:58:45.472 --> 00:58:47.474
If you like Jung Tae Yang so much,

1013
00:58:48.141 --> 00:58:50.277
don't try any stupid tricks like this.

1014
00:58:51.578 --> 00:58:53.213
As far as I know,

1015
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.815
he hates tricks like this.

1016
00:58:57.784 --> 00:59:01.755
Right. He wouldn't even hate you when he sees this...

1017
00:59:03.557 --> 00:59:06.526
because you're a helpless piece of garbage.

1018
00:59:08.995 --> 00:59:10.297
What's going on?

1019
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:17.404
What's wrong, Joo Ae Ri?

1020
00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:20.774
Those two are insane.

1021
00:59:21.241 --> 00:59:23.109
They poured water on me.

1022
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:25.011
How could they do this to me?

1023
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:27.647
Hey, witch. Stop putting on a show.

1024
00:59:28.515 --> 00:59:29.649
Stop it, Lee Myung Rang.

1025
00:59:30.884 --> 00:59:32.752
Explain this, Lee Ru Ri.

1026
00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.790
What caused this unbelievable situation in the office?

1027
00:59:37.424 --> 00:59:40.794
Yes. It's unbelievable.

1028
00:59:42.262 --> 00:59:44.664
But I'm ashamed to explain it.

1029
00:59:45.632 --> 00:59:48.902
I'll send you the video. You can check it yourself.

1030
00:59:49.669 --> 00:59:53.006
It'll explain why Joo Ae Ri's like that...

1031
00:59:53.573 --> 00:59:54.841
for me.

1032
00:59:58.612 --> 01:00:00.380
Ru Ri. Lee Ru Ri.

1033
01:00:14.461 --> 01:00:15.595
I feel so much better.

1034
01:00:16.596 --> 01:00:18.064
We could've done better though.

1035
01:00:18.331 --> 01:00:21.635
If we had kimchi, I could've slapped her with it like a drama.

1036
01:00:25.472 --> 01:00:27.841
Congratulations anyway, Ru Ri.

1037
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:31.277
What's left now is becoming a regular employee...

1038
01:00:31.344 --> 01:00:33.213
and a happy ending with Manager Jung.

1039
01:00:36.449 --> 01:00:37.684
What's wrong?

1040
01:00:37.951 --> 01:00:40.854
Why would you sigh instead of dancing when everything's solved?

1041
01:00:41.621 --> 01:00:43.523
- Myung Rang. - Yes?

1042
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:48.528
Should I give up on Manager Jung?

1043
01:00:50.864 --> 01:00:52.032
Are you crazy?

1044
01:00:54.134 --> 01:00:56.202
I'm losing confidence.

1045
01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:00.573
Just like what Joo Ae Ri said, evidence is useless.

1046
01:01:00.974 --> 01:01:03.510
The chairman's beautiful daughter...

1047
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.378
is flirting at him.

1048
01:01:06.012 --> 01:01:09.249
Manager Jung wouldn't be able to help it either.

1049
01:01:10.784 --> 01:01:12.852
I know it's tempting.

1050
01:01:13.286 --> 01:01:15.188
But he's different from Myung Tae.

1051
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:16.990
Trust him.

1052
01:01:18.825 --> 01:01:21.127
I know it's going to be hard.

1053
01:01:21.995 --> 01:01:24.064
I keep losing confidence.

1054
01:01:26.366 --> 01:01:30.070
Then how about dating a lacking boyfriend like mine?

1055
01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:31.504
Sung Tan has many friends.

1056
01:01:35.175 --> 01:01:36.342
I'd say no.

1057
01:01:36.743 --> 01:01:38.344
Right. I know.

1058
01:01:38.511 --> 01:01:40.914
- Thank you for today. - No problem.

1059
01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:43.583
- For loyalty. - For loyalty.

1060
01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:51.124
We're here.

1061
01:01:52.592 --> 01:01:53.960
Where are we?

1062
01:01:54.094 --> 01:01:55.228
You'll see.

1063
01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:58.998
Why do you think I followed you to the court?

1064
01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:01.935
That was to come here.

1065
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.210
("Splendid Single")

1066
01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:16.583
Marriage is crazy

1067
01:02:17.016 --> 01:02:20.453
I really think so

1068
01:02:21.054 --> 01:02:23.523
Why would you confine yourself...

1069
01:02:23.923 --> 01:02:26.359
in this great world

1070
01:02:26.359 --> 01:02:28.128
Wrong decision

1071
01:02:28.194 --> 01:02:31.097
I wouldn't like a divorce...

1072
01:02:31.097 --> 01:02:34.934
where we meet again as friends

1073
01:02:35.201 --> 01:02:38.671
You can always leave...

1074
01:02:38.872 --> 01:02:40.840
if you don't love me anymore

1075
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.375
Lack of patience

1076
01:02:43.476 --> 01:02:45.712
Everyone must be crazy

1077
01:02:45.712 --> 01:02:47.447
That must be it

1078
01:02:47.447 --> 01:02:50.450
Why would you hesitate

1079
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.552
Get lost, Lee So Won!

1080
01:02:52.719 --> 01:02:54.921
I'll get over you.

1081
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.723
You jerk!

1082
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:05.965
What do you think?

1083
01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.835
I took out a loan with my house as security.

1084
01:03:09.569 --> 01:03:12.572
Let's open a clinic here once I get the money.

1085
01:03:12.739 --> 01:03:16.142
Father. I don't want to owe you.

1086
01:03:16.442 --> 01:03:19.145
There's nothing like that between parents and children.

1087
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.083
I'm willing to sacrifice my heart for your success.

1088
01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:28.054
It's fine. I'll be a pay doctor in Suwon.

1089
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.355
No way.

1090
01:03:30.089 --> 01:03:32.959
You lost everything. You have to start rebuilding.

1091
01:03:33.259 --> 01:03:35.895
When will you succeed wasting four hours for commute?

1092
01:03:36.963 --> 01:03:40.500
Also, the clinic must be near home...

1093
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.502
for your mom to take care of Han Gyul.

1094
01:03:42.869 --> 01:03:44.404
This is perfect.

1095
01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.439
Just do as I say.

1096
01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:47.874
Father.

1097
01:03:49.475 --> 01:03:53.112
Forget about Yeon Ju,

1098
01:03:53.112 --> 01:03:54.647
and focus on work now.

1099
01:03:55.882 --> 01:03:58.084
I'll support you from now on...

1100
01:03:58.518 --> 01:04:00.587
instead of your in-law.

1101
01:04:04.691 --> 01:04:06.960
- Cheers. - Yes.

1102
01:04:08.862 --> 01:04:11.764
Are you okay now?

1103
01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:15.068
Yes, Mom. I love you.

1104
01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:16.903
And I'm sorry.

1105
01:04:16.903 --> 01:04:18.805
What are you sorry about?

1106
01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:22.075
I almost abandoned you...

1107
01:04:22.075 --> 01:04:24.344
for a man.

1108
01:04:24.344 --> 01:04:26.145
I'll never do that again.

1109
01:04:27.013 --> 01:04:28.381
I finally realized...

1110
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:31.517
the person I love the most in this world...

1111
01:04:31.517 --> 01:04:33.586
is you, Mom.

1112
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.488
Good.

1113
01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:39.192
Are you going to...

1114
01:04:39.192 --> 01:04:41.861
get over that jerk, Lee So Won?

1115
01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:43.596
Of course.

1116
01:04:43.596 --> 01:04:45.732
It's a new day tomorrow.

1117
01:04:46.199 --> 01:04:48.868
I'm starting a new life now.

1118
01:04:48.868 --> 01:04:52.972
I'll sing for you on that.

1119
01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:54.874
Music start.

1120
01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:57.143
("I'm a Gentleman")

1121
01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:03.149
Do you think you're proud because you're not divorced

1122
01:05:03.383 --> 01:05:07.420
My divorced daughter is also proud

1123
01:05:07.553 --> 01:05:11.758
I'm a gentleman

1124
01:05:11.925 --> 01:05:16.162
Do you think you're proud to have husbands

1125
01:05:16.195 --> 01:05:20.199
We're also proud without husbands

1126
01:05:20.199 --> 01:05:24.203
I'm a gentleman

1127
01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.875
What's the cake for?

1128
01:05:29.742 --> 01:05:33.546
Aunt became a real employee at her work today.

1129
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.981
Really?

1130
01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:37.750
Congratulations, Ru Ri. Blow out the candles.

1131
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:40.553
Thank you.

1132
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.356
Let's blow them together, Han Gyul.

1133
01:05:43.923 --> 01:05:45.692
1, 2, 3.

1134
01:05:45.992 --> 01:05:48.861
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1135
01:05:49.329 --> 01:05:50.964
Congratulations.

1136
01:05:52.432 --> 01:05:54.100
It's great.

1137
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.235
My stupid daughter hit a home run.

1138
01:05:58.638 --> 01:06:01.841
Hey, So Won. Like I said before,

1139
01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:03.910
don't ever be discouraged.

1140
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:06.980
Divorce may have been a disgrace in the past,

1141
01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.381
but people live for 100 years now.

1142
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.783
It's a torture to live with just one person now.

1143
01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:14.988
He's right, So Won.

1144
01:06:15.321 --> 01:06:17.657
Since things turned out to be this way,

1145
01:06:17.657 --> 01:06:20.126
you should focus on your new life.

1146
01:06:20.493 --> 01:06:23.262
Of course. That's how it should be.

1147
01:06:23.262 --> 01:06:26.199
Divorce is not a failure, but another choice.

1148
01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:27.867
It's the second chapter of life.

1149
01:06:27.867 --> 01:06:29.502
It's also a trend.

1150
01:06:30.136 --> 01:06:33.339
Celebrities, conglomerates, and even the US president.

1151
01:06:33.339 --> 01:06:36.075
Everyone's getting divorced.

1152
01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.011
It's not something you should be ashamed of.

1153
01:06:38.011 --> 01:06:40.146
It's rather like a blessing.

1154
01:06:41.481 --> 01:06:43.416
Do you really mean it?

1155
01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:45.918
Divorce is not a failure,

1156
01:06:45.918 --> 01:06:48.554
but another choice...

1157
01:06:48.888 --> 01:06:50.189
and a blessing?

1158
01:06:50.189 --> 01:06:52.692
Of course.

1159
01:06:52.692 --> 01:06:56.062
It's uncomfortable when you don't wear the same pair of shoes.

1160
01:06:56.062 --> 01:06:57.864
It's worse with your partner.

1161
01:06:58.464 --> 01:07:01.734
It's best for you to split if it doesn't work out.

1162
01:07:03.469 --> 01:07:06.572
Right? I agree.

1163
01:07:07.407 --> 01:07:11.210
It's been a while since our opinions matched.

1164
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:12.979
What's going on, Ms. Hong?

1165
01:07:12.979 --> 01:07:16.282
You always upset me with your stupid logic.

1166
01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:17.483
Are you back to yourself now?

1167
01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:21.154
I've been back to myself for long.

1168
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:25.024
You made it easier for me to say it...

1169
01:07:25.491 --> 01:07:28.094
by saying that to So Won today.

1170
01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:31.631
What? What is it?

1171
01:07:34.033 --> 01:07:36.502
What is it? Say it.

1172
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.208
Lee Shin Mo.

1173
01:07:43.242 --> 01:07:46.145
Let's get blessed.

1174
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:52.418
Blessed? What blessing?

1175
01:07:52.418 --> 01:07:55.555
A blessing to break up with someone not meant for you.

1176
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:06.232
Are you joking?

1177
01:08:06.466 --> 01:08:07.934
I'm not joking.

1178
01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:10.436
Let's divorce.

1179
01:08:11.704 --> 01:08:14.373
I'm so sick of you now.

1180
01:08:17.009 --> 01:08:18.244
I won't live with you.

1181
01:08:31.924 --> 01:08:33.259
Did you call me?

1182
01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:34.794
Close the door again.

1183
01:08:35.962 --> 01:08:38.064
Turn slowly, Han Gyul.

1184
01:08:38.264 --> 01:08:41.167
That's it. Great.

1185
01:08:41.901 --> 01:08:42.935
Hello.

1186
01:08:43.369 --> 01:08:44.904
Grandma with a red hat.

1187
01:08:46.772 --> 01:08:47.907
"Red hat."

1188
01:08:47.974 --> 01:08:49.308
Action.

1189
01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:51.844
I can't do it.

1190
01:08:52.311 --> 01:08:54.547
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1191
01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:57.350
I don't want to talk to you anymore. I'll see you in the court.

1192
01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:58.885
I trust you.

1193
01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.987
I love you

1194
01:09:00.987 --> 01:09:03.489
I think her mom is very rich.

1195
01:09:03.489 --> 01:09:04.924
Is she pretty?

1196
01:09:04.924 --> 01:09:06.726
How's your dad?

1197
01:09:06.726 --> 01:09:08.294
He said he doesn't feel like eating.

1198
01:09:08.294 --> 01:09:10.463
Why are you at my daughter's work?

1199
01:09:10.463 --> 01:09:11.898
You stalker!

1200
01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.000
Will you meet him if your father's alive?

1201
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.968
There must be a special tie.

1202
01:09:15.968 --> 01:09:17.970
Are you swayed by him?

1203
01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:20.473
Are you going back to your rich husband?

1204
01:09:20.473 --> 01:09:23.009
Jung Tae Yang's my son?
