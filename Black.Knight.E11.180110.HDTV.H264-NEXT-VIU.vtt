00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.380
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.219
This is Ms. Choi Seo Rin.

3
00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.319
I see.

4
00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.100
I inherited the land from my ancestors,

5
00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.400
but there was an error on the papers.

6
00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:35.570
Hello, I'm Choi Seo Rin.

7
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.800
You probably didn't know my name.

8
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.409
Hello, I am Moon Soo Ho, the CEO.

9
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.180
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.050
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.650
That's a nice shirt.

12
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.059
Let's go inside.

13
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.330
We wanted to see you because...

14
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.059
I heard about it.

15
00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.699
And I understood what you mean.

16
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.869
I completely agree with what you said.

17
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:11.170
I'll do as you want me to.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.800
Thank you.

19
00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.640
I didn't expect you to give me...

20
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.940
a positive answer right away.

21
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.140
Instead,

22
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.080
I have a condition.

23
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.879
Fire away.

24
00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.750
I'll tell you if you say you will do it.

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890
I'll have to hear it first.

26
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.330
It's nothing unreasonable.

27
00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.629
It has something to do with your business too.

28
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.629
Tell me.

29
00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.030
It's...

30
00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:47.569
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.840
I recently caught a cold.

32
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.780
Black herbal tea. You, citrus tea.

33
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.780
- Okay. - Black herbal tea.

34
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.080
Bring some heat packs.

35
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.119
(A Tour Around My Neighborhood)

36
00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.819
I'm going to Mr. Moon's office.

37
00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.390
Bye.

38
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.030
I feel much better.

39
00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.199
Thank you.

40
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.810
You can finish that and tell me when you're ready.

41
00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.379
Will you let me live in your guest house...

42
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.979
for a month?

43
00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.549
I live in a room in Sharon Tailor,

44
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.949
but we have to undergo some construction.

45
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.289
It's an old house, so there is a draft as well.

46
00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.090
It seems to be defective in many ways.

47
00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.370
That's an unexpected condition.

48
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.099
It suits the purpose of the guesthouse though.

49
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.669
I need to ask the other guests' opinions first.

50
00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.370
I already know there are...

51
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.079
a lot of rooms and bathrooms there.

52
00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.449
And it's your company guest house.

53
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.120
So you're the one who decides, aren't you?

54
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.690
Any other conditions?

55
00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.289
It was so cold,

56
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.520
so I couldn't think of anything else.

57
00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:19.259
Let me know after you talk to your guests.

58
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.160
I'll be waiting.

59
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.870
Okay.

60
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.669
I'd appreciate your prompt reply.

61
00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.340
I'm really cold right now.

62
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.410
How about I...

63
00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.310
book a suite in a premium hotel for a month?

64
00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.949
Only if you want it.

65
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.490
I don't.

66
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.990
I asked you because I liked your project.

67
00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.930
Forget it then.

68
00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.829
Old buildings are so inconvenient.

69
00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.870
It'd be better to demolish them...

70
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.470
and build a studio apartment.

71
00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.569
Let's say this talk never happened.

72
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.330
What brings you here?

73
00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:27.130
My travel agency is doing a collaborative project.

74
00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:29.070
With Mr. Moon's company?

75
00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.169
Yes.

76
00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.270
Why are you here?

77
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.140
I came here for business as well.

78
00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.470
What kind of project is it?

79
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.380
It's about connecting regenerative...

80
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.510
city with storytelling and tourism.

81
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.109
You're showing off.

82
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.809
What do you mean?

83
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.049
Good luck.

84
00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.150
By the way,

85
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.349
that wardrobe project fell through.

86
00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.619
So you can relax now.

87
00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.660
Good. It was an annoying project.

88
00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:00.859
This is the list of the owners.

89
00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:01.869
All right.

90
00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:03.099
They won't sign.

91
00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.700
They said they'd never sign.

92
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.770
We can't do anything about it.

93
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.070
Hello.

94
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.340
Hi.

95
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.470
I brought the tour package pamphlets,

96
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.640
and some books about neighborhoods in Seoul.

97
00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:18.150
Is there something going on?

98
00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:24.720
Hi, Mr. Moon.

99
00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.460
Ms. Jung. You're here.

100
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.489
It's good to see you at work.

101
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.200
Please sit down.

102
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.340
I just heard.

103
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.470
- Hear what? - About Sharon Tailor.

104
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.439
You need her help for your business.

105
00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.510
You have extra rooms. Tell her to move in.

106
00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:50.849
You and your aunt will be uncomfortable.

107
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.580
No, we won't.

108
00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:54.380
But I will be.

109
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.289
It's only for a month.

110
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.960
Our old neighborhood is at stake.

111
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.320
Letting her move in isn't a problem.

112
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.289
I'll clean the rooms after work.

113
00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.359
But I will choose her room myself.

114
00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:06.999
It'll be the farthest room from yours.

115
00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.999
And it'll be much smaller than mine.

116
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.169
You can give her the tiny, corner room.

117
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.609
Hae Ra, you don't have to do this.

118
00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:19.280
If you want something from someone,

119
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.710
you need to do something big for their sake.

120
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.010
You told me that.

121
00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.150
I was kidding about the corner room.

122
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.950
I'll pick a decent one for her.

123
00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:30.789
Didn't you agree with redeveloping the city?

124
00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:31.919
I did.

125
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.989
But now, I have the same opinion as you.

126
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.630
Since I was little...

127
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.729
Since you were little...

128
00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:45.799
you were always right.

129
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.939
I'll get going now.

130
00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:58.549
Don't worry. I took care of it.

131
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.419
It was nothing.

132
00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:02.989
Take care.

133
00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:04.289
Bye.

134
00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:07.890
Can you fix this?

135
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.539
What's going on?

136
00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.510
Let's work hard, Chan Ki.

137
00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:27.910
They made hearts...

138
00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.189
Why can she live there,

139
00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:43.390
but not me?

140
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.799
This blouse you made for Hae Ra a while ago...

141
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.070
She hasn't been here to pick it up.

142
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.679
It'd look gorgeous on her.

143
00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:45.390
Were you working outside?

144
00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:47.959
Gon.

145
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.169
Hey, why did you order so many?

146
00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:58.370
I thought maybe you didn't have time to eat lunch.

147
00:08:58.469 --> 00:09:00.939
You know, I never forget to take a lunch break.

148
00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:02.410
You don't know me so well.

149
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.839
Actually...

150
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.709
I came here because of this.

151
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.280
When Geumseong-dong is redeveloped,

152
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.549
and a new studio apartment is built,

153
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.520
my dad will give you a commercial unit.

154
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.360
Will he actually keep his promise?

155
00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:21.360
I signed it too.

156
00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:23.959
Your aunt also signed it already.

157
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.459
Did she?

158
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.130
When it's redeveloped,

159
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.630
you'll get a unit for sure.

160
00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:36.410
You just need to sign it and return it to me.

161
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.510
I'll think about it.

162
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.280
What's there to think about?

163
00:09:42.579 --> 00:09:44.309
I don't agree with the redevelopment.

164
00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.179
It's better to preserve the neighborhood.

165
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.150
Well...

166
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.559
It's nice to preserve the neighborhood, but...

167
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.990
you won't get a store.

168
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.299
Did your dad make you do this?

169
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.130
No.

170
00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:06.370
I came here because of you.

171
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.640
Why?

172
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.709
My family...

173
00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:13.209
owes you.

174
00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.780
When your dad passed away and it was all chaotic,

175
00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:20.150
my dad bought your family's land cheap.

176
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.660
It's probably because my mom needed money then.

177
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.660
Let's eat. I have to go back to work.

178
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.309
Even if you don't sign this,

179
00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:48.679
hold on to it.

180
00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:56.490
And tell me...

181
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.819
if you're uncomfortable staying at his house.

182
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.490
Don't worry. Just take care of Young Mi.

183
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.860
Don't be a fool, just because you're in love.

184
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.770
I don't like you living in his house.

185
00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.100
It's okay. You don't owe me anything.

186
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.370
You were my first love.

187
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.480
I know yours was Soo Ho.

188
00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:22.350
Don't get me wrong.

189
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.150
Young Mi and I are doing great together.

190
00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:26.819
Okay. Be good to her.

191
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:30.990
I will.

192
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.719
Bye.

193
00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:58.150
How dare you ask me to come here?

194
00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:01.350
You didn't have to, so why did you?

195
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.890
Are you mad at me for getting the bathhouse?

196
00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:05.620
You pretend...

197
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.360
to play by the rules,

198
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.929
but you actually play dirty like dogs.

199
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.799
Where did you bury Hae Ra's dad?

200
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.770
I know you arranged his burial.

201
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.410
I buried him in his family's grave site...

202
00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:23.510
in the mountains that's as small as my palm.

203
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.140
Who registered his death?

204
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.839
Hae Ra's mom did.

205
00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:29.709
How did he pass away?

206
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.480
Why are you asking me that?

207
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.949
You must know that better than I do.

208
00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:35.650
Me?

209
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.459
I'm not someone you can play with.

210
00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:41.730
The more you try to hold out,

211
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.059
you'll not only lose the bathhouse.

212
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.900
What more will you take away from me?

213
00:12:48.169 --> 00:12:50.370
My father, the bathhouse, and what else?

214
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.640
I didn't take him away from you.

215
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.339
It was an unfortunate accident.

216
00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:55.770
Maybe you're destined...

217
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.910
to lose all the people you love.

218
00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:05.219
Tell Hae Ra to be careful.

219
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.620
I won't stay still if you do any harm to her.

220
00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.339
That's cool of you.

221
00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:28.410
I'm done with my question. Thank you for coming.

222
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.049
Rude punk.

223
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:57.669
Maybe you're destined...

224
00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:00.799
to lose all the people you love.

225
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.419
I'd like to recommend...

226
00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:14.480
these two necklaces for a gift.

227
00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:17.020
It's our new product. What do you think?

228
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.020
I'll take this one.

229
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.929
I have an old silver ring.

230
00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:27.600
Can you melt it with gold and make couple rings?

231
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.030
That's possible. Bring it to us.

232
00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:39.110
She's weird,

233
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.039
so why does she own so many lands?

234
00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:44.079
I shouldn't clean it so hard.

235
00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:47.079
This should be enough.

236
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.020
Are you home, Hae Ra?

237
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.390
I'm here.

238
00:14:53.089 --> 00:14:55.289
- What are you doing? - I can let Sharon...

239
00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:56.860
use this room, right?

240
00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:58.900
You don't have to clean. Come out.

241
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.699
- Let's have dinner. - All right.

242
00:15:05.969 --> 00:15:08.309
We might be having dinner with two more people soon.

243
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.469
I haven't called her yet.

244
00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:12.780
I won't if you say no.

245
00:15:14.209 --> 00:15:16.480
Why would I say no? It's only for a month.

246
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.610
Let her in.

247
00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.219
I've lived like weeds until now.

248
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.589
I'm good at adapting and flattering.

249
00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:28.959
She's weird,

250
00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:30.459
but I'll be good to her.

251
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.230
I have to keep my private and public life separate.

252
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.699
You've grown well.

253
00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:38.000
You too.

254
00:15:43.469 --> 00:15:44.679
It might burn.

255
00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:46.880
It looks good.

256
00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:49.079
- Did you sprinkle salt? - Yes.

257
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:59.919
Hae Ra didn't sign?

258
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.260
She's against the redevelopment.

259
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.059
I'll try to persuade her.

260
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.459
Gosh, she must be crazy.

261
00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:07.799
She refused money?

262
00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:09.730
I can't understand.

263
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.240
Once she gets married with Soo Ho,

264
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.839
she'll have his fortunes.

265
00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.539
She isn't that calculating.

266
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.679
How do you know what's in people's minds?

267
00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:21.309
It could be included in her love.

268
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.480
Is Hae Ra aware?

269
00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:28.490
I'm worried she might be doing this out of guilt.

270
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:32.490
What do you mean?

271
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.959
Hae Ra's father took Soo Ho in his house...

272
00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:37.900
and let him stay with his teenage daughter...

273
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.860
for a reason.

274
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.500
Why was that?

275
00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:46.299
He needed something.

276
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.209
Doctor Moon's secret documents.

277
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.780
Let's see.

278
00:16:59.549 --> 00:17:01.120
It's delicious.

279
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.689
It's nicely seasoned too.

280
00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:05.360
Because Soo Ho is always right.

281
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.860
I shouldn't have said it. You say it habitually now.

282
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.630
Eat some more rice because I'm always right.

283
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.469
I might gain weight.

284
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:17.100
Doctor Moon...

285
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.239
died because of Hae Ra's father.

286
00:17:28.509 --> 00:17:29.610
You don't have any fat in your body.

287
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.550
It's all hidden somewhere in my body.

288
00:17:32.749 --> 00:17:34.050
Really? Let me see.

289
00:17:36.219 --> 00:17:37.219
Stop your move.

290
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.600
He discovered a natural preservative element...

291
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.729
that could replace chemical elements.

292
00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:48.400
He discovered it from the peony root extract.

293
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.140
It was research data that could be successful...

294
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.699
in the cosmetics and food processing fields.

295
00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:55.840
Hae Ra's father ran a cosmetics...

296
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.570
materials company.

297
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.310
It supplied materials to a famous cosmetics company.

298
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.979
Hae Ra's father asked him for help...

299
00:18:02.979 --> 00:18:05.679
to open a new business, but he refused to help.

300
00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:10.090
He used it without permission.

301
00:18:11.989 --> 00:18:13.620
Your aunt seems to be busy.

302
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.330
She's sleeping out today.

303
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.759
She has a card battle at a sauna or something.

304
00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:24.169
Then...

305
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.400
is it just the two of us in the house today?

306
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:27.870
Yes.

307
00:18:29.469 --> 00:18:31.179
What? Are you scared?

308
00:18:32.209 --> 00:18:33.209
Yes.

309
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.779
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

310
00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:39.749
You don't have to.

311
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.050
What?

312
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.759
Doctor Moon became a betrayer...

313
00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:52.330
to an organization that invested on him.

314
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.130
He suffered so much.

315
00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:57.900
It's different from my memory.

316
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.840
What do you know? You were only a child then.

317
00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:03.640
I remember something vaguely too.

318
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.040
I visited Hae Ra's house...

319
00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:09.709
on her birthday when I was young.

320
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.650
I went to the second floor...

321
00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:20.519
to hide a gift for our treasure hunt game.

322
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.630
Why would you search through my study room?

323
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.100
What are you suspecting?

324
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.300
He gave me this so that I could go over and check...

325
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.800
if it could be commercialized or not.

326
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.830
Don't you remember?

327
00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:33.300
Hae Ra's father was scolding someone...

328
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.439
for searching through his study room.

329
00:19:41.009 --> 00:19:42.009
But...

330
00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:44.820
I can't clearly remember...

331
00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.620
whom he was scolding.

332
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.560
So you remember.

333
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.529
Doctor Moon suspected Hae Ra's father...

334
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:56.060
and went through his study room.

335
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:57.529
Well...

336
00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.360
I think so.

337
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.900
He took Soo Ho in...

338
00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:03.199
out of guilt and to take away...

339
00:20:03.199 --> 00:20:07.300
the original copy of the document from him.

340
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.939
You have no way to prove that.

341
00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:11.679
I'm the witness.

342
00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:16.610
I should ask Hae Ra myself...

343
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.519
if she rejected money and is siding Moon Soo Ho...

344
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.489
because she is feeling guilty.

345
00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:25.259
Doctor Moon died of fire.

346
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.360
Hae Ra's father didn't set the fire.

347
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.390
He was in pain,

348
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.400
had a drink, and fell asleep.

349
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.300
A short circuit caused the fire.

350
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.360
Father.

351
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.040
Don't make up lies.

352
00:20:38.469 --> 00:20:40.699
Don't mix business with your personal feelings.

353
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.870
What do you mean?

354
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.540
You were least successful among the three.

355
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.979
You felt ignored because of your inferior complex.

356
00:20:48.709 --> 00:20:50.979
- It's unreasonable. - Why you little...

357
00:20:55.719 --> 00:20:57.719
Gosh, Father.

358
00:20:57.719 --> 00:20:59.090
Why did you have to do this?

359
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.989
Among us three,

360
00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:03.989
I'm the only one alive.

361
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.300
And I'm the richest.

362
00:21:06.729 --> 00:21:09.800
And I'm going to be richer and richer.

363
00:21:24.479 --> 00:21:25.479
Gon.

364
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.060
I'm not lying.

365
00:21:34.729 --> 00:21:35.759
They got punished...

366
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.729
for ignoring me.

367
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.370
They got punished for ignoring me!

368
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.300
I wonder what Chul Min is doing.

369
00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:53.310
Do you remember the newspaper delivery boy?

370
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.880
The cute boy with big eyes.

371
00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:57.610
Why do you ask that all of a sudden?

372
00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:00.419
I was so lonely and depressed today.

373
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.249
I was reminded of Chul Min who liked me.

374
00:22:11.499 --> 00:22:12.999
You need to eat taffy...

375
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.070
when you're lonely and in pain.

376
00:22:15.729 --> 00:22:17.529
Don't you remember...

377
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.769
that masters had a bit of taffy...

378
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.140
before taking the state examination?

379
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.410
Once you eat something sweet,

380
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.110
your brain comes to its senses.

381
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.850
It's too hard for me...

382
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.979
to be lonely for 200 years.

383
00:22:34.449 --> 00:22:36.820
This should fade away before summer.

384
00:22:38.189 --> 00:22:41.360
I only had two men in my long life.

385
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.529
My dear husband.

386
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.800
Lee Myung So.

387
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.830
Currently known as Moon Soo Ho.

388
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:49.830
This doesn't work either.

389
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.400
And Chul Min, who liked me.

390
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.499
I can't get this off.

391
00:22:55.769 --> 00:22:57.469
Make me that perfume for me.

392
00:22:58.439 --> 00:23:00.179
The perfume that can bewitch someone's heart.

393
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.610
There's no such thing.

394
00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:06.850
My customer will be here soon.

395
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.249
Go.

396
00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.989
I'm sure Chul Min still loves me.

397
00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:15.130
He probably will do anything that I want.

398
00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:17.729
What do you want?

399
00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:20.499
Send Jung Hae Ra far away from Moon Soo Ho.

400
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:24.999
Go home and have some taffy.

401
00:23:28.969 --> 00:23:31.140
You don't even have a man that you long for.

402
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.439
You're more pathetic.

403
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.800
I'll call you back in a little bit.

404
00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:57.769
Something might pop out from the side.

405
00:23:58.499 --> 00:23:59.570
Are you scared?

406
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.610
No.

407
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.040
I remember how you hated watching a scary movie.

408
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.279
I was the only one who watched it to...

409
00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:11.479
My gosh, that was shocking.

410
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.919
What was that? Is it gone?

411
00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:17.749
I thought you were going to protect me.

412
00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:20.590
Why did you want to watch that movie?

413
00:24:25.729 --> 00:24:27.160
- Hae Ra. - Yes?

414
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.370
What's that?

415
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:30.100
What?

416
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.580
Stay still.

417
00:25:01.969 --> 00:25:03.429
This is harder than I thought.

418
00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:06.600
Is this your first time doing it?

419
00:25:11.439 --> 00:25:12.610
Yes, it's my first time.

420
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.679
It's my first time getting one too.

421
00:25:20.419 --> 00:25:21.749
Why did you get me this?

422
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.790
Just because. I wanted to give you one.

423
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.890
I'm going to do...

424
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.560
everything I wanted to do that I couldn't.

425
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.300
I don't have anything I can give you.

426
00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:40.800
You staying here with me is a present to me.

427
00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.620
I'll do the dishes.

428
00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.290
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

429
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.060
Rock-paper-scissors.

430
00:26:02.229 --> 00:26:03.229
Rock-paper-scissors.

431
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.029
Rock-paper-scissors.

432
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:14.199
You must be really lucky.

433
00:26:15.209 --> 00:26:16.969
The winner will do the dishes.

434
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.239
I'll go with you.

435
00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:28.489
(Let's make this happen, Ms. Choi.)

436
00:26:29.219 --> 00:26:30.249
What is this?

437
00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:32.219
I'm here to give you a message from Mr. Moon.

438
00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:34.529
You can move into his guest house.

439
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.999
He declined before.

440
00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:39.860
He didn't exactly decline it.

441
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.600
You can let me know when you'd like to move in.

442
00:26:42.729 --> 00:26:44.640
Tell him to come and tell me himself.

443
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.840
He will.

444
00:26:46.499 --> 00:26:49.009
I was only here to give you the flowers.

445
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.959
I'll have to make cute pajamas.

446
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:14.029
I'm very timid, so I don't usually cause any trouble,

447
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:17.130
so it was really weird back then.

448
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.540
I even took out a loan to buy that old house.

449
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.140
It was as if I was possessed.

450
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.439
It's very uncanny.

451
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.380
Soo Ho's company ended up buying that house,

452
00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:28.209
then you all started living together.

453
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.820
Soo Ho and Hae Ra's family must be acquainted too.

454
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.919
You're right.

455
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.350
That's the thing about fate.

456
00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:41.189
Do you still make...

457
00:27:41.929 --> 00:27:44.229
the best dried pollack soup?

458
00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:46.660
I'm amazing at it.

459
00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.729
I'm better now than when I was an assistant cook.

460
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.840
I'll go over to have some.

461
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.939
Okay.

462
00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:57.509
You were the most beautiful customer...

463
00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:00.610
that our soup place ever had.

464
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.519
I need to pay you back for that compliment.

465
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.050
I'll make you a bottle of perfume.

466
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.390
This is...

467
00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:20.029
something you can wear every day.

468
00:28:20.259 --> 00:28:23.300
I'll add a drop of herb extract.

469
00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:31.810
That smells so good.

470
00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:35.449
It feels like I became an elegant countess.

471
00:28:36.449 --> 00:28:38.019
It's said that ancient Egyptians...

472
00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:40.719
controlled people with scents.

473
00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.350
Really?

474
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.449
If not, forget it.

475
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.590
You have a rather big mouth, don't you?

476
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.759
What are you saying?

477
00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:54.300
I've been keeping this secret until now.

478
00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:56.469
But...

479
00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.999
when I lie, it shows on my face.

480
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.469
Don't you feel like you're lying on a warm field?

481
00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:31.699
When you smell this,

482
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.070
you will fall asleep in peace.

483
00:29:36.939 --> 00:29:37.979
And...

484
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.840
you will trust whatever I say.

485
00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.550
This effect is stronger on a night...

486
00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:49.620
with a full moon.

487
00:29:56.189 --> 00:29:57.489
Forget the fact...

488
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.459
that I sent you to be with Hae Ra.

489
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.529
I wanted to show up on their wedding day,

490
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.669
but it happened a bit sooner.

491
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.540
Okay.

492
00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:12.509
Forget it.

493
00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:17.350
Is that the only thing I have to forget?

494
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.790
I don't have to forget anything else, right?

495
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.390
Like what?

496
00:30:29.414 --> 00:30:34.414
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E11 Black Knight "That's My Husband"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

497
00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.340
I don't know everything either.

498
00:30:43.439 --> 00:30:45.410
I don't know why Soo Ho ended up...

499
00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.979
living with Hae Ra's family as an orphan.

500
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.279
I just know that...

501
00:30:55.719 --> 00:30:58.419
they were destined to meet again.

502
00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:11.600
Oh, gosh. My goodness.

503
00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:15.269
Did you want to peek while I got changed?

504
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.840
No, I saw the dryer in here,

505
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.009
so I came to drop this off.

506
00:31:19.439 --> 00:31:21.080
I thought you were going to protect me.

507
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.580
Why?

508
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.650
It must be broken. I can't open it.

509
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.419
Really?

510
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.060
I think it'll open when we kiss.

511
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.600
We can't do that, Soo Ho.

512
00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.269
I have to protect you.

513
00:31:44.429 --> 00:31:45.469
Right.

514
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:48.439
We'll have to spend the night in here.

515
00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:50.239
I have to go out early in the morning.

516
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.310
Go to sleep, then.

517
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.080
I'll stand here and sleep.

518
00:31:56.449 --> 00:31:57.880
- Goodness. - What are you doing?

519
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.719
What? I didn't turn it off on purpose.

520
00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.290
Where's the switch?

521
00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:10.090
We'll have a guest here for a month,

522
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.560
so let me kiss you just 30 times.

523
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.519
Goodnight.

524
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.959
Goodnight.

525
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.650
Why didn't you wake me up?

526
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.320
I dozed off.

527
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.120
I'm going home now.

528
00:33:13.219 --> 00:33:14.360
What do you think about this pajamas?

529
00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:16.959
Pajamas?

530
00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:22.600
You can wear that to an award ceremony.

531
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.499
It's really pretty.

532
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:26.340
Success.

533
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.070
Why did you make this?

534
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.679
To seduce him.

535
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.979
Seduce who?

536
00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:39.850
Good.

537
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.689
It's a Year of the Dog.

538
00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:43.850
We need to work out like dogs.

539
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:44.860
Let's go.

540
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.219
You can do it.

541
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.060
Where's Mr. Han?

542
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.660
Is he at a meeting with Mr. Moon?

543
00:33:55.699 --> 00:33:58.669
Mr. Moon went to a city breakfast meeting,

544
00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:00.300
- and Mr. Han... - I see.

545
00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:02.870
And Mr. Han?

546
00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:08.080
He is...

547
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.649
very busy running around.

548
00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.520
So it's because of the old man who betrayed you guys.

549
00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.790
Choi Seo Rin?

550
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:22.460
I didn't want them to be suspicious,

551
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.060
so I couldn't ask anymore.

552
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:27.629
Here.

553
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.940
I wrote down everything I heard.

554
00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.839
She owns this much land.

555
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.509
She's very rich.

556
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.609
They're trying to her him over, right?

557
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:42.179
With this much land,

558
00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.649
wouldn't her property go up in price...

559
00:34:44.009 --> 00:34:45.520
with redevelopment?

560
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.520
Of course.

561
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.489
It'll be hard for Soo Ho to persuade him.

562
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.420
Thanks for your work.

563
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.259
It was nothing.

564
00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:55.790
Is there anything you need?

565
00:34:57.029 --> 00:34:58.399
Could you...

566
00:34:58.799 --> 00:35:00.699
drop me off at Haneul Hospital?

567
00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:01.799
It's close by.

568
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.770
Are you sick?

569
00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:09.509
Hey.

570
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.580
The client's name is Yoon Dal Hong, right?

571
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.879
He's the father,

572
00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:16.149
and the son is Yoon Sang Jin.

573
00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:18.649
Yoon Sang Jin is in the hospital, right?

574
00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:20.649
Okay.

575
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.489
What's going on?

576
00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.759
(Yoon Sang Jin)

577
00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:30.359
I'm very sorry about what happened.

578
00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:31.759
I'd love to...

579
00:35:31.759 --> 00:35:34.429
put a hold on his membership.

580
00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:36.830
But it's the gym's policy.

581
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.540
Look, young man.

582
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.239
Think about it.

583
00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:43.410
He had a car accident, and he's unconscious in bed.

584
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.140
Of course you should refund the fee...

585
00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.080
or put a hold on his membership.

586
00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:49.149
Well, sir...

587
00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.350
Here you go.

588
00:35:56.949 --> 00:35:58.589
Rich people are something.

589
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:59.890
Even when his son is sick in bed,

590
00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.390
he's thinking about the membership.

591
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.460
He keeps asking...

592
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.129
to put a hold on his son's gym membership.

593
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.469
He even asked for discount.

594
00:36:09.899 --> 00:36:11.000
It's shocking.

595
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.370
Isn't it?

596
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.609
Rich people are worse.

597
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.980
Yoon Dal Hong is the one who betrayed...

598
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.779
Soo Ho and cancelled the contract.

599
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.279
His son got hurt.

600
00:36:30.049 --> 00:36:31.259
It must've been a coincidence, right?

601
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.830
Since the accident was caused by speeding.

602
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.100
Of course. It must've been a coincidence.

603
00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:51.879
I'm sorry I'm late.

604
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:54.710
It's okay.

605
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.779
Your employees told me stories.

606
00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:57.949
They were fun.

607
00:36:58.379 --> 00:36:59.649
You must be really busy.

608
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.819
There are a lot of appointments today.

609
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.359
Well...

610
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.420
The two story house...

611
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:09.359
in Geumseong 2-dong,

612
00:37:09.929 --> 00:37:12.500
and the old building with stationery store...

613
00:37:12.799 --> 00:37:14.060
are also mine.

614
00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:16.100
I own the land as well.

615
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.199
You have property in Geumseong 2-dong too?

616
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.410
Property and time are...

617
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.540
all I have.

618
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.179
I also support...

619
00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:30.810
neighborhood revival project.

620
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.420
Thank you.

621
00:37:34.149 --> 00:37:35.190
Anyway,

622
00:37:36.549 --> 00:37:39.120
Park Chul Min won't be an easy opponent.

623
00:37:39.759 --> 00:37:42.560
How are you going to deal with Chairman Park?

624
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:48.330
There was a construction company...

625
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.730
that wanted the land...

626
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.640
my dad's lab was built on.

627
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.540
Chairman Park received money...

628
00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:55.770
from the company and set the lab on fire.

629
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.839
I saw him leaving the lab in a hurry.

630
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.310
Your dad could've sold the building...

631
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.620
and moved the lab.

632
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.250
The lab was a historical building.

633
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.649
A lot of people opposed of it being demolished.

634
00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:12.259
They even wrote petitions.

635
00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:16.790
Chairman Park caused a short circuit...

636
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.699
on purpose, and the lab full of chemical exploded.

637
00:38:20.929 --> 00:38:23.500
He must've known there was someone in there.

638
00:38:26.969 --> 00:38:28.810
You lost your dad,

639
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.009
and your mom collapsed from shock.

640
00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.609
So I lived with Hae Ra's family.

641
00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:48.359
Are you cold?

642
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.560
No.

643
00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:53.399
Someone just came to mind.

644
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:58.870
Someone who planted greed in young Chul Min's mind.

645
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:02.170
The one who told him to become rich...

646
00:39:02.609 --> 00:39:04.239
by any means.

647
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.410
Is it someone you know?

648
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.149
Anyway, I'm...

649
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.620
on your side.

650
00:39:32.299 --> 00:39:34.069
That's peculiar.

651
00:39:43.779 --> 00:39:46.219
I told Chul Min to become rich by any means.

652
00:39:48.149 --> 00:39:50.290
- Because you pitied him? - Yes, and...

653
00:39:50.649 --> 00:39:51.719
you never know,

654
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.790
I might need his help later.

655
00:39:55.089 --> 00:39:56.690
Because he'll never forget me.

656
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:03.899
You used his innocent heart,

657
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.969
and turned Chul Min into a monster.

658
00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:09.239
Become a rich man, Chul Min,

659
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.710
by any means.

660
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.980
Dad!

661
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.210
Chul Min wanted to prove it to you,

662
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.219
so he sold his conscience.

663
00:40:21.449 --> 00:40:22.520
And because of that...

664
00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.890
Soo Ho and Hae Ra met.

665
00:40:35.029 --> 00:40:36.629
The monster you created...

666
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.500
brought them together.

667
00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.489
Why isn't he here yet?

668
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:04.730
Hello.

669
00:41:10.299 --> 00:41:11.399
Hello.

670
00:41:12.299 --> 00:41:14.140
It's strange seeing you in the afternoon.

671
00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:16.770
I'd like to order a suit.

672
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.509
I'm busy today.

673
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.080
Couldn't you just take my measurements?

674
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.779
Making clothes starts with taking measurements.

675
00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:26.620
Why don't we just have some coffee today?

676
00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:30.420
Seung Goo. Please bring us coffee.

677
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.560
Is...

678
00:41:32.359 --> 00:41:34.089
your name Choi Seo Rin?

679
00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.199
I guess you saw that.

680
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.040
I don't like my real name.

681
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.739
Just call me Sharon.

682
00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:52.509
Whose gown is that?

683
00:41:56.279 --> 00:41:57.279
It's pretty.

684
00:41:58.049 --> 00:41:59.120
It's mine.

685
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.750
Would you like to try it on?

686
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.049
It's okay.

687
00:42:04.219 --> 00:42:06.259
You don't look like a bad guy.

688
00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.529
I'll make you a suit.

689
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.460
I want to help Hae Ra.

690
00:42:14.129 --> 00:42:15.629
I work with people who want to...

691
00:42:15.629 --> 00:42:17.399
redevelop Geumseong-dong.

692
00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:20.969
My dad promised to give a shop for Hae Ra...

693
00:42:21.469 --> 00:42:22.609
if a shopping mall...

694
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:23.839
and studio apartments are built.

695
00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:27.179
- Why? - We owe Hae Ra.

696
00:42:27.949 --> 00:42:29.179
That's interesting.

697
00:42:29.649 --> 00:42:31.920
Mr. Moon's business has to fail,

698
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.589
so Hae Ra could have a fortune.

699
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.250
When the neighborhood is redeveloped,

700
00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:38.460
it'll be good for you too.

701
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.120
Does Mr. Moon know about...

702
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.460
the shop promised to Hae Ra?

703
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.460
I don't think so.

704
00:42:45.799 --> 00:42:48.629
Hae Ra is against the redevelopment too.

705
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.370
I decided to help Mr. Moon.

706
00:42:54.969 --> 00:42:56.710
I hope you change your decision.

707
00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.710
Come to take measurements two days later.

708
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.850
As the big franchise opened,

709
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.250
3 bakeries closed down, and there's only 1 left.

710
00:43:10.449 --> 00:43:11.960
We need to protect this place.

711
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.960
We're brainstorming on how to protect it.

712
00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:17.730
Is the travel agency presentation tomorrow?

713
00:43:17.859 --> 00:43:18.859
That's right.

714
00:43:18.859 --> 00:43:22.069
We don't have to prepare for the presentation data.

715
00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:24.230
Sir.

716
00:43:24.399 --> 00:43:26.000
Oh, Mr. Han and Chan Ki should join me...

717
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.410
for the Seoul New Deal meeting.

718
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.710
Sir.

719
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.140
What?

720
00:43:33.379 --> 00:43:34.609
It's time to go.

721
00:43:43.319 --> 00:43:44.390
What's this?

722
00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.660
It's past 6pm.

723
00:43:46.859 --> 00:43:48.560
Gosh, it's freezing.

724
00:43:49.029 --> 00:43:51.429
Why do you keep leaving the tailoring room open?

725
00:43:51.759 --> 00:43:53.160
You turned off the heater too.

726
00:43:53.299 --> 00:43:54.330
Leave it.

727
00:43:54.899 --> 00:43:56.029
I need to keep this place cold.

728
00:43:56.029 --> 00:43:58.600
Deduct heating bills from my salary.

729
00:43:58.839 --> 00:44:00.000
I'm turning it on.

730
00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:01.239
Don't.

731
00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.170
Are you Elsa of "Frozen" or something?

732
00:44:04.469 --> 00:44:05.739
I'm going home.

733
00:44:05.879 --> 00:44:08.179
You aren't going anywhere until you end your work.

734
00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:10.379
Okay, bye

735
00:44:10.379 --> 00:44:11.520
Gosh, it's cold.

736
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.089
Let it go

737
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.629
It's cold.

738
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.699
Hello.

739
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.440
How have you been?

740
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.509
Hello.

741
00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.779
It's a token of our gratitude.

742
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.210
I received the flower basket as well.

743
00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.819
The more flowers, the better it is.

744
00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:47.449
It's really cold in here.

745
00:44:47.449 --> 00:44:48.520
When I came last time...

746
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.089
Did you think I lied?

747
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.390
Thank you for your decision once again.

748
00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.589
Thank you for letting me stay in your house.

749
00:44:58.859 --> 00:45:00.799
When will you move in?

750
00:45:01.299 --> 00:45:02.429
Today.

751
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.270
I want to go right away. It's freezing here.

752
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:09.069
You're off from work, right?

753
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:11.339
Let's go together. Give me a ride.

754
00:45:11.339 --> 00:45:13.440
Oh, I have work left to do.

755
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.649
He'll give you a ride.

756
00:45:14.649 --> 00:45:16.009
Oh, sir.

757
00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:19.049
I'll take care of that matter.

758
00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:20.480
You can go home.

759
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.020
Let's go.

760
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.160
Okay.

761
00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.670
Hae Ra, are you home?

762
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080
Yes.

763
00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:47.810
You're home early.

764
00:46:04.029 --> 00:46:05.529
Where's my room?

765
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.730
It was decided suddenly,

766
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.239
so I couldn't tell you beforehand.

767
00:46:13.399 --> 00:46:14.739
Come this way.

768
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.379
- Goodness. - Gosh.

769
00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.980
That's Mr. Moon's room.

770
00:46:25.049 --> 00:46:26.250
Come this way.

771
00:46:27.819 --> 00:46:28.949
It hurts.

772
00:46:44.899 --> 00:46:46.299
I didn't know you were coming today,

773
00:46:46.299 --> 00:46:48.210
so I did nothing yet except for cleaning.

774
00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:50.210
It's okay.

775
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.410
I should be thankful for letting me stay.

776
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:58.549
I'm sorry. Wait a minute here.

777
00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.219
Use the restroom right next to this room.

778
00:47:05.219 --> 00:47:07.489
A shower booth and bathtub are in there.

779
00:47:08.489 --> 00:47:09.960
Give me a cup of water.

780
00:47:15.469 --> 00:47:16.569
I'm thirsty.

781
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.140
I'll tell you where the kitchen is.

782
00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.270
Follow me.

783
00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.770
She says things like it's her house.

784
00:47:28.649 --> 00:47:30.250
We have meals here.

785
00:47:32.719 --> 00:47:33.879
Well...

786
00:47:34.279 --> 00:47:36.420
There's a toaster over there.

787
00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.920
And there's an espresso machine too.

788
00:47:39.989 --> 00:47:41.690
What time do you usually have breakfast?

789
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.600
This isn't a hotel,

790
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.460
so it's not set particularly.

791
00:47:46.929 --> 00:47:48.830
Sometimes, we go to work without having breakfast.

792
00:47:48.929 --> 00:47:50.299
You two are busy,

793
00:47:50.299 --> 00:47:51.870
so maybe I should make breakfast for you.

794
00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.699
My aunt often makes breakfast for us.

795
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:56.069
Where's she?

796
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:58.210
She's a sauna lover,

797
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.210
so she might be back before midnight.

798
00:48:01.009 --> 00:48:02.049
Please come here.

799
00:48:14.629 --> 00:48:16.790
Stay like this only for today.

800
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:18.529
I'll get what you need tomorrow.

801
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.100
Thank you.

802
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.230
You made a bed for me too.

803
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:23.899
Goodnight.

804
00:48:25.899 --> 00:48:26.940
Let's go.

805
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:31.980
Call me when you need something.

806
00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.580
My room is right next to yours.

807
00:48:35.509 --> 00:48:36.649
Goodnight.

808
00:49:09.149 --> 00:49:10.549
I'm sorry for not telling you beforehand.

809
00:49:10.779 --> 00:49:11.949
She wanted to move in right away?

810
00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.179
Yes, it was flustering.

811
00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:16.390
That place really was cold.

812
00:49:17.219 --> 00:49:18.859
It wasn't that cold before.

813
00:49:18.859 --> 00:49:20.420
Maybe the heater broke.

814
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.029
It must be uncomfortable for you. I'm sorry.

815
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.299
Don't be.

816
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.399
I'll try my best to flatter her...

817
00:49:28.399 --> 00:49:30.699
so that she stays on our side until the end.

818
00:49:31.399 --> 00:49:33.199
You don't have to. It's my job.

819
00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:34.569
You don't have to flatter her.

820
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.810
Because I like you.

821
00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:47.020
What's wrong?

822
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.089
My heart just skipped a beat. I need to calm down.

823
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:54.060
Hae Ra, how do I use this?

824
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.660
Just a second.

825
00:50:07.199 --> 00:50:08.569
What are you doing?

826
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:49.009
You're still awake.

827
00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.440
Yes.

828
00:51:52.679 --> 00:51:54.879
I thought you were here for some more tea.

829
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:56.910
It's all right.

830
00:51:57.009 --> 00:51:58.080
Liar.

831
00:52:03.089 --> 00:52:04.560
Sleep early...

832
00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:07.060
or you might harm your health.

833
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.730
Isn't it uncomfortable in your room?

834
00:52:11.129 --> 00:52:12.299
It's okay.

835
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.429
I'm staying here only for a month.

836
00:52:16.529 --> 00:52:17.600
Goodnight.

837
00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.140
Have a sweet dream.

838
00:52:42.089 --> 00:52:43.790
My gosh, who are you?

839
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:45.299
Good morning, Aunt Sook Hee.

840
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.060
When did you get home?

841
00:52:47.259 --> 00:52:49.199
That's my question to you.

842
00:52:50.899 --> 00:52:52.170
Good morning, Mr. Moon.

843
00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.750
Goodness, are we having a feast?

844
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:03.250
Did you sleep well, Hae Ra?

845
00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:05.920
Have a seat.

846
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.520
There's nothing else I could do, so...

847
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.649
What's with her?

848
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.160
Did we have any seasoned vegetables?

849
00:53:12.219 --> 00:53:13.719
I brought some when I came over.

850
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.730
Come on, sit around.

851
00:53:16.929 --> 00:53:18.629
I have a breakfast meeting.

852
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:20.560
Goodbye, Ms. Lee.

853
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:21.770
Hae Ra, I'll call you later.

854
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:29.370
She'll be staying here for a month.

855
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.480
She's going to help Mr. Moon's business too.

856
00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.739
Then are we going to...

857
00:53:32.739 --> 00:53:34.810
eat like this for a month?

858
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:39.219
Goodness, you are going to burn that kimchi pancake.

859
00:53:41.989 --> 00:53:44.020
My goodness, did you burn yourself?

860
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.989
Gosh, this hurts.

861
00:53:47.989 --> 00:53:49.629
I'll find some medicine and put it on you.

862
00:53:49.629 --> 00:53:51.759
I'm fine. It's not that bad.

863
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.399
Your tattoo is unique.

864
00:53:56.629 --> 00:53:58.799
"A ghost of the nether world"?

865
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.810
Who is? Is she a ghost of the nether world?

866
00:54:06.339 --> 00:54:08.750
It was popular among tattoo shops in Hongdae.

867
00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.449
Don't you know?

868
00:54:11.379 --> 00:54:12.819
It's very bold. I like it.

869
00:54:13.879 --> 00:54:15.219
Thank you for breakfast.

870
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:17.920
Thank you for the food.

871
00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:23.529
It's a feast.

872
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.500
Hello. Good morning.

873
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.029
Good morning.

874
00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:33.040
(Lucky Letter)

875
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:35.940
What is this?

876
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:38.710
- Ju Hee. - Yes?

877
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.339
Did you get a lucky letter too?

878
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:41.609
No.

879
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:43.250
Did you get a lucky letter?

880
00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.049
A lucky letter?

881
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.219
Even young kids send those through a text nowadays.

882
00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.259
No one sends a handwritten letter anymore.

883
00:54:51.259 --> 00:54:52.259
Hae Ra.

884
00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.259
I didn't send that to you.

885
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:02.870
Moon Soo Ho is a dangerous man.

886
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:04.129
Be careful.

887
00:55:04.129 --> 00:55:05.399
To be continued.

888
00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:07.069
From Ji Hoon.

889
00:55:10.739 --> 00:55:12.109
He's insane.

890
00:55:30.529 --> 00:55:32.560
Goodness. I'll have something simple.

891
00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:33.960
I had too much breakfast.

892
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.069
I'm not too hungry.

893
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.899
Is she going to do that every day?

894
00:55:36.899 --> 00:55:38.199
That's too much.

895
00:55:39.799 --> 00:55:41.239
She's important for your business.

896
00:55:41.239 --> 00:55:43.040
Don't be so cold.

897
00:55:43.469 --> 00:55:45.109
She must've been embarrassed today.

898
00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:46.640
I did have an appointment today.

899
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.080
I didn't avoid her on purpose.

900
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.980
Come home tonight and have dinner with us.

901
00:55:51.149 --> 00:55:52.149
She's pretty peculiar,

902
00:55:52.149 --> 00:55:54.020
so she might end up changing her mind.

903
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.350
It's just for a month,

904
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:58.120
so let's do our best to be nice to her, okay?

905
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.129
Hae Ra, you sound like an adult.

906
00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.660
Call me Ms. Jung, then.

907
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:09.670
Ms. Jung.

908
00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:10.799
What?

909
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.239
Will you marry me?

910
00:56:19.879 --> 00:56:21.210
I love you, Ms. Jung.

911
00:56:41.299 --> 00:56:42.330
Come here.

912
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:45.600
Are you okay?

913
00:56:46.839 --> 00:56:48.670
You must be surprised.

914
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:16.100
What are you up to?

915
00:57:17.129 --> 00:57:19.739
Goodness, are you ironing Mr. Moon's shirt?

916
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.239
It's this thing because of my work.

917
00:57:24.739 --> 00:57:26.980
I can't stand any wrinkled clothes.

918
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:29.410
Aren't you going to work?

919
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:30.509
I'm the owner and the CEO.

920
00:57:30.509 --> 00:57:31.549
That's up to me.

921
00:57:33.379 --> 00:57:34.379
Aunt Sook Hee.

922
00:57:34.989 --> 00:57:36.790
I'm not your aunt.

923
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.560
Do you want me to make you an outfit?

924
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.089
Why do you...

925
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.160
suddenly want to do that?

926
00:57:50.299 --> 00:57:52.100
What does Mr. Moon like to eat?

927
00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:55.069
He's not that picky. He eats everything.

928
00:57:55.969 --> 00:57:57.509
Where do his parents live?

929
00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:00.779
I heard they passed away when he was young.

930
00:58:01.879 --> 00:58:02.949
Oh, no.

931
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:04.920
What happened?

932
00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:09.219
His dad was a famous chemist,

933
00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:11.219
and there was a fire at his research lab.

934
00:58:11.219 --> 00:58:13.719
And his mom passed away because of the shock.

935
00:58:14.219 --> 00:58:15.830
That's why Hae Ra's dad...

936
00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:18.029
became a guardian for him.

937
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:20.500
I remember reading that on a newspaper.

938
00:58:21.699 --> 00:58:23.969
Wasn't the lab old enough to be a cultural asset?

939
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:26.299
I don't know about that.

940
00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:28.009
I heard they built...

941
00:58:28.009 --> 00:58:30.069
apartments on the site of that lab.

942
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:32.540
That's the one. I know that building.

943
00:58:33.279 --> 00:58:35.810
It was a school dorm in the late Joseon period.

944
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:39.580
You say it like you've seen it with your eyes.

945
00:58:40.679 --> 00:58:41.819
He met Hae Ra...

946
00:58:41.819 --> 00:58:43.589
after he became unfortunate.

947
00:58:45.819 --> 00:58:48.190
I feel bad for him. He was so young.

948
00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:51.259
That means he was happy with his parents...

949
00:58:51.799 --> 00:58:53.759
before he met Hae Ra.

950
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.839
I'll help him go back to that time.

951
00:58:58.469 --> 00:58:59.699
How so?

952
00:59:00.469 --> 00:59:01.739
I'm done measuring you.

953
00:59:01.739 --> 00:59:03.040
- What? - I'm going out.

954
00:59:03.469 --> 00:59:06.279
What are you going to make me?

955
00:59:06.279 --> 00:59:08.750
I need a coat.

956
00:59:09.049 --> 00:59:10.109
A coat!

957
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.509
Ms. Choi left that there.

I once dreamt of becoming a scientist too.
