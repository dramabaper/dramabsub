00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:08.590
(Episode 38)

2
00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.370
What are you doing? Let me go,

3
00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.300
Won't you take me seriously?

4
00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.310
Where are you going? I'm not done yet,

5
00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:26.610
Do you really not know?

6
00:00:27.144 --> 00:00:28.770
As you said,

7
00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.740
I'm going to meet my boss who is interested in me,

8
00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:34.550
I want you to answer,,,

9
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:36.120
my questions honestly,

10
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.220
How long have you been meeting him?

11
00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:42.890
What? I can't believe this,

12
00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:44.860
What do you mean how long?

13
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:45.960
Do you really not know?

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.560
I knew it from the start, That's why I was suspicious,

15
00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:53.500
There are so many young and energetic people out there,

16
00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:56.440
Why would he hire someone without any certificates or experience?

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.540
You've only done housework, and all you have is your pretty face,

18
00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:01.310
Why do you think he hired you?

19
00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:04.710
Two of you were close already,,,

20
00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:06.750
before we graduated our marriage,

21
00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:11.150
Cha Jung Ok helped two of you and deceived me, right?

22
00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:14.390
What? My goodness,

23
00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:16.660
Look, Mr, Lee Shin Mo,

24
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.230
I'm not going to look at anything, I'm still your husband,

25
00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:24.500
You're really dirty, cheap, and disgusting,

26
00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:29.400
If you wanted to leave me for him because you don't love me anymore,

27
00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.300
you could have said so,

28
00:01:31.308 --> 00:01:36.270
How dare you accuse me when I sacrificed my life for the family?

29
00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:39.780
You even accused me of having a mean personality,

30
00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:43.620
This is clearly a fraud,

31
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.860
It doesn't matter what happened, Everything is over from today,

32
00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:48.960
Pack your things and come back to the house,,,

33
00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:51.730
before I report you to the police,

34
00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:54.400
You also know, don't you?

35
00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.170
You're being embarrassingly unreasonable,

36
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't want to deal with you because it's ridiculous,

37
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:03.340
But let me say one thing,

38
00:02:03.907 --> 00:02:06.240
I am disgusted of men,,,

39
00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:09.580
because of you,

40
00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:12.310
So don't be unreasonable,,,

41
00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:14.410
and let people know that you have delusional jealousy,

42
00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:16.980
Just be quiet and stay still,

43
00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:20.060
Do you mean that you're not in a relationship with him?

44
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.560
I can't believe you,

45
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.890
Okay,

46
00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.100
Let's say that you're telling the truth,

47
00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:33.300
Also, let's say,,,

48
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.410
that you received that car because you're crazy for free stuff,

49
00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.740
But nothing will change,,,

50
00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:44.810
the fact that the car is a dirty bait to lure you,

51
00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:47.580
If you don't have any feelings for him, return that car,

52
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.110
What if I don't want to return it?

53
00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.720
What?

54
00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.060
Do you mean that you will live like that exchanging cars,,,

55
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.790
and feelings with him?

56
00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:03.800
Think as you like,

57
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:05.800
I've never thought about it,

58
00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:08.540
but I guess I should consider the possibility,

59
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.170
Even if that is true,

60
00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:13.640
whatever I exchange with him is,,,

61
00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:15.510
nothing of your concern,

62
00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:17.280
You don't have the right to say that,

63
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.380
Did we divorce? We only graduated our marriage,

64
00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:24.480
You're still my wife in legal documents,

65
00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:25.980
I'm still your husband,

66
00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.390
What kind of husband lets his wife have a relationship?

67
00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:32.460
Did you forget?

68
00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.760
You insisted on having an open relationship in the contract,

69
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:37.500
What?

70
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:39.600
What did you say?

71
00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:43.600
What will you do about relationships?

72
00:03:43.607 --> 00:03:45.670
It doesn't matter because we are not interested in it,

73
00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:47.010
What are you talking about?

74
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.910
I'm not sure about you, but I'm still eligible,

75
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.110
I want you to write this in clearly,

76
00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:56.180
We won't interfere with each other's relationships with another,

77
00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:00.560
Let's end this talk about the car and my boss,

78
00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:04.590
I'm sure that you know,,,

79
00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:06.330
that you have no right to talk about this,

80
00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.700
Give it to me,

81
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.240
What are you doing? Give it back,

82
00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.340
Hello, Young Hye?

83
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:24.140
We don't need it, Take your car back,

84
00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:25.780
What are you doing?

85
00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:27.920
Tell him that you don't need the car,

86
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.150
Are you crazy?

87
00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:36.390
The best thing I've done in life,,,

88
00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:38.960
is to graduate marriage with you,

89
00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:42.960
I'm disgusted by you,

90
00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.730
Gosh,

91
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.340
Hey, Young Hye,

92
00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:52.340
Young Hye,

93
00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:56.340
Gosh,

94
00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:00.010
It's strange,

95
00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:02.550
Did something happen to Young Hye?

96
00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:08.220
I'll close the store, You can leave first,

97
00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.890
Should I do that?

98
00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.090
I had to go somewhere,

99
00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:13.390
Please do me a favor,

100
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.530
Yes,

101
00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:23.400
As you said,

102
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.610
I'm going to meet my boss who is interested in me,

103
00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:30.780
I can't believe her,

104
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.480
Did you wait for me?

105
00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.650
Honey, what took you so long?

106
00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:39.350
Don't even mention it,

107
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.590
I don't know how he found out, but he was suspicious of our past,

108
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.230
I barely managed to escape him,

109
00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:45.720
I told you so,

110
00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.590
Just divorce him instead of graduating marriage with him,

111
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.400
I don't want to think about it,

112
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.460
Stop talking about him,

113
00:05:51.468 --> 00:05:53.100
I was so scared,

114
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.900
Don't worry,

115
00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:58.710
I'll protect you,,,

116
00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:00.340
so he won't make a fuss anymore,

117
00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:03.340
- I'll trust you, - Okay,

118
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.720
That's not it,

119
00:06:11.654 --> 00:06:13.150
I've been watching too many dramas,

120
00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:15.020
That's not right,

121
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.730
(Lee Shin Mo)

122
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.510
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment,

123
00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:44.290
Hey, Young Hye, Where are you right now?

124
00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:48.590
You're not seriously on your way to meet that jerk, right?

125
00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:53.600
If you meet him, I'm going to,,,

126
00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.530
throw myself out the window,

127
00:06:58.401 --> 00:06:59.800
Wait, this isn't right,

128
00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:03.340
Gosh, No, no, This sounds too pathetic,

129
00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:07.410
This is why marrying a beautiful woman,,,

130
00:07:07.777 --> 00:07:09.780
only brings trouble,

131
00:07:11.414 --> 00:07:14.780
I can't stop worrying about her even when she gets old,

132
00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:16.920
Goodness, how frustrating,

133
00:07:26.463 --> 00:07:27.730
- My gosh, - Young Hye,

134
00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:30.090
Hello, what brings you here?

135
00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.300
I could ask you the same thing,

136
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.800
You used your vacation day for your son's wedding,

137
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.470
But I should still close up the shop,

138
00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:40.610
I needed to prepare some stuff for the group reservation tomorrow,

139
00:07:40.643 --> 00:07:42.980
This just proves why I can trust you,

140
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:46.150
Oh, right, The phone call dropped rather strangely earlier,

141
00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:47.920
You're not in trouble, right?

142
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.090
No, I'm not, Please be on your way,

143
00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:54.920
Young Hye, Can you spare me an hour tomorrow?

144
00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:58.590
You and I need to go somewhere, It's a private matter,

145
00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:00.160
A private matter?

146
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.160
I'll take that as a yes then,

147
00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:18.150
I can't let you stay next to me,

148
00:08:18.781 --> 00:08:22.220
If you stay next to me, I'll lose two people,

149
00:08:22.352 --> 00:08:23.650
What should I do then?

150
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:27.290
I need to be next to him to be able to take or get something,

151
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:29.960
But there's no way to stay next to him,

152
00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:31.730
I told you before,,,

153
00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:36.260
about how your mother died,

154
00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:38.170
Keep that in mind,

155
00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:04.390
We'll aim for Kevin's weakness,

156
00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.130
You're going to do as I asked, right?

157
00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:14.500
You're going to reconcile with the chairman, okay?

158
00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:17.270
He's never going to give up on Ae Ri,

159
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.540
As long as Ae Ri works there, I don't want to work at the company,

160
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.040
I've been doing fine until now,

161
00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:24.910
I don't want to ride on someone's coattails either,

162
00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:26.680
Even if that someone is my father,

163
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:30.050
Dear me, That didn't sound cool at all,

164
00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.190
Are you more disappointed than me?

165
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.890
Because I forfeited my chance to become the heir?

166
00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:39.520
How did you know? My gosh, I struck gold,

167
00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:41.530
but I lost all of it because of you,

168
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:50.040
He has lived his whole life without a family,

169
00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:53.540
You're the only son he has in this world,

170
00:09:53.743 --> 00:09:55.410
You should be in his life,

171
00:09:55.712 --> 00:09:57.250
so he can rely on you,

172
00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:00.420
Please?

173
00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:40.890
Make no mistake,

174
00:10:44.594 --> 00:10:47.930
Timing is the most important, Don't be late,

175
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:14.390
I don't know how to start,

176
00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:17.930
I always believed that I could always improve,

177
00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:21.160
but there hasn't been a time when I'd been blinded like this,

178
00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:27.170
I am very embarrassed to even face you, Ru Ri,

179
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.370
I'm all right,

180
00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:33.410
I will forget everything that has happened to us,

181
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.640
For the past few weeks,

182
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.120
I have scarred you and your father, which can't be remedied,

183
00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:45.790
I will set up a meeting with your father,,,

184
00:11:45.988 --> 00:11:47.890
and apologize to him with respect,

185
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.690
but I hope you will be the first one to forgive me,

186
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.660
I am really all right, sir,

187
00:11:56.866 --> 00:11:59.300
My father used to tell me this,

188
00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:02.070
"People have eyes in front,"

189
00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:06.640
"so they can look forward to the future instead of looking back,"

190
00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:10.550
My father easily loses his temper,

191
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.650
but he won't hold it against you,

192
00:12:14.383 --> 00:12:16.120
Above all,

193
00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:18.790
it's better late than never,

194
00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:23.290
I'm glad that you and Manager Jung can mend your relationship,

195
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.790
I'm very happy for that,

196
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.500
It's all thanks to you, Ru Ri,

197
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.740
I'd never have trusted you without the recording from yesterday,

198
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.310
Tae Yang,

199
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.510
I'm sorry,

200
00:12:41.978 --> 00:12:43.880
I have made a big mistake,

201
00:12:45.448 --> 00:12:48.420
I think Ru Ri suffered more than I did,

202
00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:52.620
Please make sure that this never happens ever again,

203
00:12:53.456 --> 00:12:57.330
And for you and the company, you need to tighten your circle,

204
00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:00.530
I'm well aware of that,

205
00:13:01.964 --> 00:13:04.130
I cannot cut my ties with Ae Ri,

206
00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:07.740
I will have her removed from the company, Don't worry,

207
00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:19.810
Open it,

208
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.330
What is this?

209
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.030
It's the watch your mother gave me when we got married,

210
00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:41.070
I kept it even after your mother left,

211
00:13:41.504 --> 00:13:44.940
Now, I want you to keep it,

212
00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.140
Giving a watch as a gift means,,,

213
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:54.550
a promise to spend the rest of remaining time with the recipient,

214
00:13:55.952 --> 00:13:57.750
Your mother couldn't keep her promise,

215
00:13:57.987 --> 00:14:00.790
but I hope you will be able to keep the promise,

216
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.900
Will we be able to do that?

217
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.640
Give me that,

218
00:14:31.053 --> 00:14:32.190
Isn't this reassuring?

219
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.070
Hello? What is it?

220
00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:49.170
What? Are you sure?

221
00:14:51.007 --> 00:14:52.170
Okay,

222
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.640
What happened?

223
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.380
Ae Ri disappeared from the hospital,

224
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:00.780
Could she have been discharged?

225
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.690
I was quite harsh on her before coming here,

226
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:06.790
I think she's causing trouble again,

227
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.260
I'm sorry, but I must get going now,

228
00:15:10.593 --> 00:15:12.390
- I'll come with you, - There's no need,

229
00:15:12.628 --> 00:15:16.400
There's no need to spoil the mood, You're having a nice time today,

230
00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:18.870
I will take care of Ae Ri,

231
00:15:18.935 --> 00:15:20.230
Have a nice evening,

232
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.940
Please tell your father I'll call him next week,

233
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:29.840
- Goodbye, - Bye,

234
00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:51.170
(Dad)

235
00:16:06.449 --> 00:16:09.420
The phone is turned off, You will be connected to the voicemail box,

236
00:16:10.987 --> 00:16:12.420
Should I head to the hospital, sir?

237
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.660
Let's go straight to Ae Ri's studio,

238
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.420
I have a bad feeling about this, so you must hurry,

239
00:16:16.692 --> 00:16:17.830
Yes, sir,

240
00:16:28.304 --> 00:16:32.310
The chairman must have really loved your mother,

241
00:16:32.842 --> 00:16:36.780
That's probably why he kept this watch for over 30 years,

242
00:16:43.052 --> 00:16:46.550
Even yesterday, I was thinking about,,,

243
00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:50.420
whether or not I should break up with you,

244
00:16:51.694 --> 00:16:54.060
I didn't think things would work out so fast like this,

245
00:16:54.497 --> 00:16:56.160
I was great, wasn't I?

246
00:16:57.233 --> 00:16:59.930
Our parents are going to meet and make up soon,

247
00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:03.200
We can go to work starting tomorrow and get back on the projects,

248
00:17:06.976 --> 00:17:08.680
Are you even listening to me?

249
00:17:09.578 --> 00:17:10.950
Can you go home by yourself?

250
00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:14.280
I don't think I can stay here,

251
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:16.550
Is this because of Joo Ae Ri?

252
00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:18.050
I have a bad feeling,

253
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.850
I'll go with you,

254
00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:31.870
Jung Tae Yang,

255
00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:35.500
How dare you tear me apart from Dad?

256
00:17:37.073 --> 00:17:39.440
Let's see if things would go your way,

257
00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:58.960
The chairman will be arriving in 10 minutes,

258
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:03.430
(Deleting the message)

259
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:56.780
Director Park,

260
00:18:57.453 --> 00:18:59.380
What's happening? Is Ae Ri at home?

261
00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.650
I rang the bell several times, but she doesn't seem to be inside,

262
00:19:01.657 --> 00:19:03.220
So I was calling places she might head to,

263
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.220
Her phone is turned off,

264
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.220
If she's not here, where can she be?

265
00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:08.460
I don't know,

266
00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.430
It won't be easy for her to move in that state,

267
00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:14.000
Have you any guesses?

268
00:19:16.172 --> 00:19:18.540
I'm just worried that she might have had a bad idea,

269
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:19.870
What do you think?

270
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:24.280
This was placed on the hospital bed,

271
00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:38.530
I'm sorry, Dad,

272
00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:40.730
I miss Mom,

273
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.530
I'm going to Mom's side,

274
00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:43.960
What's this about?

275
00:19:43.966 --> 00:19:46.060
After you scolded her,

276
00:19:46.068 --> 00:19:47.740
I scolded her too,

277
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.140
I told her that she didn't deserve to be new to you after causing,,,

278
00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:54.510
the pain to Manager Jung and Lee Ru Ri,

279
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.440
I told her to go back to America,

280
00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.210
Maybe that's why,,,

281
00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:03.320
Gosh, she's determined to upset me until the end,

282
00:20:04.987 --> 00:20:06.490
Don't mind her,

283
00:20:06.655 --> 00:20:08.320
She'll come back after a few days,

284
00:20:08.324 --> 00:20:09.490
Sir,

285
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.030
She said she misses her mom,

286
00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:14.500
You know,,,

287
00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:17.330
how she died,

288
00:20:26.442 --> 00:20:27.910
Call the janitor,,,

289
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.680
and ask them to open the door with the master key,

290
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:44.530
Ae Ri, Ae Ri!

291
00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:49.030
Ae Ri, Ae Ri,

292
00:20:50.532 --> 00:20:52.200
Ae Ri! Ae Ri!

293
00:20:52.234 --> 00:20:54.540
Wake up, Ae Ri!

294
00:20:58.741 --> 00:21:01.680
What's happening? Ae Ri! Wake up, Ae Ri!

295
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.040
Ae Ri! Ae Ri!

296
00:21:04.546 --> 00:21:06.410
I think she drank this with the wine,

297
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.450
Call the ambulance, Call 911!

298
00:21:10.719 --> 00:21:14.120
Ae Ri! Ae Ri! Wake up!

299
00:21:14.757 --> 00:21:16.490
Ae Ri! Ae Ri!

300
00:21:23.999 --> 00:21:26.260
Stay in the car, I'll go by myself,

301
00:21:26.268 --> 00:21:29.340
No, I have a bad feeling about this,

302
00:21:29.638 --> 00:21:31.040
I want to go with you,

303
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:54.090
Who are you?

304
00:21:56.298 --> 00:21:58.030
We're Ae Ri's family,

305
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.430
Did something happen here?

306
00:22:00.436 --> 00:22:02.040
Don't even talk about it,

307
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:05.070
She was just carried off to the hospital, Didn't you see?

308
00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:06.970
Why was she carried off to the hospital?

309
00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:08.940
She drank some drugs,

310
00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:10.710
If her father hadn't come in time,

311
00:22:10.713 --> 00:22:12.410
she'd have been in big trouble

312
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.180
What kind of drugs?

313
00:22:14.216 --> 00:22:16.720
I,,, Wait,

314
00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:22.760
I heard she drank this with wine,

315
00:22:38.173 --> 00:22:40.300
You can pay Han Gyul,,,

316
00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:42.040
for what you did to him instead,

317
00:22:42.678 --> 00:22:45.550
Give the love you couldn't give him to Han Gyul,

318
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:47.110
and you can pay her instead,

319
00:22:47.716 --> 00:22:50.380
As long as you and I raise Han Gyul together,

320
00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:52.090
it's all fine,

321
00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:55.860
As much as we love Han Gyul,

322
00:22:57.393 --> 00:23:01.260
someone else probably loved my brother,

323
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:03.860
All right,

324
00:23:05.434 --> 00:23:08.340
I can repent on the sin,,,

325
00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:12.940
I committed 40 years ago by paying back to Han Gyul,

326
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.540
Yes?

327
00:23:15.778 --> 00:23:19.510
Ma'am, Yeon Ju asked you to come out and have dessert,

328
00:23:20.249 --> 00:23:23.510
Are you telling me to die?

329
00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:27.380
A dessert at night for people over 60 years old,,,

330
00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:29.920
only makes them fat,

331
00:23:29.925 --> 00:23:32.620
Just tell the young people to have them all,

332
00:23:32.628 --> 00:23:36.190
But you should come out and at least pretend to eat,

333
00:23:36.198 --> 00:23:38.730
If you come back to your room right after dinner,

334
00:23:38.734 --> 00:23:42.940
the doctor that came here for the first time would feel uncomfortable,

335
00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:47.940
He's even brought a child with him,

336
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.110
Are you going to taunt me just because you're more educated?

337
00:23:52.614 --> 00:23:54.450
Before you get hurt,

338
00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.780
close your mouth and shut it,

339
00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:01.190
(You should come out quickly,)

340
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.090
Gosh,

341
00:24:06.228 --> 00:24:09.760
She's using sign language now, Gosh,

342
00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:11.430
What?

343
00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:15.870
Gosh, what's she doing?

344
00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:17.870
I can't believe this,

345
00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:26.410
Yeon Ju, where will I be staying from now on?

346
00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:29.380
Why? Do you want to sleep?

347
00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:32.990
Just wait a little, Grandma will tell you,

348
00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:36.220
She doesn't need to, She's taking a rest because she's tired,

349
00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:38.790
You should go with me,

350
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:43.300
No, no, no, That's for me to do,

351
00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:47.630
Han Gyul, do you want to know where your room is?

352
00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:49.800
Take my hand,

353
00:24:49.872 --> 00:24:51.770
You're going to see it soon!

354
00:24:58.046 --> 00:24:59.350
Let's follow them,

355
00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:04.590
Surprise!

356
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.290
This is your room,

357
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.790
- Oh, my, - Take a look,

358
00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:16.530
It's a room for a princess,

359
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.130
Mom and I spent two days on this,,,

360
00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:23.030
to finish this before she arrived,

361
00:25:23.038 --> 00:25:24.740
You overdid yourself,

362
00:25:25.807 --> 00:25:27.370
Gosh, my back hurts,

363
00:25:27.376 --> 00:25:30.570
Han Gyul, do you like,,,

364
00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:33.710
your amazing room?

365
00:25:34.483 --> 00:25:38.220
Yes, I can only say, "oh my goodness",

366
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.980
Oh, my, Listen to her,

367
00:25:39.988 --> 00:25:42.150
Did your aunt teach you that?

368
00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:43.260
Yes,

369
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:50.090
Grandma, is this really my room? For real?

370
00:25:50.098 --> 00:25:51.700
Of course,

371
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.230
Would I sleep here in this hectic room?

372
00:25:55.237 --> 00:25:57.770
Or would your tall father sleep here?

373
00:25:57.773 --> 00:26:01.000
It's going to be your room until you get married,

374
00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:03.110
I'll get it changed again,,,

375
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:05.510
when you go to high school,

376
00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:08.020
Oh, my,

377
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.250
Oh, my, What should I do?

378
00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:15.220
Gosh, if I give you something better than this,

379
00:26:15.223 --> 00:26:17.750
you might strangle me to death,

380
00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:19.560
Wait, Grandma,

381
00:26:19.561 --> 00:26:22.130
I have a present for you,

382
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.260
Oh, my,

383
00:26:23.699 --> 00:26:25.600
- She's funny, - A present?

384
00:26:25.634 --> 00:26:27.130
She's going to give me a present,

385
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:31.200
What is this?

386
00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:32.610
It's a crown,

387
00:26:34.209 --> 00:26:36.780
She made it to give it to you,

388
00:26:37.746 --> 00:26:41.250
Hat Granny, the grandma from America said,,,

389
00:26:41.516 --> 00:26:43.320
that if you wear a hat like this,

390
00:26:43.385 --> 00:26:46.190
you'll not die early and live for a long time,

391
00:26:46.922 --> 00:26:49.320
You're the oldest,

392
00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:53.030
Don't die, wear this, and live for a long time,

393
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.300
Oh, my, I'm so touched,

394
00:26:56.131 --> 00:26:57.290
Okay,

395
00:26:57.299 --> 00:27:00.730
I was going to live until 100,

396
00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:03.230
But I guess I will have to live until 200,,,

397
00:27:03.238 --> 00:27:06.070
because of this hat,

398
00:27:07.242 --> 00:27:09.470
Oh, my goodness,

399
00:27:09.478 --> 00:27:12.180
Oh, my, I guess it's effective,,,

400
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.650
that your aunt has been saying it in native English,

401
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.380
Say it one more time, How do you say it?

402
00:27:16.652 --> 00:27:18.750
Oh, my goodness,

403
00:27:24.126 --> 00:27:26.760
I was worried how they would get along,

404
00:27:26.962 --> 00:27:28.460
I'm thankful that it wasn't bad,

405
00:27:30.932 --> 00:27:33.130
- Why? - I'm just happy,

406
00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:35.100
Why are you so happy?

407
00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:36.940
Because of everything,

408
00:27:36.972 --> 00:27:39.000
What kind of answer is that?

409
00:27:39.007 --> 00:27:40.440
Are you a maniac?

410
00:27:41.143 --> 00:27:42.480
I'm serious,

411
00:27:42.678 --> 00:27:45.550
At this moment, I'm just happy because of everything,

412
00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:48.280
It all happened because of you,

413
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.750
What did I do?

414
00:27:50.218 --> 00:27:53.050
You realize how precious things are when you lose it,

415
00:27:53.622 --> 00:27:56.120
Everything that I took granted in the past is,,,

416
00:27:56.158 --> 00:27:58.490
precious to me now, and I'm thankful,

417
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.090
We ate at the same table after several months,

418
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.060
I made tea for you,

419
00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:07.730
and we're standing next to each other brushing our teeth,

420
00:28:08.303 --> 00:28:09.870
I'm so happy of these little things,

421
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:12.270
I could cry,

422
00:28:12.474 --> 00:28:14.980
It means you're getting old if you appreciate the little things,

423
00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:17.140
I guess you're getting old,

424
00:28:17.412 --> 00:28:20.010
The "Cheongdam Barbie" has become an old married woman,

425
00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:23.950
Of course, my daughter is already seven years old,

426
00:28:28.423 --> 00:28:29.950
Honey, what's wrong?

427
00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:31.730
What is wrong suddenly? Does it hurt?

428
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.630
My heart,,,

429
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.730
sunk,

430
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.830
I was touched,

431
00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:43.900
I was so surprised,

432
00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:47.840
Thank you, Let's live happily,

433
00:28:49.044 --> 00:28:52.950
I'm going to be a really good wife and mom,

434
00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:55.380
Just like my mom did for me,

435
00:28:55.383 --> 00:28:58.620
I'm going to make Han Gyul the happiest daughter in the world,

436
00:28:58.954 --> 00:29:00.280
Don't try too hard,

437
00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:02.290
You're already a good mom,

438
00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:04.690
This is just the start,

439
00:29:04.693 --> 00:29:06.830
To be honest, I'm really excited and looking forward to it,

440
00:29:07.129 --> 00:29:10.760
I'll really be a mom when I send Han Gyul to kindergarten tomorrow,

441
00:29:11.967 --> 00:29:15.500
Look, just thinking about it makes my heart race,

442
00:29:52.007 --> 00:29:55.110
I prepared some side dishes, Just cook some rice and eat it together,

443
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.980
Are you that worried about me?

444
00:29:57.913 --> 00:29:59.740
Of course, I'm worried,

445
00:29:59.748 --> 00:30:01.880
Women can take good care of themselves,

446
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.680
But men become a mess,

447
00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:11.220
That hag,

448
00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:14.530
She's pretending to be helpful after all she did to me,

449
00:30:15.263 --> 00:30:16.800
What is her true feeling?

450
00:30:17.732 --> 00:30:19.530
If she's that worried about me,

451
00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:22.570
she should have given the car back right away,

452
00:30:23.138 --> 00:30:27.710
Why is she still driving that dirty car that has evil intention?

453
00:30:31.713 --> 00:30:33.680
I knew that this would happen,

454
00:30:35.217 --> 00:30:36.480
She's going to apologize,

455
00:30:41.656 --> 00:30:43.260
Dong Ki,

456
00:30:43.959 --> 00:30:46.330
Did you call me early in the morning to go hiking?

457
00:30:46.528 --> 00:30:50.430
That's not why I called, Do you remember Choi Theresa?

458
00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:52.030
Theresa?

459
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.830
Who is that?

460
00:30:54.069 --> 00:30:56.300
She was the singer of the women's university band,,,

461
00:30:56.338 --> 00:30:57.840
when we were in the university band,

462
00:30:57.973 --> 00:30:59.340
She was really pretty,

463
00:30:59.507 --> 00:31:01.880
She really wants to see you,

464
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.080
Why would she want to see me?

465
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.550
She said that you were her first love,

466
00:31:08.383 --> 00:31:10.280
I gave her your number,

467
00:31:10.318 --> 00:31:12.620
That's okay,

468
00:31:13.221 --> 00:31:15.520
People say that you should never meet your first love again,

469
00:31:15.891 --> 00:31:17.420
I'm not interested, I'm going to hang up,

470
00:31:20.028 --> 00:31:23.060
First love? That's ridiculous, What is he talking about?

471
00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:27.000
Wait a minute,

472
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.810
How will I get Young Hye back?

473
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.310
Okay,

474
00:31:40.382 --> 00:31:43.050
Where are we going?

475
00:31:43.518 --> 00:31:44.880
I already told you,

476
00:31:45.754 --> 00:31:48.760
I asked you to spare an hour for a very private purpose,

477
00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:51.990
What is that,,,

478
00:31:52.294 --> 00:31:53.690
very private purpose?

479
00:31:54.262 --> 00:31:55.430
We're here,

480
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.360
Turn right over there,

481
00:32:04.239 --> 00:32:06.110
(Daehan General Hospital)

482
00:32:09.477 --> 00:32:11.780
Mr, Lee, look at this color,

483
00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.180
Isn't it so beautiful?

484
00:32:14.249 --> 00:32:16.880
Try this on,

485
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:21.290
You should answer me when I talk to you,

486
00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:24.620
Why are you so deep in thought?

487
00:32:24.726 --> 00:32:25.860
Mr, Lee!

488
00:32:27.395 --> 00:32:30.860
You wanted to tell me something, Why did you bring me here?

489
00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:34.730
I wanted to change your look,,,

490
00:32:34.736 --> 00:32:36.730
because you always dress so dull,

491
00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:40.070
That's why I brought you here, What's wrong with you?

492
00:32:42.277 --> 00:32:44.780
Something happened, didn't it?

493
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.280
Mr, Lee, didn't you want to see me to talk comfortably,,,

494
00:32:50.518 --> 00:32:53.280
because you are tired and frustrated,,,

495
00:32:53.288 --> 00:32:55.090
and you want to talk to someone,,,

496
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.060
but you can't because it hurts your pride?

497
00:32:59.961 --> 00:33:02.260
Just tell me then,

498
00:33:02.263 --> 00:33:04.300
What is bothering you? What happened?

499
00:33:14.709 --> 00:33:17.270
That's a misunderstanding,

500
00:33:17.278 --> 00:33:19.880
It turned out that this was fabricated,

501
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:21.210
I don't care whether it's fabricated or not,

502
00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.020
Please be objective and tell me how her boss is like,

503
00:33:25.987 --> 00:33:29.460
If he wanted to be in a relationship with you,

504
00:33:30.492 --> 00:33:31.760
would you accept it?

505
00:33:32.494 --> 00:33:33.730
Gosh,

506
00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:43.100
Does he want to meet me?

507
00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:47.040
Why would that bother you? You're so silly,

508
00:33:47.242 --> 00:33:49.540
If he wants to meet me,

509
00:33:50.011 --> 00:33:53.180
it would be the honor of my family,

510
00:33:53.181 --> 00:33:55.610
I'd thank him very much, I don't know what to do,

511
00:33:55.617 --> 00:33:57.280
You're making me shy,

512
00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:59.220
Does it make you that happy?

513
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.990
Of course,

514
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.620
He's young, graduated from S University,

515
00:34:04.893 --> 00:34:07.090
rich, and he's a doctor,

516
00:34:07.529 --> 00:34:11.800
He's a dream for middle-aged women,

517
00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:13.970
Last time I saw him,

518
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:17.400
the way he talked and his voice were very nice like a gentleman,

519
00:34:17.439 --> 00:34:20.340
I guess it's because,,,

520
00:34:20.341 --> 00:34:23.510
he's an intellectual who stayed overseas for a long time,

521
00:34:23.678 --> 00:34:27.310
I don't know what to do,

522
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:30.980
He's not the dream of anyone,

523
00:34:31.286 --> 00:34:33.220
He's a complete player,,,

524
00:34:33.221 --> 00:34:35.620
seeing the way he lowers his voice when he talks,

525
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:40.860
Can't you judge a man properly after all these years?

526
00:34:40.862 --> 00:34:44.860
You are being deceived by a womanizer,

527
00:34:46.134 --> 00:34:49.900
Mr, Lee, why are you so upset?

528
00:34:49.904 --> 00:34:52.470
How can I not be upset?

529
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:56.010
That man is trying to seduce,,,

530
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.440
my wife by giving her a car,

531
00:34:59.447 --> 00:35:00.680
Oh, my,

532
00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:03.580
I can't believe this,

533
00:35:03.718 --> 00:35:05.720
Is this why you're making such a fuss?

534
00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:11.420
I thought you wife bought him a car,

535
00:35:11.626 --> 00:35:14.860
Receiving a car isn't a problem,

536
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:16.890
Nothing is free in this world,

537
00:35:16.898 --> 00:35:20.160
That man was expecting something,,,

538
00:35:20.168 --> 00:35:22.970
when he gave her that car,

539
00:35:23.671 --> 00:35:26.670
Don't you understand?

540
00:35:27.008 --> 00:35:28.840
Like this,

541
00:35:29.077 --> 00:35:32.410
He wants something like this,

542
00:35:32.614 --> 00:35:33.810
Like this,

543
00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:37.880
I can't believe this,

544
00:35:38.419 --> 00:35:42.890
Did you get mad at her again because of that?

545
00:35:42.924 --> 00:35:44.060
Of course,

546
00:35:44.259 --> 00:35:46.520
She received that not knowing anything,

547
00:35:46.528 --> 00:35:48.330
How can I leave her alone?

548
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.830
Gosh,

549
00:35:50.265 --> 00:35:52.730
This is why she separated from you,

550
00:35:53.268 --> 00:35:57.970
There is only one way to defeat,,,

551
00:35:57.972 --> 00:36:00.910
a competitive opponent,

552
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:06.210
That is to become a more wonderful man than him,,,

553
00:36:06.281 --> 00:36:09.280
to charm Mrs, Hong,

554
00:36:09.817 --> 00:36:10.980
That's the only way,

555
00:36:29.904 --> 00:36:31.100
Thank you,

556
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.280
Do you want to go for a cup of tea?

557
00:36:47.722 --> 00:36:48.790
Yes,

558
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.630
First of all, keep yourself neat,

559
00:36:59.901 --> 00:37:01.900
Take off that rice,

560
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.940
Don't just say you love her,

561
00:37:12.113 --> 00:37:14.780
With sweet words,

562
00:37:14.782 --> 00:37:17.220
give her a present,

563
00:37:26.527 --> 00:37:27.830
Hong Young Hye,

564
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.460
Do you want to,,,

565
00:37:31.266 --> 00:37:32.530
go get some streusel bread,,,

566
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:35.200
like we used to?

567
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.770
Gosh,

568
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:44.840
I can't believe I'm doing this at this age,

569
00:37:44.846 --> 00:37:46.950
My goodness,

570
00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:53.390
What's wrong?

571
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:55.560
Are you all right?

572
00:37:57.592 --> 00:38:00.060
I'm a doctor, but I get scared easily,

573
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:04.930
Actually my whole family has a weak stomach,

574
00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:08.370
My father and brother died of stomach cancer,

575
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.410
I had a biopsy because I've had pain in my stomach since last year,

576
00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:15.070
I see,

577
00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:17.340
I was getting the result today,

578
00:38:17.945 --> 00:38:20.510
It'd be lonely to be diagnosed with cancer alone,

579
00:38:20.648 --> 00:38:22.180
so I asked you to come,

580
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:24.620
Good job,

581
00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:26.750
What about the result?

582
00:38:27.322 --> 00:38:30.520
It's a positive gastric ulcer, They want to treat it for two months,

583
00:38:31.192 --> 00:38:32.660
I'm glad to hear that,

584
00:38:32.994 --> 00:38:36.560
Why did you leave it until that point?

585
00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:40.800
It happened because I've been busy,

586
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:44.230
Do you remember what I asked last time?

587
00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:46.070
Why you didn't get remarried,

588
00:38:50.378 --> 00:38:52.310
It was an acute leukemia,

589
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:55.110
She left all of a sudden,,,

590
00:38:55.116 --> 00:38:56.980
that I couldn't believe it for a while,

591
00:38:59.654 --> 00:39:00.820
I see,

592
00:39:00.822 --> 00:39:03.920
Do you know how surprised I was to see you at first?

593
00:39:04.325 --> 00:39:05.420
Why?

594
00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:08.090
Your voice sounded just like my wife,

595
00:39:10.131 --> 00:39:11.760
I used to,,,

596
00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:14.370
listen to her voice saved on my phone when I missed her,

597
00:39:15.403 --> 00:39:18.870
Anyway, that's why you looked familiar from the start,

598
00:39:19.807 --> 00:39:21.740
Can this be a fate?

599
00:39:23.878 --> 00:39:25.950
What? She's not here?

600
00:39:26.547 --> 00:39:29.380
Yes, She went out with the boss,

601
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.720
Where did they go?

602
00:39:32.053 --> 00:39:33.150
Pardon?

603
00:39:35.356 --> 00:39:37.320
Never mind, Forget about it,

604
00:39:37.992 --> 00:39:39.020
Go back to your work,

605
00:39:39.026 --> 00:39:40.390
Okay,

606
00:39:56.611 --> 00:39:57.940
Hey, Dong Ki,

607
00:39:58.112 --> 00:40:01.710
Let me meet Choi Dae Se or whatever the name is,

608
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.450
Okay, Set up a date,

609
00:40:07.188 --> 00:40:10.060
Hong Young Hye, You're not the one on a roll,

610
00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:12.890
I'll be on a roll too from now on,

611
00:40:33.548 --> 00:40:35.180
Come here,

612
00:40:39.554 --> 00:40:40.650
Thank you,

613
00:40:41.088 --> 00:40:42.390
Kiss,

614
00:40:56.571 --> 00:40:58.370
The hospital just called,

615
00:40:59.106 --> 00:41:00.270
How's Ae Ri?

616
00:41:00.508 --> 00:41:02.240
She fell asleep after getting a tranquilizer,

617
00:41:02.243 --> 00:41:03.580
Is she okay now?

618
00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:07.380
Luckily, you found her early that they washed out her stomach,

619
00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:09.850
So she's safe, but,,,

620
00:41:09.984 --> 00:41:11.120
But what?

621
00:41:11.519 --> 00:41:13.390
She's mentally unstable,

622
00:41:13.921 --> 00:41:15.990
She should not be stressed,

623
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:19.330
Her mother died the same way,

624
00:41:20.361 --> 00:41:22.090
I'm worried in many ways,

625
00:41:25.132 --> 00:41:26.960
The legal team called,

626
00:41:26.968 --> 00:41:29.230
Assigning Jung Tae Yang as an executive,,,

627
00:41:29.237 --> 00:41:30.970
will be done by the end of this week,

628
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.910
Stock transfer's going smoothly,

629
00:41:35.843 --> 00:41:38.950
So what do you think I should do?

630
00:41:39.647 --> 00:41:41.210
If Ae Ri stays with me,

631
00:41:41.649 --> 00:41:44.180
Jung Tae Yang will never return to the company,

632
00:41:44.285 --> 00:41:45.990
It's a difficult decision,

633
00:41:46.988 --> 00:41:48.920
but you shouldn't be swayed by affection,

634
00:41:49.824 --> 00:41:52.090
For the company or for you,

635
00:41:53.127 --> 00:41:55.430
I think you should kick her out,

636
00:41:56.898 --> 00:42:00.100
What if she really goes wrong?

637
00:42:00.301 --> 00:42:02.500
That's sad, but we can't help it,

638
00:42:03.037 --> 00:42:06.140
You should choose your own child over a stepdaughter,

639
00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:12.510
I need to go see her, Get the car ready,

640
00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:27.790
- So Won, We're here, - Yes,

641
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:31.800
Long time no see,

642
00:42:32.033 --> 00:42:33.470
Congratulations on your remarriage,

643
00:42:34.168 --> 00:42:36.970
Thank you, You should come hang out at my house,

644
00:42:37.572 --> 00:42:39.010
Invite me any time,

645
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.570
Did you say you have a question?

646
00:42:45.846 --> 00:42:48.550
I'm curious what this medicine is,

647
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.890
This is a veterinary anesthetic,

648
00:42:59.493 --> 00:43:01.090
A veterinary anesthetic?

649
00:43:01.696 --> 00:43:05.200
What happens if a person drinks it?

650
00:43:05.466 --> 00:43:07.630
Is it life threatening?

651
00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:09.640
No, not with this amount,

652
00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:11.500
Three bottles would be lethal,

653
00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:14.270
Did someone drink this?

654
00:43:14.742 --> 00:43:18.510
Yes, But if someone knew this before drinking it,

655
00:43:18.512 --> 00:43:20.210
that person didn't intend to die, right?

656
00:43:21.048 --> 00:43:22.980
If they knew,

657
00:43:23.618 --> 00:43:24.780
maybe,

658
00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:28.620
You were right,

659
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.820
Joo Ae Ri put on a show to capture Chairman Kevin's heart,

660
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.200
You should choose your own child over a stepdaughter,

661
00:43:41.669 --> 00:43:44.240
That's sad, but we can't help it,

662
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:51.270
I want to be a useful daughter,

663
00:43:51.278 --> 00:43:52.510
So,,,

664
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:55.310
forgive me one more time,

665
00:43:56.417 --> 00:43:58.480
Let me stay beside you,

666
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:17.600
Everything about Joo Ae Ri's a lie except for breathing,

667
00:44:17.672 --> 00:44:20.510
Still, you shouldn't make a hasty decision,

668
00:44:21.676 --> 00:44:23.140
I can't delay it anymore,

669
00:44:24.178 --> 00:44:26.550
The longer she stays next to Father,

670
00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:28.910
the more harm she does to others,

671
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.120
But,,,

672
00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:34.750
do you think she did all this alone?

673
00:44:36.824 --> 00:44:39.620
I mean from the new menu poster incident,,,

674
00:44:39.627 --> 00:44:41.060
to now,

675
00:44:41.529 --> 00:44:43.660
don't you think it's too much for her to plan it alone?

676
00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:46.970
If she was born with it,

677
00:44:47.168 --> 00:44:48.870
she could do it alone,

678
00:45:03.651 --> 00:45:05.220
I wasn't myself,

679
00:45:05.986 --> 00:45:07.450
I thought I could have you back,,,

680
00:45:08.823 --> 00:45:11.150
if Chairman Kevin disappeared,

681
00:45:11.158 --> 00:45:12.320
Disappeared?

682
00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:16.300
Did you try to pull off the respirator or something?

683
00:45:16.731 --> 00:45:18.460
Have you gone insane?

684
00:45:21.736 --> 00:45:23.300
He's gone mad,

685
00:45:26.207 --> 00:45:27.570
It smells good,

686
00:45:27.942 --> 00:45:30.270
What brings you to kitchen all of a sudden?

687
00:45:30.277 --> 00:45:31.410
Gosh,

688
00:45:32.012 --> 00:45:33.380
How dare you put your hand on me?

689
00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.880
Have you forgotten that we agreed to act friendly only in front of kids?

690
00:45:38.486 --> 00:45:40.920
Mom, Are you having a fight with Dad?

691
00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:43.820
Not even the couple spa worked?

692
00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:45.860
No, It's nothing,

693
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.890
He said his arm hurts, I was massaging him,

694
00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:51.200
- Is it good? - It's good,

695
00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:54.200
Your touch is always the best,

696
00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:56.500
Kiss me,

697
00:45:57.738 --> 00:45:59.300
Stop it,

698
00:45:59.306 --> 00:46:02.240
It's not the first time, You're embarrassing me,

699
00:46:02.243 --> 00:46:04.010
- Come on, Kiss me, - What are you doing?

700
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:06.380
- Kiss me, - Stop it, Let me go,

701
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.110
Wait, I'm sorry,

702
00:46:10.918 --> 00:46:12.150
Hello?

703
00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:13.750
Honey, Honey,

704
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.350
Are they really good now?

705
00:46:17.358 --> 00:46:19.160
I'm not sure,

706
00:46:29.236 --> 00:46:30.640
Are you awake?

707
00:46:35.609 --> 00:46:37.740
Help me sit up,

708
00:46:38.612 --> 00:46:41.680
Stay still, The doctor advised you to take a rest,

709
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:50.560
Why did you come here?

710
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.060
Nothing,,,

711
00:46:55.529 --> 00:46:57.360
comes easy for me,

712
00:46:59.633 --> 00:47:01.430
I was going to get lost,,,

713
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:05.400
just like you wanted so that I could do you some good,

714
00:47:08.108 --> 00:47:10.510
Why did you save me?

715
00:47:11.846 --> 00:47:13.710
Or did the director find me?

716
00:47:14.648 --> 00:47:16.680
Did you have to save me even if you didn't want to?

717
00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:19.550
Ae Ri, what are you talking about?

718
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.620
He's been so worried about you,

719
00:47:24.191 --> 00:47:25.390
Really?

720
00:47:26.193 --> 00:47:27.430
I'm sorry,

721
00:47:27.628 --> 00:47:29.700
but I don't need you to worry about me,

722
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:32.200
You should worry about Jung Tae Yang instead,

723
00:47:33.133 --> 00:47:35.970
Your fake daughter, who is a worthless burden to you,

724
00:47:36.904 --> 00:47:38.600
will leave you forever,

725
00:47:41.842 --> 00:47:43.040
You scum,

726
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:50.720
I'm sorry,

727
00:47:51.986 --> 00:47:54.250
It's my fault that I made you lonely,

728
00:47:55.189 --> 00:47:57.560
It's also my fault that I made you like this,

729
00:47:58.425 --> 00:48:01.260
It's all my fault,

730
00:48:02.029 --> 00:48:03.200
I'm sorry,

731
00:48:04.298 --> 00:48:06.100
I don't need anything,

732
00:48:07.668 --> 00:48:10.240
Only if I can be next to you,

733
00:48:11.438 --> 00:48:14.870
I really don't need anything else,

734
00:48:23.717 --> 00:48:25.280
Stop with your show,

735
00:48:32.192 --> 00:48:35.090
I searched about the drug you took,

736
00:48:35.963 --> 00:48:37.930
With that much dosage, it'll just be a sleeping pill,

737
00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:39.830
It won't kill you,

738
00:48:40.234 --> 00:48:43.000
If you thought you could be forgiven,,,

739
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:46.240
for your sins like this, you're mistaken,

740
00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:49.010
What are you doing to a sick girl?

741
00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:50.440
You should leave,

742
00:48:50.444 --> 00:48:53.850
Father, you shouldn't believe her tears,

743
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:57.450
If you believe her again and keep her by your side,

744
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:59.120
she'll keep doing evil things,

745
00:49:00.087 --> 00:49:02.050
You should stop this for her,

746
00:49:02.156 --> 00:49:03.420
I told you to leave,

747
00:49:03.757 --> 00:49:05.660
- Leave, - Father,

748
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.930
You should leave now,

749
00:49:09.263 --> 00:49:10.700
Tae Yang, let's go,

750
00:49:11.298 --> 00:49:12.460
No,

751
00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:15.230
I want to talk to him,

752
00:49:19.073 --> 00:49:23.040
Tae Yang, are you so upset that I didn't end up dead?

753
00:49:23.677 --> 00:49:27.950
Is that why you searched about the drug I took?

754
00:49:29.316 --> 00:49:30.720
It's so scary,

755
00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:34.620
I didn't know how much I'd need to die, I just wanted to die,

756
00:49:35.422 --> 00:49:37.420
How can you accuse me like this?

757
00:49:38.692 --> 00:49:41.190
Would you have done this to me if we were blood related?

758
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:44.460
I barely came back alive,

759
00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:46.930
How can you say this to me?

760
00:49:47.468 --> 00:49:49.370
How can you say this is a show?

761
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:52.040
Who would make a show by risking the only life one has?

762
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.470
Stop it,

763
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.940
I don't want to get involved with you,

764
00:49:58.879 --> 00:50:01.210
Let's go outside, Let's talk outside,

765
00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:04.550
No, you should tell us right here,

766
00:50:05.152 --> 00:50:08.250
You should choose between us,

767
00:50:09.156 --> 00:50:10.320
Tae Yang,

768
00:50:15.229 --> 00:50:17.700
I won't leave you no matter what,

769
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.370
Even if you make me leave,

770
00:50:21.969 --> 00:50:23.540
I'll stay with you,

771
00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:31.180
Tae Yang, let's talk about this later,

772
00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:35.210
I'll explain everything to you so that you can understand,

773
00:50:35.215 --> 00:50:36.380
All right,

774
00:50:39.653 --> 00:50:41.350
Then I'll leave your side,

775
00:50:50.998 --> 00:50:53.230
Tae Yang, Tae Yang,

776
00:51:26.767 --> 00:51:27.930
You're upset, aren't you?

777
00:51:28.569 --> 00:51:30.240
It took you so long to meet your father,

778
00:51:31.438 --> 00:51:33.070
Do you think it was my fault?

779
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.510
No,

780
00:51:34.808 --> 00:51:38.010
With Joo Ae Ri by our side, we'll all die of cancer,

781
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:39.340
You did well,

782
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.950
You made the right choice,

783
00:51:42.649 --> 00:51:44.220
But it's a little sad now that we are both jobless,

784
00:51:45.285 --> 00:51:48.250
There's a big restaurant opening in Daegu, I'll apply there,

785
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:51.150
Daegu? It's great there,

786
00:51:51.158 --> 00:51:53.490
Should we start our new life there?

787
00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:55.330
We're a team of two, right?

788
00:51:57.898 --> 00:52:00.030
Who taught you to be so calm all the time?

789
00:52:01.068 --> 00:52:03.100
I'm blinded by love and can't see anything else,

790
00:52:05.939 --> 00:52:08.410
But there's one thing I can't quite get over with,

791
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:10.270
What is it?

792
00:52:10.277 --> 00:52:12.840
I don't know what Joo Ae Ri is after,

793
00:52:13.981 --> 00:52:15.210
What do you mean?

794
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:20.150
If she wants something bigger than to marring you,

795
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.350
the chairman could be in danger,

796
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.590
No, She was on good terms with the chairman,,,

797
00:52:29.596 --> 00:52:31.490
before you appeared,

798
00:52:31.498 --> 00:52:32.970
So nothing will happen, right?

799
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.010
Okay, Okay, All right, Bye,

800
00:52:49.283 --> 00:52:50.550
Hey,

801
00:52:50.551 --> 00:52:53.720
you should prepare food for Han Gyul,

802
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.050
She'll come home after studying hard at the kindergarten,

803
00:52:57.057 --> 00:52:58.650
But, ma'am,

804
00:52:58.659 --> 00:53:01.830
I'm a little worried about your granddaughter,

805
00:53:02.029 --> 00:53:03.200
What about her?

806
00:53:03.263 --> 00:53:06.470
She takes after the doctor,

807
00:53:06.967 --> 00:53:08.530
but she has dark skin,

808
00:53:08.669 --> 00:53:12.900
She looks healthy, That's good, Why would that be a problem?

809
00:53:13.207 --> 00:53:15.670
You've lived here for 20 years,

810
00:53:15.676 --> 00:53:18.740
You're going to lie and say it's your daughter's child,

811
00:53:18.745 --> 00:53:20.610
But if a big child appears suddenly,

812
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:23.220
what will the people say about her behind your back?

813
00:53:23.317 --> 00:53:27.250
So? What are you trying to say?

814
00:53:27.321 --> 00:53:30.490
Even without the situation, she has dark skin,

815
00:53:30.757 --> 00:53:33.060
Who would believe you?

816
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.490
In no time,

817
00:53:35.495 --> 00:53:38.260
there will be word that it's a child out of wedlock,,,

818
00:53:40.567 --> 00:53:42.030
Is this the agency?

819
00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:45.470
This time, I want someone who hasn't had any education,

820
00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:46.800
Be quick,

821
00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:49.170
- Yes, all right, - Ma'am,

822
00:53:49.376 --> 00:53:51.310
She looks like your daughter,

823
00:53:51.378 --> 00:53:53.080
At least her toes do,

824
00:53:53.847 --> 00:53:55.110
Do you want to die?

825
00:53:58.485 --> 00:54:00.050
When did you come here?

826
00:54:00.988 --> 00:54:02.120
I just arrived,

827
00:54:02.289 --> 00:54:03.420
What are you looking at?

828
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.660
It's a thesis, You won't understand,

829
00:54:05.859 --> 00:54:08.690
Do you know how good you look when you're studying?

830
00:54:09.029 --> 00:54:10.630
Maybe it's because I'm not good at studying,

831
00:54:10.631 --> 00:54:12.530
but I always thought smart people look so fancy,

832
00:54:12.566 --> 00:54:16.230
Really? Then I should spend all night studying,

833
00:54:16.903 --> 00:54:19.740
Don't, Are you done with the patients?

834
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.170
Yes, And I won' t be working night shifts from now on,

835
00:54:22.576 --> 00:54:23.740
Let's go,

836
00:54:30.217 --> 00:54:34.390
There aren't many patients here, You should go back to Cheongdam-dong,

837
00:54:34.655 --> 00:54:36.720
Mom wants you to come back too,

838
00:54:37.491 --> 00:54:38.820
I like it right now,

839
00:54:39.092 --> 00:54:41.790
I can spend more time with you after I finish work on time,

840
00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:43.430
When will you earn money?

841
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.590
Han Gyul's education fees will cost a lot,

842
00:54:45.599 --> 00:54:48.100
Why are you worried? Your mother has a lot of money,

843
00:54:48.168 --> 00:54:50.930
Gosh, that's the truth right there,

844
00:54:50.937 --> 00:54:52.370
You married me for money,

845
00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:55.170
It's not only money, There were many other reasons,

846
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:58.440
A hot girl from Cheongdam-dong,

847
00:55:00.247 --> 00:55:01.550
You're really smart indeed,

848
00:55:02.649 --> 00:55:03.950
Han Gyul must be waiting for us,

849
00:55:04.151 --> 00:55:05.380
- Let's go, - All right,

850
00:55:20.233 --> 00:55:22.370
- Mom! - Mom!

851
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:24.370
- Mom! - Han Gyul!

852
00:55:25.672 --> 00:55:27.410
Yeon Ju!

853
00:55:34.281 --> 00:55:36.050
You should call me "Mom",

854
00:55:40.587 --> 00:55:42.550
Bye, Do Yoon,

855
00:55:42.556 --> 00:55:44.820
Bye, Han Gyul, See you tomorrow,

856
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:49.960
Let's go,

857
00:55:52.632 --> 00:55:54.370
How was kindergarten today?

858
00:55:55.068 --> 00:55:58.200
I made a boyfriend, His name is Kim Do Yoon,

859
00:55:58.538 --> 00:56:00.140
He's really kind,

860
00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:04.840
Do you like it here?

861
00:56:05.879 --> 00:56:07.180
I really like it,

862
00:56:07.514 --> 00:56:11.310
It's better than the house that I lived in,,,

863
00:56:11.318 --> 00:56:13.250
a long time ago,

864
00:56:13.587 --> 00:56:17.390
But I like Grandpa's house better than Grandma's house,

865
00:56:17.758 --> 00:56:20.830
But this is much better than Grandpa's house,

866
00:56:25.198 --> 00:56:26.360
Han Gyul,

867
00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:31.400
Do you remember the house you used to live a long time ago?

868
00:56:34.341 --> 00:56:37.910
The house I lived with Aunt?

869
00:56:40.614 --> 00:56:43.880
Do you remember living with Aunt?

870
00:56:48.422 --> 00:56:52.220
If you ever leave the house again, I'll never come to see you again,

871
00:56:52.559 --> 00:56:54.090
Do you get it?

872
00:56:56.096 --> 00:56:57.360
Be quiet,

873
00:57:00.233 --> 00:57:02.470
Aunt Su Ji,

874
00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:07.910
Then who did you live with,,,

875
00:57:08.508 --> 00:57:10.340
before living with Aunt?

876
00:57:11.478 --> 00:57:14.050
Do you remember whom you lived with?

877
00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:19.650
Let's eat, Han Gyul,

878
00:57:19.886 --> 00:57:22.620
I cooked your favorite side dish,

879
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.760
I was so startled,

880
00:57:33.533 --> 00:57:36.160
I'm glad there weren't many people around,

881
00:57:36.169 --> 00:57:38.930
They almost found out I'm not her biological mother,

882
00:57:38.939 --> 00:57:41.500
I told you,

883
00:57:41.508 --> 00:57:45.640
You should've taught her before sending her to the kindergarten,

884
00:57:46.146 --> 00:57:47.740
I told her as I walked her to the kindergarten,

885
00:57:47.747 --> 00:57:50.150
To call me Mom instead of Yeon Ju,

886
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:55.050
She wouldn't get used to it overnight,

887
00:57:55.822 --> 00:57:58.450
So Won keeps saying it's better to tell other people,,,

888
00:57:58.458 --> 00:58:00.460
because it's obvious,

889
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.790
Be quiet,

890
00:58:02.462 --> 00:58:04.930
Are you out of your mind?

891
00:58:05.365 --> 00:58:07.060
What are you talking about?

892
00:58:07.067 --> 00:58:09.830
Women talk so much,

893
00:58:09.836 --> 00:58:12.730
They're seeking for,,,

894
00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:15.100
things to gossip,

895
00:58:15.108 --> 00:58:18.570
You can never do that, You'll get hurt,

896
00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:21.450
You can never do that, No,

897
00:58:26.052 --> 00:58:28.450
It's fine, Tell me,

898
00:58:29.689 --> 00:58:30.920
Do you remember?

899
00:58:32.158 --> 00:58:33.830
The person you lived with?

900
00:58:36.263 --> 00:58:37.700
Dad,

901
00:58:38.532 --> 00:58:41.700
She's my mom,

902
00:58:45.539 --> 00:58:48.740
Why would you ask her about that?

903
00:58:48.842 --> 00:58:52.440
Kids forget about what happened before six,

904
00:58:52.445 --> 00:58:54.210
Don't say anything to her,

905
00:58:54.381 --> 00:58:57.120
From now on, she is,,,

906
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:59.220
your only mom,

907
00:59:04.257 --> 00:59:05.390
Han Gyul,

908
00:59:05.759 --> 00:59:09.460
From now on, the mother who gave birth to you and raised you,,,

909
00:59:09.896 --> 00:59:13.200
is her, She's the only one, Do you understand?

910
00:59:14.134 --> 00:59:18.970
Yes, Yeon Ju is my mom,

911
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:21.840
No, Don't call her that,

912
00:59:21.841 --> 00:59:25.140
You should never say that outside,

913
00:59:25.478 --> 00:59:30.780
From now, she's your mother who gave birth to you and raised you,

914
00:59:31.017 --> 00:59:34.390
Let's try it now, Say Mom,

915
00:59:46.733 --> 00:59:48.160
Mom,

916
00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:50.130
Say it loud,

917
00:59:50.136 --> 00:59:53.300
Mom, Say Mom,

918
00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.740
Mom,

919
00:59:55.742 --> 00:59:57.310
Say it loud,

920
00:59:57.344 --> 00:59:59.710
Mom! Why can't you say it?

921
01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:04.550
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

922
01:00:04.551 --> 01:00:06.350
Don't say it like you're reading,

923
01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.420
Mom, Mom, Mom, Say Mom,

924
01:00:10.991 --> 01:00:14.690
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

925
01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:17.360
Mom, Mom, Mom,

926
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.600
- Mother, - Stay out of this,

927
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.130
Do it again,

928
01:00:22.268 --> 01:00:25.140
Mom, Say it like that,

929
01:00:25.171 --> 01:00:30.080
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

930
01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:32.570
Mom, Mom,

931
01:00:32.579 --> 01:00:33.910
- Mom, - Don't cry,

932
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.620
Stop it, Mom, She'll be better now,

933
01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.380
Be quiet,

934
01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:42.550
You should've been ready for this to raise someone else's kid,

935
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:45.660
Stop crying, Do it again,

936
01:00:46.493 --> 01:00:49.220
Mom, Mom, Mom,

937
01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:51.930
Say Mom, Do it,

938
01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:56.030
Mom, Mom, Mom,

939
01:00:56.336 --> 01:00:58.230
Mom,

940
01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:00.440
It's fine,

941
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.370
Stop crying, and do it again,

942
01:01:02.509 --> 01:01:05.680
- It's fine, Good job, - Mom,

943
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.610
You can stop now,

944
01:01:08.848 --> 01:01:10.220
You can stop,

945
01:01:34.507 --> 01:01:36.270
Is this really necessary?

946
01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:39.510
It's hard for me too, but Mom's right,

947
01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:44.120
I should be strict to be her only mom,

948
01:01:45.151 --> 01:01:49.120
That way, you, Han Gyul, and I won't be hurt,

949
01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:57.330
Han Gyul might remember her mother,

950
01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:00.900
Do you think you can delete that memory forcibly?

951
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.860
She only raised her until she turned 3 or 4,

952
01:02:02.869 --> 01:02:05.330
You can easily delete that memory,

953
01:02:05.338 --> 01:02:09.410
No, We must delete that memory clean for Han Gyul to be happy,

954
01:02:10.744 --> 01:02:12.510
She only gave her birth, She abandoned her,,,

955
01:02:12.512 --> 01:02:14.510
and even went to prison,

956
01:02:15.048 --> 01:02:17.110
It'll only hurt her if she remembers,

957
01:02:17.117 --> 01:02:18.620
What about people we know?

958
01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:21.950
No matter how desperate you try, you can't stop rumors from spreading,

959
01:02:22.288 --> 01:02:24.760
Everyone knows that we reunited after getting a divorce,

960
01:02:24.924 --> 01:02:26.760
People will find out one day,

961
01:02:27.861 --> 01:02:30.030
Aren't you worried about the pain you'll receive then?

962
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.530
What about the pain Han Gyul will go through?

963
01:02:32.532 --> 01:02:35.960
By then, Han Gyul will take me as her real mother,,,

964
01:02:35.969 --> 01:02:38.200
that she'll be hurt less than now,

965
01:02:38.905 --> 01:02:41.070
I want to delay it until then,

966
01:02:41.441 --> 01:02:45.340
The fact I didn't give birth to Han Gyul,

967
01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:52.980
I'll try harder,

968
01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.550
You need to help me,,,

969
01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.420
to be wise and cheer up,

970
01:03:01.327 --> 01:03:02.790
Please,

971
01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:18.740
Are you done crying, Han Gyul?

972
01:03:19.445 --> 01:03:20.640
Han Gyul's sleeping,

973
01:03:20.647 --> 01:03:24.350
How can you talk back if you're sleeping?

974
01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:28.050
I'm doing it for your own good,

975
01:03:28.988 --> 01:03:31.090
I'm tired, I'm going to sleep,

976
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.060
Okay, Sleep,

977
01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:35.530
My baby,

978
01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.030
Okay,

979
01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.230
People,,,

980
01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.140
don't live long,

981
01:03:45.538 --> 01:03:47.310
We live,,,

982
01:03:47.941 --> 01:03:51.910
in the chaotic world until we die,

983
01:03:53.146 --> 01:03:56.210
Dear, Dear,

984
01:03:56.516 --> 01:03:59.380
Sleep tight, my baby

985
01:03:59.819 --> 01:04:03.220
Sleep tight, my baby

986
01:04:03.823 --> 01:04:05.260
Sleep tight,

987
01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:22.240
Can I sleep next to you?

988
01:04:22.342 --> 01:04:24.180
Do you want to get kicked out to the living room?

989
01:04:27.247 --> 01:04:29.710
- Mom, - Yes,

990
01:04:29.716 --> 01:04:32.980
Why? We were about to go to bed,

991
01:04:34.587 --> 01:04:36.990
What's up, Eun Byul? Do you have something to say?

992
01:04:39.692 --> 01:04:41.290
You can stop it now,

993
01:04:41.728 --> 01:04:44.460
I can't stand watching your bad acting,

994
01:04:50.737 --> 01:04:54.910
They're right, I can't do it anymore,

995
01:04:55.241 --> 01:04:57.110
When are you going to stop it?

996
01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.970
I admit what I did was wrong,

997
01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:01.910
But I shouldn't be so criticized,

998
01:05:03.216 --> 01:05:05.150
Are you serious?

999
01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.380
I couldn't say it in front of kids,

1000
01:05:07.387 --> 01:05:10.590
but what you did is a calculated crime,

1001
01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:12.490
How many times do I need to tell you?

1002
01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:16.190
I wasn't myself at the time, I visited him due to anger,

1003
01:05:16.195 --> 01:05:18.130
Of course I didn't do anything and just left,

1004
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:21.560
Don't lie, Tae Yang told me everything,

1005
01:05:21.567 --> 01:05:23.670
You failed on the second time,

1006
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:26.970
Did you think I wouldn't know that you visited him long before that,,,

1007
01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:28.570
and pull off the respirator?

1008
01:05:28.741 --> 01:05:31.310
What? What are you talking about?

1009
01:05:31.778 --> 01:05:34.180
When did I pull off the respirator?

1010
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.280
I only went to the hospital,,,

1011
01:05:36.282 --> 01:05:39.050
but ran out after getting caught by Tae Yang,

1012
01:05:39.052 --> 01:05:40.750
I didn't do anything,

1013
01:05:40.987 --> 01:05:42.620
Is that true?

1014
01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:47.830
I'm asking you,

1015
01:05:47.994 --> 01:05:49.790
Is that true?

1016
01:05:49.896 --> 01:05:51.960
Is that the only time you went to the room?

1017
01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:54.230
When I caught you?

1018
01:05:54.233 --> 01:05:57.000
Yes, I don't know anything that happened before that,

1019
01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:00.670
I swear that was the first time,

1020
01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.440
That means it's someone else,

1021
01:06:06.279 --> 01:06:07.810
Someone,,,

1022
01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:10.480
tried to kill Father for real,

1023
01:06:13.586 --> 01:06:14.990
Who would that be?

1024
01:06:15.788 --> 01:06:17.990
Who would try to kill Chairman Kevin?

1025
01:06:19.258 --> 01:06:20.320
There's one,

1026
01:06:22.261 --> 01:06:23.590
One person,

1027
01:06:35.508 --> 01:06:38.510
- We'll always be in love, - We'll always love each other,

1028
01:06:38.511 --> 01:06:40.450
(They're reading the same thing,)

1029
01:06:41.547 --> 01:06:42.910
- The line, - Hey,

1030
01:06:43.483 --> 01:06:45.580
Say goodnight,

1031
01:06:46.052 --> 01:06:47.490
- Goodnight, - We should go too,

1032
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.520
- Wait, - We have to go,

1033
01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.020
Wait,

1034
01:06:51.858 --> 01:06:54.290
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1035
01:06:54.694 --> 01:06:57.460
Long time no see, You're wearing something so expensive,

1036
01:06:57.463 --> 01:06:58.730
It's strange,

1037
01:06:58.731 --> 01:07:01.160
Is he really on a date?

1038
01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:02.460
He even sprayed perfume,

1039
01:07:02.468 --> 01:07:04.470
The truth doesn't disappear by turning away,

1040
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:06.330
I'll find Ha Eun Jo,

1041
01:07:06.339 --> 01:07:08.840
Are you out of your mind? That'll ruin the company,

1042
01:07:08.841 --> 01:07:10.870
It's not the company that will be ruined,

1043
01:07:10.877 --> 01:07:12.670
Chairman Kevin will be ruined,

1044
01:07:12.678 --> 01:07:15.280
It's probably someone who can enter Chairman Kevin's room frequently,

1045
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.850
We have to find it out by all means,
