(A cold winter day where
everything is frozen)

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:19.125 line:93%
(But laughter is blossoming
in Ask Us Anything School)

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:21.750 line:93%
Don't we need to vote for
a new class president?

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:23.929 line:93%
Stop it, I told you I don't
want to be the president!

00:00:23.953 --> 00:00:26.420 line:93%
Why do you keep telling me to be one?

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.421 line:93%
(Hee-chul's confused)

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:33.210 line:93%
I just want to quietly support
you guys behind the scene.

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:35.585 line:93%
(How cheesy and embarrassing)

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.375 line:93%
Silently showing support, I don't
want to be in the limelight.

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.570 line:93%
You should stay quiet now then.

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:43.132 line:93%
That's what you said, right? "Silently"?

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.437 line:93%
He keeps pushing me to be front and center!

00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:47.859 line:93%
You gotta be like me,
staying quiet and still.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.609 line:93%
I have no desire to serve another term.

00:00:50.703 --> 00:00:54.906 line:93%
Whoever wants to run should
raise their hand and volunteer.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:57.523 line:93%
Close your eyes and raise your hand!
Don't open your eyes.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.421 line:93%
Kyung-hoon, that was so loud.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.195 line:93%
(Oh, you heard me?)

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.953 line:93%
(Hee-chul heard Kyung-hoon's
greed for success)

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.796 line:93%
So Kyung-hoon's a candidate then.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:11.859 line:93%
I'm running for it.

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:14.312 line:93%
I nominate Kim Yeong-cheol.

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:16.757 line:93%
(That's unexpected)

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.830 line:93%
They should volunteer.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.421 line:93%
I do want to be the class president.
I accept the nomination.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.093 line:93%
Kim Yeong-cheol and Min Kyung-hoon.

00:01:23.118 --> 00:01:25.617 line:93%
Let's vote by a show of hands.

00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:27.617 line:93%
If I become the class president!

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:29.765 line:93%
I'll do some remodeling in this room.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:32.040 line:93%
- Remodeling how?
- Are you sure?

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.671 line:93%
I'll come in the morning
and hang up some balloons.

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:38.867 line:93%
Hey, Jang-hoon bought all of us
tennis shoes when he won last year.

00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:42.945 line:93%
Our show had our highest
rating during my term.

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:45.390 line:93%
I have many accomplishments like that.

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:48.234 line:93%
(You just said you had no
intention of running again?)

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.726 line:93%
I do resign though, a clean break.

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:53.203 line:93%
No you can't!

00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:57.109 line:93%
- You're nominating Jang-hoon?
- Yeah, my brother in sports is great.

00:01:57.227 --> 00:01:59.304 line:93%
(He's secretly glad to be nominated)

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:01.265 line:93%
So then!

00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:03.523 line:93%
Kyung-hoon, Jang-hoon,
Yeong-cheol, go up front.

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:06.000 line:93%
Make your pledges but our
lunch menu might change if

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.054 line:93%
Jang-hoon's no longer the class president.

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:10.726 line:93%
(Candidates to announce their pledge)

00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:13.679 line:93%
(Looking like Olympic medalists)

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:15.492 line:93%
I'll keep it short, I won't talk for long.

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:20.179 line:93%
Our show did reach our highest
rating ever during my last term.

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:24.062 line:93%
And many other good things
happened during that time.

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:25.796 line:93%
These are my accomplishments.

00:02:25.828 --> 00:02:27.851 line:93%
We recognize that, but tell
us what you'll do if you win.

00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:29.726 line:93%
- A pledge?
- It's the new year, too.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.695 line:93%
I'll treat everyone with
delicious and sweet alcohol!

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:35.789 line:93%
(The magic word to bring
supporters to their feet)

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:39.406 line:93%
(Underage drinking and
smoking is prohibited)

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:42.515 line:93%
(Wake up, guys!)

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.703 line:93%
If I become the president...

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:50.023 line:93%
I'll host blind dates with the school
next door for the future of our school.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.210 line:93%
(Praise Min Kyung-hoon!)

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.164 line:93%
- It's the all-boy school?
- An all-girl school.

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.523 line:93%
Forget it then.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.367 line:93%
I'll host blind dates for us.

00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:59.960 line:93%
You believe him? He just
stays home all day.

00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:01.977 line:93%
He just wants to go on a date.

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:05.164 line:93%
(Candidate #3 Kim Yeong-cheol,
nominated by Sang-min)

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.718 line:93%
I'll promote our school via social media.

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:10.328 line:93%
I'll make sure we get cool
people to transfer here.

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:13.304 line:93%
Leave the party!

00:03:14.657 --> 00:03:17.781 line:93%
Let's vote then, you four can vote.

00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:20.062 line:93%
You guys should vote first.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.703 line:93%
I believe we need some younger
blood in this school.

00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:26.250 line:93%
So!

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:30.460 line:93%
I cast my vote for Min Kyung-hoon.

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:32.210 line:93%
Alright, Min!

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:36.499 line:93%
I agree with what Jang-hoon just said.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.828 line:93%
I'd like to give myself a chance.

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:42.117 line:93%
He's got 2 votes!

00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:46.546 line:93%
I'm a little nervous that
Sang-min's not gonna vote for me.

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:48.687 line:93%
(He may sway like a reed)

00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.023 line:93%
So I vote for myself too.

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.679 line:93%
First, Kim Hee-chul!

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:54.328 line:93%
It's by secret ballot?

00:03:54.352 --> 00:03:55.828 line:93%
No, it's an open ballot.

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.242 line:93%
(Open ballot with the candidates watching)

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:00.046 line:93%
We're watching you!

00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.781 line:93%
I like the idea of a new person, but
Kyung-hoon hasn't been so responsible

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:07.040 line:93%
up until now.

00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:08.760 line:93%
Ho-dong should vote last.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.281 line:93%
I'll treat you out for dinner today.

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:13.905 line:93%
Why, thank you!

00:04:14.847 --> 00:04:16.570 line:93%
(Sang-min nominated Yeong-cheol earlier)

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:19.921 line:93%
I think this person will work hard for
the class and the transfer students.

00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:21.453 line:93%
(Stays loyal to Yeong-cheol)

00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:23.083 line:93%
What if I really win?

00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:27.539 line:93%
Yeong-cheol! He's the
first one to get 2 votes?

00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:29.328 line:93%
(So excited)

00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:30.562 line:93%
Lee Soo-geun!

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.000 line:93%
He knows me very well, we
share the same waiting room.

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:35.914 line:93%
Yes, I know you.

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:38.906 line:93%
We shared the same waiting
room for 2 years.

00:04:38.922 --> 00:04:41.855 line:93%
But he's got no quality
to be the president.

00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:49.148 line:93%
Please finish it off for us.

00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:51.093 line:93%
You must feel so pressured.

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:52.748 line:93%
I do!

00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:58.093 line:93%
"Seo-portainment!"

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.281 line:93%
(Seo Jang-hoon + Sportainment)

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.953 line:93%
(Of course he supports
his brother in sports)

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:06.476 line:93%
This really means nothing.

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:08.976 line:93%
I wasn't gonna do it!

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:12.007 line:93%
(Choosing Jang-hoon without hesitance)

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.492 line:93%
(Seo Jang-hoon is voted
in for 2 years straight!)

00:05:17.076 --> 00:05:18.851 line:93%
Kyung-hoon's really sad!

00:05:18.938 --> 00:05:20.554 line:93%
Are you really disappointed?

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:23.710 line:93%
We cannot break this current system.

00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:27.695 line:93%
(Didn't know he wanted a revolution)

00:05:27.857 --> 00:05:29.507 line:93%
You really wanted it, right?

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.625 line:93%
(Congratulation, President Seo!)

00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:42.140 line:93%
Are you gonna get rid of people who
didn't vote for you, like Sang-min?

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:44.843 line:93%
(A huge price to pay)

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:47.984 line:93%
I love even those who didn't vote for me.

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:49.765 line:93%
I'll work hard with such a mindset.

00:05:49.852 --> 00:05:53.265 line:93%
I was honored to be on the
same ballot with you.

00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.398 line:93%
(The transfer students arrive!)

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:04.437 line:93%
(Sexy)

00:06:04.462 --> 00:06:06.679 line:93%
It's Jang Seo-hee!

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:08.601 line:93%
Hello, Hong Seok-cheon!

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:12.906 line:93%
Whom did he point?

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:14.843 line:93%
I dodged.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.890 line:93%
Hello, guys!

00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:19.468 line:93%
We've met before, long time ago.

00:06:19.477 --> 00:06:20.477 line:93%
Yeah, we have.

00:06:20.507 --> 00:06:22.265 line:93%
You made me cry so much!

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:24.679 line:93%
That's why you remember!

00:06:25.988 --> 00:06:27.046 line:93%
(You made Ho-dong cry!)

00:06:27.094 --> 00:06:28.890 line:93%
Let me introduce myself first.

00:06:28.945 --> 00:06:33.757 line:93%
I'm Jang Seo-hee from "Every Drama
I'm in Becomes a Big Hit" School.

00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:37.492 line:93%
(Nice to meet you!)

00:06:37.508 --> 00:06:39.187 line:93%
She made us cry recently too!

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.375 line:93%
Really? How?

00:06:40.437 --> 00:06:42.625 line:93%
You'll find out soon.

00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:44.295 line:93%
She lives and dies constantly.

00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:47.428 line:93%
Guys, I'm here too!
Ho-dong, I'm here!

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:50.195 line:93%
I'll introduce myself.

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:55.601 line:93%
I'm Hong Seok-cheon from "I love
You Brothers the Most" School.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.240 line:93%
It's nice to see you.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.781 line:93%
(Nice to see you!)

00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:02.328 line:93%
Would you like a build a very
special friendship with me?

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:04.210 line:93%
Kyung-hoon?

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:07.937 line:93%
A special friendship.

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:09.359 line:93%
Nothing dangerous.

00:07:09.406 --> 00:07:13.421 line:93%
Friendship is good! I'd like
to build friendship with you.

00:07:13.703 --> 00:07:15.000 line:93%
Let's do that all night.

00:07:15.031 --> 00:07:16.820 line:93%
It has to be all night?

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:18.828 line:93%
(Acting prudish)

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.187 line:93%
Seo-hee was on a TV drama, "Band
of Sisters," until recently.

00:07:22.203 --> 00:07:24.570 line:93%
It aired at our time slot!

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.851 line:93%
(She was a rival)

00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.624 line:93%
It had really high rating.

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:31.064 line:93%
It made it really hard for our show.

00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:34.710 line:93%
I've actually been watching
this show since Episode 1.

00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:37.195 line:93%
- I did hear that she's a huge fan.
- I am!

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.437 line:93%
But I couldn't watch this show while
I was doing "Band of Sisters."

00:07:40.883 --> 00:07:42.148 line:93%
We were rivals.

00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:45.531 line:93%
The writer of "Band of Sisters"
is a huge fan of this show too.

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:48.375 line:93%
She also wrote "Geum Sa-wol" too, right?

00:07:48.414 --> 00:07:50.281 line:93%
She also wrote "Temptation of Wife"!

00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:51.906 line:93%
(Surprised to hear it)

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.132 line:93%
She wrote many famous TV dramas.

00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:58.578 line:93%
She was so happy for me when I
told her I'm coming on this show.

00:07:58.633 --> 00:07:59.875 line:93%
She told me to do a good job.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.570 line:93%
Maybe she wants us in her dramas
after seeing our skits here.

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:03.617 line:93%
Oh, that's right!

00:08:03.641 --> 00:08:08.867 line:93%
You know how Yeong-cheol used to copy
me a lot? With a mole on his face?

00:08:09.007 --> 00:08:10.247 line:93%
"Min So-hee!" [Her famous line]

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:11.865 line:93%
She wanted to thank you.

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:13.953 line:93%
Kim Soon-ok the screenwriter?

00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:16.328 line:93%
(But that was so long ago)

00:08:16.424 --> 00:08:18.024 line:93%
She knows who I am?

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.171 line:93%
Of course she does!

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:22.578 line:93%
I had a hard time choosing between
"Band of Sisters" and this show,

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.335 line:93%
as a viewer.

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:26.234 line:93%
What did you end up watching?

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:32.007 line:93%
I watched "Band of Sisters" when
girl-groups came on this show.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.343 line:93%
(We didn't think about his preference)

00:08:36.368 --> 00:08:37.906 line:93%
That was a great statement.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.953 line:93%
There was nothing to see!

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:41.757 line:93%
But you'd watch this show
when boy-groups come on?

00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:45.328 line:93%
Yes, of course!
Especially when BTS came on!

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:49.523 line:93%
Ji-min was so cute, I
couldn't change the channel!

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:52.242 line:93%
I love you, BTS!

00:08:54.082 --> 00:08:56.215 line:93%
(He's clear about what his preferences)

00:08:56.265 --> 00:08:57.445 line:93%
That was fun to watch.

00:08:57.477 --> 00:09:01.953 line:93%
I heard you knew that "Ask Us Anything"
will be successful from the get-go?

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:06.523 line:93%
Yeah, I did. I've been watching
it since the very first episode.

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:08.671 line:93%
I knew this show will turn out really well.

00:09:08.703 --> 00:09:11.601 line:93%
I saw your desperation.

00:09:11.922 --> 00:09:13.273 line:93%
No, really!

00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:16.539 line:93%
No one can beat you if you're desperate.

00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:20.968 line:93%
That's when Ho-dong and Soo-geun made
a comeback after getting in trouble.

00:09:21.008 --> 00:09:23.421 line:93%
Don't put me in the
same category as him.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.289 line:93%
"How can I ever stand before
the public ever again?"

00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:29.406 line:93%
(Embarrassed about what he said before)

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:31.750 line:93%
(He's acting just like Ho-dong)

00:09:31.773 --> 00:09:35.523 line:93%
"I, Ho-dong, hereby announce
that I retire from being on TV!"

00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:37.882 line:93%
(Doesn't know what to do)

00:09:38.368 --> 00:09:40.734 line:93%
(He was just barely getting over it)

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:45.039 line:93%
Ho-dong had already being on TV again
by the time this show started.

00:09:45.055 --> 00:09:47.960 line:93%
This was Soo-geun's first
show making a comeback.

00:09:48.008 --> 00:09:50.734 line:93%
But Ho-dong was already on TV for a while.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.046 line:93%
But still!

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.906 line:93%
People had a huge interest in
Ho-dong's being on this show.

00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:58.195 line:93%
I was very interested too.

00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:00.250 line:93%
So you saw our desperation.

00:10:01.327 --> 00:10:03.750 line:93%
Sang-min had to pay off his debt.

00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:06.960 line:93%
Yeong-cheol needed to be funny.

00:10:06.992 --> 00:10:08.781 line:93%
I was popular when this show started.

00:10:08.812 --> 00:10:11.101 line:93%
No, you weren't funny.

00:10:11.172 --> 00:10:14.187 line:93%
I was never funny in my entire career?

00:10:14.778 --> 00:10:17.054 line:93%
You gotta work harder this year.

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.906 line:93%
I work hard every year.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.460 line:93%
Jang-hoon was still
getting over his pain of love.

00:10:21.484 --> 00:10:22.945 line:93%
He needed this show to be healed.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.531 line:93%
It's been a long time since then.

00:10:24.594 --> 00:10:26.194 line:93%
"The pain of love?"

00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:27.921 line:93%
I'm tagged by it forever.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.101 line:93%
I'm being called "not funny" forever too.

00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:32.664 line:93%
Seok-cheon, you knew
we'd be successful too?

00:10:32.695 --> 00:10:37.101 line:93%
I first thought it was a
little old-fashioned.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.101 line:93%
I thought this show was a sinking ship.

00:10:39.117 --> 00:10:42.765 line:93%
But it was a very wise move
to change stuff around.

00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:44.257 line:93%
Did the producer change?

00:10:44.304 --> 00:10:45.904 line:93%
No, he's the same one.

00:10:45.922 --> 00:10:47.164 line:93%
The same one?

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.988 line:93%
Ho-dong's thoughts changed.

00:10:49.842 --> 00:10:52.953 line:93%
(Controlling this ship like Jack Sparrow)

00:10:55.614 --> 00:10:58.421 line:93%
The show format in the
beginning was Ho-dong's idea?

00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:00.789 line:93%
His mentality changed,
and everything changed.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.420 line:93%
It was hard back then.

00:11:02.523 --> 00:11:03.992 line:93%
But is that story true?

00:11:04.008 --> 00:11:08.804 line:93%
I heard Seok-cheon joined Jang-hoon
in "20 Billion Dollars Club."

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.264 line:93%
(Seok-cheon's super rich too?)

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.789 line:93%
He's probably got 30 billion.

00:11:14.828 --> 00:11:17.570 line:93%
I heard he owns every other
building in Itaewon.

00:11:17.602 --> 00:11:19.460 line:93%
Every other building there!

00:11:19.516 --> 00:11:21.316 line:93%
That's definitely not true.

00:11:21.328 --> 00:11:23.968 line:93%
My restaurants are in almost
every other building,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.453 line:93%
but I'm just a tenant there.

00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:29.765 line:93%
And a place I was a tenant for a
long time raised the rent too much.

00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:33.125 line:93%
So I bought a building in an
alley that's not so popular.

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:35.210 line:93%
So I do own a building, but

00:11:35.273 --> 00:11:38.742 line:93%
it's not like a huge one at a
major street like Jang-hoon's.

00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:41.882 line:93%
His building's got a huge
LED sign and everything.

00:11:41.907 --> 00:11:43.804 line:93%
I'm sure the price of his
building skyrocketed.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.195 line:93%
How much is your per square foot?

00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:47.601 line:93%
We don't have to talk about that.

00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:51.859 line:93%
The way I see it, Jang-hoon's more
wealthy in terms of owning buildings.

00:11:51.898 --> 00:11:53.601 line:93%
He makes so much money!

00:11:54.031 --> 00:11:58.062 line:93%
Chef Hong makes a lot of money! You
know how many restaurants he owns?

00:11:58.497 --> 00:12:00.085 line:93%
Jang-hoon's building's valued more.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:03.390 line:93%
What do you think, Seo-hee?
Itaewon's crazy with Seok-cheon, right?

00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:05.375 line:93%
But I think this way,

00:12:05.398 --> 00:12:07.148 line:93%
Seok-cheon's a very good person.

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:09.531 line:93%
I think he's blessed because of that.

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:11.139 line:93%
Thanks.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.304 line:93%
But I'm just thankful, that's all.

00:12:14.938 --> 00:12:16.687 line:93%
(He didn't like that she touched him)

00:12:16.734 --> 00:12:18.718 line:93%
He's telling her not to touch him.

00:12:18.797 --> 00:12:20.835 line:93%
Let go of this too.

00:12:20.938 --> 00:12:25.164 line:93%
He's really kind to his family and friends.

00:12:25.281 --> 00:12:31.031 line:93%
Seok-cheon named all his brands
with the same first letter.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.867 line:93%
Every single one was a success.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.560 line:93%
What's the secret behind your success?

00:12:34.563 --> 00:12:36.539 line:93%
No, some restaurants failed.

00:12:36.593 --> 00:12:40.031 line:93%
When I open up 10, about 3 or 4 fail.

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:42.359 line:93%
But people just don't know that well.

00:12:42.383 --> 00:12:45.500 line:93%
Was there a huge failure?
What was the biggest failure?

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:49.351 line:93%
I started an Internet clothing
shopping mall before.

00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:51.625 line:93%
I gave it a very unusual name.

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:54.906 line:93%
I wanted to use a name
that no one else would.

00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:57.109 line:93%
"Gay-deuk Shopping Mall"?

00:12:57.477 --> 00:13:00.460 line:93%
Like "Huge Profit"! [pun]

00:13:01.626 --> 00:13:02.734 line:93%
That's a nice name!

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:04.750 line:93%
I'm gonna use it one day.

00:13:05.721 --> 00:13:08.398 line:93%
The little kids would come, "Gay-deuk!"

00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:10.234 line:93%
Thanks!

00:13:11.544 --> 00:13:13.000 line:93%
(It's definitely a creative name)

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.906 line:93%
Only you can come up with that.

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:20.390 line:93%
For men's clothing website,

00:13:20.469 --> 00:13:22.351 line:93%
"Ne2Nom." [Hey, you guy]

00:13:24.492 --> 00:13:27.367 line:93%
How do you think I named
my women's clothing site?

00:13:27.392 --> 00:13:28.906 line:93%
"Ne2..." [Slightly
derogatory term for women]

00:13:28.945 --> 00:13:32.117 line:93%
Bingo! That's what I used.

00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:33.741 line:93%
It sounds offensive.

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:37.976 line:93%
- Isn't it cute? It's unique.
- Cute only to you!

00:13:39.317 --> 00:13:40.687 line:93%
It's offensive for most.

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:43.531 line:93%
"Go get some clothes from Ne2!"

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.023 line:93%
(A real-life bickering between friends)

00:13:46.048 --> 00:13:48.937 line:93%
- They're no longer around?
- They're not.

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.234 line:93%
The location caught on fire,
and that was the end.

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:53.914 line:93%
Aren't you being too harsh to Seo-hee?

00:13:53.961 --> 00:13:55.085 line:93%
You're being too cold!

00:13:55.156 --> 00:13:58.578 line:93%
I'd still be cold to any woman
here, even if it were Kim Hee-sun.

00:13:59.827 --> 00:14:01.937 line:93%
I put up a wall.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.812 line:93%
What if Twice came? All 9 of them!

00:14:04.938 --> 00:14:08.203 line:93%
There's no need for 9 girls here.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.726 line:93%
(He's clear about his preference)

00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:11.531 line:93%
What if Wanna One comes?

00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:14.289 line:93%
(Wanna One is welcomed!)

00:14:15.782 --> 00:14:19.000 line:93%
(Only Seok-cheon can play this role)

00:14:22.068 --> 00:14:23.507 line:93%
I love this.

00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:27.812 line:93%
Everyone's talking about
Seok-cheon, but not about Seo-hee.

00:14:27.883 --> 00:14:30.648 line:93%
She just won the best actress award!

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.476 line:93%
She won grand prize twice before.

00:14:33.492 --> 00:14:34.757 line:93%
Twice? Three times?

00:14:34.797 --> 00:14:36.007 line:93%
Twice.

00:14:36.063 --> 00:14:38.726 line:93%
Did you mention Ho-dong when you
gave your speech this time?

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.429 line:93%
- Why would I?
- Why not?

00:14:40.454 --> 00:14:42.570 line:93%
(Very disappointed)

00:14:43.043 --> 00:14:44.953 line:93%
You gotta mention him no matter what!

00:14:44.992 --> 00:14:46.695 line:93%
I even cried before because of you!

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.828 line:93%
(Mentioning Ho-dong is a must!)

00:14:48.853 --> 00:14:50.453 line:93%
You didn't thank our show either?

00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:52.945 line:93%
Why do I have to mention him?

00:14:53.457 --> 00:14:55.156 line:93%
We were rivals!

00:14:55.211 --> 00:14:59.023 line:93%
Give us back all the laughter you
had while watching our show.

00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:02.250 line:93%
Screenwriter "Kim Soo-ro" will protest you.

00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:04.359 line:93%
Kim Soo-ro the comedian?

00:15:05.093 --> 00:15:08.804 line:93%
I'll make sure to mention you
next time I win an award.

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:10.828 line:93%
Yeah, for the grand prize!

00:15:10.945 --> 00:15:13.545 line:93%
She's so nice, she applauds and stuff.

00:15:14.406 --> 00:15:16.006 line:93%
She's so lady-like.

00:15:16.047 --> 00:15:19.843 line:93%
But her face totally changes
when she plays a villain!

00:15:19.977 --> 00:15:22.507 line:93%
What's your secret? How
do you switch so well?

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:25.140 line:93%
She's got a lot of anger, that's why.

00:15:25.172 --> 00:15:26.906 line:93%
That's true!

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:30.054 line:93%
I went through a lot of
hardship in the past.

00:15:30.224 --> 00:15:32.437 line:93%
I was desperate, too.

00:15:32.477 --> 00:15:34.343 line:93%
(So we prepared something!)

00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:37.257 line:93%
We prepared some of her most famous scenes.

00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:38.960 line:93%
Are we ready?

00:15:39.432 --> 00:15:41.601 line:93%
That was from "Miss Mermaid."

00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:44.859 line:93%
I played a screenwriter in the drama.

00:15:46.263 --> 00:15:50.789 line:93%
This when I finally met the person
who made my mother become blind.

00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:53.375 line:93%
I should be so angry that
my eyes would flip out.

00:15:53.414 --> 00:15:56.214 line:93%
So I had to put a lot of force on my eyes.

00:15:56.242 --> 00:15:58.007 line:93%
It's been a while, but...

00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:00.257 line:93%
How dare you throw it?

00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:04.195 line:93%
I wrote that script all night through
blood and sweat! How dare you throw it!

00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:06.953 line:93%
(Goosebumps)

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:10.031 line:93%
Did you hear her voice?

00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:13.304 line:93%
The class president should try it.

00:16:13.336 --> 00:16:15.703 line:93%
Jang-hoon's the best at
"You're gonna die" scenes.

00:16:15.728 --> 00:16:18.368 line:93%
You need to set a good example.
Show us how it's done.

00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:20.236 line:93%
(Gathering his emotions)

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:23.164 line:93%
(Actor mode is on)

00:16:26.922 --> 00:16:28.382 line:93%
How dare you throw it?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.101 line:93%
I wrote that script all night through
blood and sweat! How dare you throw it!

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.937 line:93%
That's good, keep going!

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.562 line:93%
(His line continues)

00:16:39.193 --> 00:16:41.515 line:93%
How about you kill me too?

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:44.539 line:93%
And kill your ex-wife...

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.107 line:93%
(Can't believe he said it himself)

00:16:49.439 --> 00:16:51.460 line:93%
Why would you kill your ex-wife?

00:16:51.819 --> 00:16:53.718 line:93%
(Just drinks cold water)

00:16:53.758 --> 00:16:55.812 line:93%
Where was this line from?

00:16:55.991 --> 00:16:59.109 line:93%
I didn't read the next line ahead.

00:17:03.894 --> 00:17:06.094 line:93%
(The problematic line was hidden)

00:17:06.133 --> 00:17:07.733 line:93%
It was hidden!

00:17:07.773 --> 00:17:10.406 line:93%
(Not the right person for the part)

00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:14.718 line:93%
But you're a good actor!
You have a talent.

00:17:14.758 --> 00:17:16.358 line:93%
I'm good at being angry.

00:17:16.422 --> 00:17:18.022 line:93%
I'm really good at that.

00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:20.171 line:93%
It's just my life.

00:17:20.203 --> 00:17:22.335 line:93%
Seok-cheon, you did lots of acting too.

00:17:23.622 --> 00:17:28.617 line:93%
I went to Africa once to
shoot "Swallow the Sun."

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.867 line:93%
And there was a scene I'm supposed
to filmed with a cheetah.

00:17:32.883 --> 00:17:34.312 line:93%
It was trained.

00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:38.046 line:93%
But I guess the cheetah got annoyed
from being under the sun for too long.

00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:39.890 line:93%
And it bit me!

00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:41.515 line:93%
A cheetah bit you?

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.765 line:93%
If it were a wild cheetah, it
would've bit me in the next and

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.390 line:93%
I would've died.

00:17:46.406 --> 00:17:48.593 line:93%
But this one never bit a person before.

00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:50.843 line:93%
It bit me in the back, and I survived.

00:17:50.875 --> 00:17:55.187 line:93%
And after the initial medical treatment
was given, I said this to the director.

00:17:55.219 --> 00:17:57.812 line:93%
"We gotta shoot this scene again."

00:17:57.844 --> 00:17:59.531 line:93%
That's what I told him.

00:17:59.594 --> 00:18:02.671 line:93%
He was really thankful that I was willing.

00:18:02.703 --> 00:18:07.765 line:93%
So he promised that I can appear in his
TV dramas for the rest of my life.

00:18:07.918 --> 00:18:11.765 line:93%
It's because you weren't
bitten all the way.

00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:16.867 line:93%
He's destroying the mood!

00:18:17.382 --> 00:18:19.210 line:93%
What a new character!

00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:21.578 line:93%
I'm saying it could've
been even more dangerous!

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.765 line:93%
(He's taken aback)

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:27.483 line:93%
I'm really glad you're fine.

00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:29.468 line:93%
(Whatever)

00:18:29.493 --> 00:18:33.328 line:93%
Have you ever been bitten by a cheetah?

00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:35.765 line:93%
You don't know what you're talking about!

00:18:35.836 --> 00:18:37.569 line:93%
Why are you yelling at me?

00:18:39.783 --> 00:18:42.398 line:93%
(Kyung-hoon, you!)

00:18:43.367 --> 00:18:44.882 line:93%
That was a country accent.

00:18:44.922 --> 00:18:46.765 line:93%
I loved it.

00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:50.562 line:93%
(He's feeling better after just a touch)

00:18:52.008 --> 00:18:55.039 line:93%
(Kyung-hoon controls Seok-cheon's mood)

00:18:55.557 --> 00:18:57.515 line:93%
Kyung-hoon's got a good sense these days.

00:18:57.857 --> 00:19:02.867 line:93%
I think things will turn out
really well for him this year.

00:19:02.992 --> 00:19:05.656 line:93%
No, I heard that in 2016 too.

00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:06.867 line:93%
No, really.

00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:08.875 line:93%
I can't look into Seo-hee's future.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.617 line:93%
But I can see your future clearly.

00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:18.140 line:93%
There's light in your eyes, you'll
receive an award this year.

00:19:18.688 --> 00:19:23.687 line:93%
(Kyung-hoon will have a successful
year and receive awards next year)

00:19:23.712 --> 00:19:26.245 line:93%
But he doesn't like leaving the house.

00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:27.710 line:93%
This is the only show he does.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:32.835 line:93%
If he never wants to leave the house,
it means someone comes over to his.

00:19:33.716 --> 00:19:34.828 line:93%
That makes sense!

00:19:34.859 --> 00:19:37.398 line:93%
The yogurt lady delivers
yogurt, that's all.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.203 line:93%
(No one suspected who'd visit him at home)

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.015 line:93%
He's telling us the future!

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.070 line:93%
(He's gonna be great!)

00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:47.725 line:93%
Oh, someone else comes to
change my water filter.

00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:50.382 line:93%
He lives with his parents at home.

00:19:50.726 --> 00:19:53.140 line:93%
He loves his yogurt though.

00:19:53.524 --> 00:19:55.500 line:93%
(True love fermented over long time)

00:19:55.525 --> 00:19:57.828 line:93%
That's why you always talk about poop!

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.117 line:93%
Yeah, I go a lot because of it.

00:20:00.203 --> 00:20:02.242 line:93%
Give us what you filled out.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:05.093 line:93%
(Time to go over their application)

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.420 line:93%
Forget it!

00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:11.296 line:93%
Why?

00:20:11.367 --> 00:20:14.078 line:93%
You think this will settle things?

00:20:14.103 --> 00:20:15.921 line:93%
Leave here at once, I don't like you two.

00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:17.296 line:93%
Leave!

00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:20.578 line:93%
Who are you supposed to be?

00:20:21.996 --> 00:20:24.070 line:93%
What's up with this vibe?

00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:26.164 line:93%
(Picks up after himself)

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.156 line:93%
- Sorry.
- When'd you put on the mole?

00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:30.585 line:93%
I'm good at doing that
without getting caught.

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:33.023 line:93%
Be quiet, it's not time for you to talk.

00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:35.968 line:93%
I hate you!

00:20:36.086 --> 00:20:37.686 line:93%
You try doing this.

00:20:39.095 --> 00:20:40.882 line:93%
Let's take a look at their application.

00:20:40.898 --> 00:20:42.875 line:93%
Name: Jang Seo-hee.

00:20:42.984 --> 00:20:44.584 line:93%
Seo's your last name?

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:47.515 line:93%
What do you mean? My last name is Jang.

00:20:47.586 --> 00:20:49.890 line:93%
(How did he miss that?)

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.710 line:93%
You must be doing too many shows.

00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:54.203 line:93%
- How many is he doing?
- Too many!

00:20:54.228 --> 00:20:55.968 line:93%
He must've gotten confused
with Seo Jang-hoon.

00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:58.226 line:93%
Her nickname is "a girl."

00:20:59.696 --> 00:21:00.515 line:93%
Why's that?

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:03.437 line:93%
Guess why that is, why's
my nickname "a girl"?

00:21:04.142 --> 00:21:06.075 line:93%
It stands for "a scary girl"?

00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:09.704 line:93%
She's good at playing a villain.

00:21:10.634 --> 00:21:13.234 line:93%
It's not the answer, but that's clever!

00:21:14.004 --> 00:21:16.718 line:93%
A girl who loves beef!

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:17.695 line:93%
It's actually because...

00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:20.304 line:93%
A girl who picked pockets before.

00:21:20.329 --> 00:21:22.007 line:93%
Don't tell us, we'll guess.

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.898 line:93%
OK, try it.

00:21:24.703 --> 00:21:27.671 line:93%
You already gave a similar answer.

00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:30.546 line:93%
A girl who's played around before.

00:21:30.571 --> 00:21:32.601 line:93%
(Can't believe it)

00:21:32.926 --> 00:21:34.632 line:93%
Any acronym you can think of!

00:21:34.664 --> 00:21:36.210 line:93%
A girl who looks like a cow?

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:39.226 line:93%
A girl who works like an ox.

00:21:40.293 --> 00:21:42.500 line:93%
Yes, that's right.

00:21:42.808 --> 00:21:44.765 line:93%
It's because

00:21:44.797 --> 00:21:48.914 line:93%
when I was shooting a drama
with Ahn Seon-young,

00:21:48.938 --> 00:21:52.711 line:93%
she'd say, "You're really a girl."

00:21:52.736 --> 00:21:56.343 line:93%
I thought she meant something good,
like I come off young or something.

00:21:56.352 --> 00:21:58.890 line:93%
But she said, "No, you work like an ox!"

00:21:58.938 --> 00:22:02.484 line:93%
She said I just work all the time, I
should spend time dating or something.

00:22:02.516 --> 00:22:05.664 line:93%
You should fall in love, not
just work all the time.

00:22:05.734 --> 00:22:07.334 line:93%
(She had no scandal)

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:09.937 line:93%
I'm sure many guys asked her out before!

00:22:09.992 --> 00:22:11.328 line:93%
No, no.

00:22:11.353 --> 00:22:12.570 line:93%
It's not that case.

00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:15.000 line:93%
What kind of a guy do you like?

00:22:15.025 --> 00:22:16.125 line:93%
Be honest.

00:22:16.148 --> 00:22:19.335 line:93%
Pick a type. You gotta hurry, so
Seok-cheon can answer this too.

00:22:19.974 --> 00:22:21.375 line:93%
You're gonna ask me that too?

00:22:21.414 --> 00:22:23.214 line:93%
You can look forward to it!

00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:24.984 line:93%
For me, honestly?

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:27.382 line:93%
- Pick just one person here.
- Just one?

00:22:27.407 --> 00:22:29.007 line:93%
I'd say Kyung-hoon.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.484 line:93%
- Seok-cheon picked him too!
- They're rivals today.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.570 line:93%
I won't forgive you!

00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:36.411 line:93%
I won't let you have him!

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.735 line:93%
Who's your choice then?

00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:40.304 line:93%
(Thinking about it so seriously)

00:22:40.328 --> 00:22:43.484 line:93%
I used to like Hee-chul long ago.

00:22:43.516 --> 00:22:45.578 line:93%
But I like Kyung-hoon these days.

00:22:45.586 --> 00:22:47.171 line:93%
Both picked Kyung-hoon!

00:22:47.308 --> 00:22:50.140 line:93%
You two should make your case to compete.

00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:53.625 line:93%
(An unexpected love triangle)

00:22:54.992 --> 00:22:59.201 line:93%
A typical love triangle would
be to attain Seo-hee's love.

00:22:59.313 --> 00:23:01.656 line:93%
But these two are fighting over you!

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.359 line:93%
Tell me your reasons.

00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:07.281 line:93%
His sense of humor started to show more.

00:23:07.664 --> 00:23:09.617 line:93%
He's so witty and funny!

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.828 line:93%
It'll be great to have a
boyfriend who's so funny.

00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:15.500 line:93%
I hope you'd come out of your roles
and fall in love in real life.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.148 line:93%
You should speak for yourself.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.132 line:93%
You should worry about yourself first!

00:23:19.188 --> 00:23:21.953 line:93%
Don't go to New York and
try to get foreign girls.

00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:23.781 line:93%
What, really?

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.887 line:93%
Yeah, I caught him in New York!

00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:28.414 line:93%
(What was that, Yeong-cheol?)

00:23:28.944 --> 00:23:30.906 line:93%
(We've never seen him
taken aback like this)

00:23:31.217 --> 00:23:32.867 line:93%
(The crowd goes wild at this shocking news)

00:23:32.892 --> 00:23:35.726 line:93%
Yeong-cheol's alive and kicking!

00:23:37.713 --> 00:23:40.757 line:93%
This is why you don't like Korean girls?

00:23:42.331 --> 00:23:45.226 line:93%
That's why you learned English, right?

00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:49.648 line:93%
He kept going to America just for
3-day trips over the holidays.

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:51.632 line:93%
He went to England too!

00:23:53.942 --> 00:23:55.226 line:93%
How'd you do it?

00:23:55.266 --> 00:23:57.921 line:93%
There were beautiful women in front
of a night club in New York.

00:23:57.968 --> 00:24:01.078 line:93%
He was talking to them
in English like this.

00:24:01.605 --> 00:24:03.538 line:93%
He told them he's a comedian.

00:24:03.586 --> 00:24:04.906 line:93%
He was really popular among girls there.

00:24:04.938 --> 00:24:07.101 line:93%
Don't say that you're a comedian!

00:24:07.227 --> 00:24:09.546 line:93%
They might think every
Korean comedian is like you.

00:24:09.571 --> 00:24:11.328 line:93%
He looks funny to begin with.

00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:18.093 line:93%
Foreigners like this.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.983 line:93%
That's right! Foreigners really like him.

00:24:21.016 --> 00:24:23.945 line:93%
Seok-cheon said that his strength is...

00:24:23.992 --> 00:24:26.468 line:93%
"Seon-mi's dance."

00:24:26.772 --> 00:24:30.882 line:93%
But we had so many guests
who did that dance here.

00:24:30.961 --> 00:24:34.453 line:93%
Even actresses did that
dance here, models, too.

00:24:35.238 --> 00:24:36.562 line:93%
Many people did it already.

00:24:36.586 --> 00:24:38.826 line:93%
Seon-mi herself came on the
show and did that dance, too.

00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:40.078 line:93%
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:41.733 line:93%
So don't do it?

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.257 line:93%
- Kyung-hoon, you wanna see it?
- Yeah.

00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:48.390 line:93%
But I need some help.

00:24:48.438 --> 00:24:50.765 line:93%
I need a pole.

00:24:50.797 --> 00:24:53.476 line:93%
I need to poles.

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.890 line:93%
Can Kyung-hoon and Jang-hoon
become poles?

00:24:57.105 --> 00:25:01.312 line:93%
I'm so curious to see,
it's gonna be different.

00:25:04.986 --> 00:25:09.554 line:93%
("Gashina" by "Hong Seon-mi")

00:25:14.853 --> 00:25:16.765 line:93%
(He put on a wig to look sexy)

00:25:17.962 --> 00:25:19.453 line:93%
You're too tall!

00:25:21.458 --> 00:25:23.515 line:93%
(Being used for a pole dance)

00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:25.648 line:93%
(Sexy)

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.875 line:93%
(Hip movement)

00:25:30.876 --> 00:25:32.804 line:93%
I'm staring straight at his butt!

00:25:33.001 --> 00:25:35.148 line:93%
(So into it)

00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:38.625 line:93%
(The poles are embarrassed for him)

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.960 line:93%
(Sharp)

00:25:45.416 --> 00:25:47.359 line:93%
(The poles are late a beat)

00:25:47.469 --> 00:25:49.328 line:93%
(And he gives up)

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.414 line:93%
(Stealing the hearts of men)

00:25:52.705 --> 00:25:54.305 line:93%
(Sexy moves)

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.914 line:93%
(Showing off how flexible he is)

00:26:05.515 --> 00:26:08.171 line:93%
(How embarrassing!)

00:26:08.961 --> 00:26:11.867 line:93%
You should've caught me!

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.078 line:93%
I didn't know that was gonna happen!

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.570 line:93%
I didn't know I was supposed to!

00:26:15.688 --> 00:26:17.828 line:93%
(Everyone blames Jang-hoon)

00:26:18.591 --> 00:26:21.062 line:93%
(I shouldn't have trusted the pole)

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.289 line:93%
(Not a very well-made pillar)

00:26:24.564 --> 00:26:27.015 line:93%
That was "Hong Seon-mi!"

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.195 line:93%
Welcome to our school!

00:26:32.933 --> 00:26:35.445 line:93%
Let's try to guess things about Seo-hee.

00:26:35.578 --> 00:26:37.000 line:93%
Hope you get them right!

00:26:37.031 --> 00:26:41.796 line:93%
I did an interview after I finished
shooting "Temptation of Wife."

00:26:41.828 --> 00:26:44.437 line:93%
But I regretted doing it.

00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:48.382 line:93%
Many people said that I misspoke
because of that interview.

00:26:48.406 --> 00:26:50.073 line:93%
What do you think I said?

00:26:50.203 --> 00:26:53.234 line:93%
You declared that you'll quit smoking.
And you couldn't keep the promise.

00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:55.554 line:93%
(Baffled)

00:26:56.458 --> 00:26:58.058 line:93%
I better take this out.

00:26:58.195 --> 00:26:59.976 line:93%
It's just how we start things.

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:02.429 line:93%
She must've said something
she didn't have to.

00:27:03.734 --> 00:27:07.156 line:93%
You said, "I'll just marry my work!"

00:27:07.595 --> 00:27:09.953 line:93%
That was so not funny.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.600 line:93%
So cliche!

00:27:11.731 --> 00:27:15.234 line:93%
You really need to work on getting better.

00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:17.523 line:93%
You need to stop being on too many shows.

00:27:17.935 --> 00:27:19.679 line:93%
(Speechless at her blunt remark)

00:27:19.941 --> 00:27:23.515 line:93%
You were asked about your future plans.

00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:26.429 line:93%
And you said you want to start dating.

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:28.804 line:93%
You said it, but it never happened.

00:27:28.883 --> 00:27:29.984 line:93%
It's close.

00:27:30.016 --> 00:27:31.617 line:93%
But that's wrong.

00:27:31.656 --> 00:27:33.256 line:93%
I always get close.

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:36.593 line:93%
"I'll never get married."

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.000 line:93%
Isn't that your story?

00:27:39.211 --> 00:27:40.929 line:93%
(Me?)

00:27:41.603 --> 00:27:42.968 line:93%
(It's not about you!)

00:27:42.992 --> 00:27:46.492 line:93%
You were asked what your
goal is for a new year.

00:27:46.517 --> 00:27:49.281 line:93%
You said your goal was to
get married that year.

00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:51.882 line:93%
Not it.

00:27:52.125 --> 00:27:54.651 line:93%
You're the one who should get married.

00:27:54.676 --> 00:27:56.276 line:93%
(Trying to stay calm)

00:27:57.035 --> 00:27:58.281 line:93%
No need to keep trying.

00:27:58.306 --> 00:28:00.368 line:93%
You said you won't date someone.

00:28:00.393 --> 00:28:04.117 line:93%
Because you don't wanna meet a guy
like a character in the drama.

00:28:04.155 --> 00:28:06.625 line:93%
Because of what I said in the interview,

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.513 line:93%
something disappeared, like flew out.

00:28:08.538 --> 00:28:10.367 line:93%
Must be an ad offer.

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:11.812 line:93%
- Must be.
- That's not it.

00:28:11.852 --> 00:28:15.273 line:93%
It probably wasn't a dove flying
out of your pocket, right?

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:19.789 line:93%
The reporter asked you a question,

00:28:19.852 --> 00:28:22.695 line:93%
and you were offended and cussed him out.

00:28:22.928 --> 00:28:24.528 line:93%
(Me?)

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.417 line:93%
The reporter then punched
you, and your teeth flew out.

00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:30.398 line:93%
I'm not like you!

00:28:30.429 --> 00:28:32.500 line:93%
I love it when Kyung-hoon does this!

00:28:32.523 --> 00:28:34.523 line:93%
He's gonna be great this year!

00:28:35.711 --> 00:28:38.978 line:93%
Something flew out? Your
chance for a blind date?

00:28:39.999 --> 00:28:41.664 line:93%
(Must be close!)

00:28:41.742 --> 00:28:46.867 line:93%
You said, "I don't think I can
date someone for a while."

00:28:46.977 --> 00:28:50.500 line:93%
But you were supposed
to go on a blind date.

00:28:50.547 --> 00:28:54.632 line:93%
And the guy saw that interview and
canceled meeting up with you.

00:28:55.227 --> 00:28:56.827 line:93%
Walk on a flowery road!

00:28:58.119 --> 00:28:59.921 line:93%
(A flowery road ceremony)

00:29:00.277 --> 00:29:02.242 line:93%
It's really close, but not quite.

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:03.429 line:93%
Take back the ceremony!

00:29:03.453 --> 00:29:05.101 line:93%
Don't just walk out like that!

00:29:05.361 --> 00:29:07.085 line:93%
Pick'em up!

00:29:08.765 --> 00:29:10.968 line:93%
You're very close, it's similar.

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:13.546 line:93%
That drama had a very complex plot.

00:29:13.593 --> 00:29:17.468 line:93%
You said you didn't want a
relationship that's so complicated.

00:29:17.539 --> 00:29:18.851 line:93%
Cut it!

00:29:18.867 --> 00:29:21.554 line:93%
That should be edited out, so not funny.

00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:24.812 line:93%
This has never happened before!

00:29:24.837 --> 00:29:26.718 line:93%
No one ordered Ho-dong's
remark to be cut out.

00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:28.882 line:93%
It was not funny at all,
it should be edited out.

00:29:28.906 --> 00:29:30.840 line:93%
I'm not saying anything more.

00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:33.367 line:93%
You're really not gonna talk?

00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:36.000 line:93%
(She said "cut it"!)

00:29:39.094 --> 00:29:42.929 line:93%
"I don't want to meet someone
through a blind date."

00:29:42.977 --> 00:29:44.577 line:93%
Why not?

00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:46.132 line:93%
"I believe in fate."

00:29:46.156 --> 00:29:48.489 line:93%
"I want to fall in love like fate."

00:29:48.593 --> 00:29:49.187 line:93%
Fate!

00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:52.468 line:93%
Ho-dong's comments are so old-fashioned.

00:29:54.065 --> 00:29:56.226 line:93%
You think you're so fresh and young?

00:29:56.497 --> 00:29:58.562 line:93%
(Feels bad after saying it)

00:29:58.587 --> 00:29:59.554 line:93%
So fresh?

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.351 line:93%
Ho-dong is a little old school.

00:30:01.398 --> 00:30:03.781 line:93%
I got it, you had planned
to go on a blind date.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.710 line:93%
And you revealed your real age
in the interview by mistake.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.976 line:93%
"I was actually born in 1927."

00:30:09.078 --> 00:30:09.875 line:93%
What?

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.851 line:93%
(Anger rising)

00:30:12.304 --> 00:30:15.218 line:93%
How old is that supposed to be?

00:30:15.258 --> 00:30:17.960 line:93%
- Is that 100 years old?
- You should quit one of the shows.

00:30:18.094 --> 00:30:20.179 line:93%
(Sorry, that was too much)

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.796 line:93%
I'll give you a big hint.

00:30:22.836 --> 00:30:24.436 line:93%
It's about a number.

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:26.703 line:93%
(The giant wants to answer)

00:30:27.336 --> 00:30:31.750 line:93%
"I have 3 or 4 blind dates set up already."

00:30:31.938 --> 00:30:35.601 line:93%
And the guy thought he was the only one.

00:30:35.626 --> 00:30:38.085 line:93%
So the guy got mad and he canceled.

00:30:38.156 --> 00:30:39.875 line:93%
It's close!

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.781 line:93%
2 blind dates!

00:30:41.844 --> 00:30:43.444 line:93%
(The crowd goes crazy)

00:30:45.539 --> 00:30:47.578 line:93%
Hee-chul got it right.

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:52.000 line:93%
("Gashina" ceremony)

00:30:52.082 --> 00:30:53.914 line:93%
(Joy vs. Sadness)

00:30:54.536 --> 00:30:56.136 line:93%
(Rubbing it in his face)

00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:01.011 line:93%
(Automatic response)

00:31:03.476 --> 00:31:09.664 line:93%
When did we start to impose
such a detail to our answers?

00:31:09.931 --> 00:31:11.750 line:93%
You gotta be accurate!

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.734 line:93%
You gotta use the accurate word!

00:31:15.781 --> 00:31:17.101 line:93%
This is so hard.

00:31:17.148 --> 00:31:19.015 line:93%
(When you said it yourself!)

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:21.539 line:93%
(Correct answer if I said it,
but wrong if someone else did)

00:31:21.564 --> 00:31:24.359 line:93%
How many is very important.

00:31:25.242 --> 00:31:27.734 line:93%
None of them knew the
answer before I said it.

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:29.359 line:93%
I was the only one!

00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:32.718 line:93%
You shouldn't have answered it that fast.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.835 line:93%
You're like an ox in the Chinese
zodiac sign story, and I'm the rat.

00:31:35.922 --> 00:31:39.296 line:93%
The rat was sitting on top of an ox,
then jumped off at the finish line.

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:42.109 line:93%
- Then I won!
- How clever!

00:31:42.711 --> 00:31:46.875 line:93%
I was asked about my plans
after the drama ended.

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.585 line:93%
I said, "I have 2 blind dates lined up!"

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.445 line:93%
I wanted to show off.

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:52.835 line:93%
But the guys I was supposed to
go on dates with were upset.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.265 line:93%
They had every reason to, they didn't
know I was going on 2 separate dates.

00:31:57.313 --> 00:31:58.679 line:93%
So the dates never happened.

00:31:58.711 --> 00:32:00.671 line:93%
- For both?
- Yeah.

00:32:03.242 --> 00:32:05.742 line:93%
That's why people around
me said I had a big mouth.

00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:09.078 line:93%
It's better not to have met
someone who gets upset at that.

00:32:09.133 --> 00:32:12.500 line:93%
They should've thought to work harder to
win you over, even if you had 10 dates.

00:32:12.578 --> 00:32:14.843 line:93%
Why are you so pessimistic?

00:32:14.868 --> 00:32:17.703 line:93%
We're on your side! You should
stop being on too many shows.

00:32:18.394 --> 00:32:20.304 line:93%
Can't you see we're on your side?

00:32:20.336 --> 00:32:22.403 line:93%
Do you go on blind dates often?

00:32:22.445 --> 00:32:24.429 line:93%
No, not often.

00:32:24.477 --> 00:32:28.179 line:93%
But it's the only way I can
meet people with regular jobs.

00:32:28.257 --> 00:32:31.242 line:93%
How about dating someone in
the entertainment industry?

00:32:31.266 --> 00:32:33.399 line:93%
I don't find that so attractive.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.953 line:93%
You can understand each other better.

00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:38.796 line:93%
I think it's harder to understand,
because you know so well.

00:32:39.705 --> 00:32:41.305 line:93%
That's possible.

00:32:41.572 --> 00:32:43.853 line:93%
You were never asked out by a celebrity?

00:32:43.908 --> 00:32:44.837 line:93%
I was.

00:32:44.853 --> 00:32:45.853 line:93%
I'm sure!

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.306 line:93%
- Who was it?
- Tell us the name.

00:32:49.322 --> 00:32:51.118 line:93%
I can't tell you the name!

00:32:51.209 --> 00:32:53.236 line:93%
We won't air it on TV.

00:32:53.384 --> 00:32:55.282 line:93%
Just tell us here! We won't show it.

00:32:55.369 --> 00:32:58.376 line:93%
- You can tell us the name.
- No I can't!

00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:01.431 line:93%
Then say you were never
asked out by a celebrity.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.368 line:93%
Were you ever asked out by a celebrity?

00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:05.016 line:93%
What is this?

00:33:06.012 --> 00:33:07.025 line:93%
Tell us the name!

00:33:07.056 --> 00:33:08.868 line:93%
No!

00:33:08.893 --> 00:33:11.345 line:93%
Don't worry, I told
everyone I'm married too!

00:33:11.815 --> 00:33:13.175 line:93%
Yeah, tell us how
things are going.

00:33:13.182 --> 00:33:16.220 line:93%
Jang-hoon even talked
about how he's divorced!

00:33:16.575 --> 00:33:17.939 line:93%
Older? Or younger?

00:33:18.009 --> 00:33:20.118 line:93%
Guys, you think I'm a dummy?

00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:21.564 line:93%
Younger?

00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:24.728 line:93%
Younger and older, yes.

00:33:25.824 --> 00:33:28.337 line:93%
Is he married now? Or is he divorced?

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.196 line:93%
He got married.

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:31.790 line:93%
The younger one too?

00:33:31.853 --> 00:33:33.665 line:93%
- No, he didn't.
- Give us his name!

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.736 line:93%
Oh no, I'm being convinced! I can't.

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:39.025 line:93%
(They're not letting it go)

00:33:39.307 --> 00:33:41.196 line:93%
Wait, I have something to ask you.

00:33:41.221 --> 00:33:43.946 line:93%
No, we're more curious about our question.
Give us his initials!

00:33:43.978 --> 00:33:49.415 line:93%
When you go on blind dates, when
do you find the girl unattractive?

00:33:51.826 --> 00:33:53.736 line:93%
"What's that?"

00:33:54.095 --> 00:33:56.103 line:93%
This happened to me before.

00:33:56.494 --> 00:34:00.657 line:93%
We were supposed to meet at 6 pm, and
I texted her to confirm around 4:30.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.571 line:93%
"You know about 6 o'clock?
You're on your way?"

00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:06.376 line:93%
"Sorry, I don't think I can go today."

00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:08.478 line:93%
(Oh my...)

00:34:08.769 --> 00:34:11.993 line:93%
I was so hurt, she hurt my pride.

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:14.118 line:93%
On the day of, just an
hour and a half before!

00:34:14.142 --> 00:34:15.931 line:93%
I can see why you left for New York.

00:34:16.025 --> 00:34:18.243 line:93%
It's one thing if she texted me first.

00:34:18.268 --> 00:34:21.267 line:93%
"Sorry, I got the flu," or something!

00:34:21.353 --> 00:34:24.986 line:93%
But I asked to confirm, and she told me no.

00:34:25.322 --> 00:34:28.790 line:93%
I ordered a hamburger
over the phone recently.

00:34:28.831 --> 00:34:30.540 line:93%
I was in a hurry.

00:34:30.602 --> 00:34:33.486 line:93%
- Which brand?
- "M."

00:34:33.511 --> 00:34:36.861 line:93%
But my friend next to me heard
what I said, and started to laugh.

00:34:36.892 --> 00:34:38.587 line:93%
Why do you think she did?

00:34:39.178 --> 00:34:40.704 line:93%
They deliver?

00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:42.669 line:93%
Yeah, they take phone orders.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.497 line:93%
(They deliver hamburgers these days?)

00:34:46.522 --> 00:34:49.055 line:93%
They started doing that long time ago!

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.680 line:93%
McDonald's delivers?

00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:53.400 line:93%
I bet your son knows how to order.

00:34:53.532 --> 00:34:55.493 line:93%
There's a separate delivery
company, they do the delivery.

00:34:55.556 --> 00:34:57.314 line:93%
No, it's not like that!

00:34:57.668 --> 00:34:59.548 line:93%
You don't know either?

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.267 line:93%
McDonald's does delivery?

00:35:01.298 --> 00:35:02.986 line:93%
I bet your son orders
delivery from them too!

00:35:03.025 --> 00:35:05.225 line:93%
I know they deliver pizza, but...

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:07.267 line:93%
They deliver themselves!

00:35:07.314 --> 00:35:10.647 line:93%
- You didn't know either, right?
- I had no idea.

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:13.181 line:93%
The viewers have to understand
this, these two are on

00:35:13.197 --> 00:35:15.220 line:93%
some of the trendiest shows on TV.

00:35:15.244 --> 00:35:18.212 line:93%
But they're so old-fashioned, they
know nothing about what's current.

00:35:18.259 --> 00:35:20.556 line:93%
You're happy that someone's
just like you, right?

00:35:20.588 --> 00:35:23.212 line:93%
(This old couple finds
strength from one another)

00:35:24.648 --> 00:35:27.337 line:93%
We used to walk 2 hours to buy makgeolli.

00:35:28.172 --> 00:35:29.772 line:93%
Just when were you born?

00:35:29.814 --> 00:35:33.657 line:93%
As years went on, you
started to lose hearing.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.900 line:93%
You kept talking to a busy signal.

00:35:37.994 --> 00:35:39.220 line:93%
"I want a hamburger..."

00:35:39.236 --> 00:35:40.821 line:93%
No that's not it!

00:35:42.649 --> 00:35:44.017 line:93%
You said it's from "M"?

00:35:44.064 --> 00:35:46.493 line:93%
You called McDonald's
and ordered a Whopper.

00:35:46.525 --> 00:35:48.548 line:93%
- What's that?
- You don't know what it is?

00:35:48.611 --> 00:35:49.923 line:93%
This isn't funny?

00:35:49.978 --> 00:35:52.126 line:93%
(How can you not laugh at this joke?)

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.462 line:93%
They don't sell Whoppers at McDonald's.

00:35:54.487 --> 00:35:55.962 line:93%
Only a rich guy like you know that.

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.181 line:93%
I'm not rich!

00:35:57.228 --> 00:35:58.884 line:93%
Whopper's expensive, we can't order it.

00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:01.056 line:93%
It's because you've got 60 million dollars!

00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:02.696 line:93%
I've never heard that word before.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.454 line:93%
It's a dollar more than McDonald's!

00:36:04.492 --> 00:36:05.508 line:93%
You heard of it?

00:36:05.572 --> 00:36:08.368 line:93%
How do you know "Whopper," when
you don't even have a wife?

00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:12.859 line:93%
That's got nothing to do with it!

00:36:13.239 --> 00:36:14.977 line:93%
(Sorry!)

00:36:15.002 --> 00:36:18.017 line:93%
You think you can say whatever you
want because you're good-looking?

00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:21.532 line:93%
I was about to order something on the side.

00:36:21.572 --> 00:36:23.361 line:93%
But I couldn't.

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:24.767 line:93%
That's why she laughed.

00:36:24.814 --> 00:36:30.157 line:93%
So something like Cole slaw, but
you couldn't remember the name?

00:36:30.338 --> 00:36:33.134 line:93%
So you said, "the picked lettuce thing!"

00:36:33.188 --> 00:36:34.782 line:93%
It was funny the way you described it?

00:36:34.807 --> 00:36:37.001 line:93%
That's a little similar.

00:36:37.642 --> 00:36:41.611 line:93%
"What do you have for side dishes?"

00:36:42.514 --> 00:36:44.247 line:93%
Hee-chul's getting closer!

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.634 line:93%
"Give me the snacks!"

00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:49.266 line:93%
No, I didn't say that.

00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:51.579 line:93%
Two letters.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.939 line:93%
"Do you have 'blank'?"

00:36:54.002 --> 00:36:55.704 line:93%
"Do you have dessert?"

00:36:55.775 --> 00:36:58.009 line:93%
"What side dishes do you have?"

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.900 line:93%
"Extra noodles?"

00:37:01.925 --> 00:37:03.657 line:93%
That's right!

00:37:03.682 --> 00:37:06.157 line:93%
(Looking for extra noodles
at a burger place?)

00:37:06.222 --> 00:37:07.970 line:93%
(Embarrassed)

00:37:08.612 --> 00:37:10.525 line:93%
That's so amazing.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.361 line:93%
- I thought it was wrong.
- Me too!

00:37:13.505 --> 00:37:16.509 line:93%
I asked, "What extra noodles do you have?"

00:37:17.532 --> 00:37:20.915 line:93%
I wanted to order fast, but couldn't
think of the word, "side menu."

00:37:20.939 --> 00:37:23.353 line:93%
"What extra noodles do you have?"

00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:26.415 line:93%
(Ridiculous mistake with
similar-sounding words out of hurry)

00:37:26.502 --> 00:37:28.712 line:93%
Do you make a lot of mistakes like that?

00:37:28.783 --> 00:37:32.423 line:93%
This happened before, during
an interview long time ago.

00:37:32.448 --> 00:37:34.689 line:93%
I was asked what TV drama
I enjoyed watching.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.673 line:93%
I liked "Kim Tak-gu the Baker,"
and "My Name is Kim Sam-soon."

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.196 line:93%
You said "My Name is Kim Tak-gu"?

00:37:40.228 --> 00:37:42.368 line:93%
Yeah, "My Name is Kim Tak-gu."

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.196 line:93%
Sometimes I mix up words like that.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.095 line:93%
She has a bit of a goofy side to her.

00:37:46.127 --> 00:37:48.220 line:93%
I was so surprised though.

00:37:48.259 --> 00:37:51.564 line:93%
Is it because I live alone
and I order in all the time?

00:37:51.634 --> 00:37:54.701 line:93%
How can you not know
anything about fast food?

00:37:54.743 --> 00:37:56.954 line:93%
I eat at home because my family's happy.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.446 line:93%
My family always eats dinner together.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.070 line:93%
Yes, of course.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.493 line:93%
What kind of a person orders in dinner?

00:38:04.509 --> 00:38:05.853 line:93%
Even I eat with my family.

00:38:05.878 --> 00:38:08.665 line:93%
Happiness comes from cooking together.

00:38:08.825 --> 00:38:11.189 line:93%
(Sang-min always eats alone too)

00:38:11.604 --> 00:38:14.532 line:93%
(We hope they will find some
new happiness this new year)

00:38:14.556 --> 00:38:16.368 line:93%
Next question!

00:38:16.713 --> 00:38:22.165 line:93%
I played a lot of fierce characters on TV.

00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:24.993 line:93%
I heard many things
because of my past roles.

00:38:25.111 --> 00:38:28.376 line:93%
But what do you think is the most
memorable from what people said to me?

00:38:28.486 --> 00:38:31.954 line:93%
Weren't most of the roles
you played exhilarating?

00:38:32.002 --> 00:38:35.790 line:93%
I took a lot of revenges, and
people found it relieving.

00:38:35.868 --> 00:38:38.392 line:93%
Yes, punishing the evil.

00:38:38.463 --> 00:38:39.986 line:93%
They weren't bad roles.

00:38:40.041 --> 00:38:42.368 line:93%
- It's a good thing?
- Yeah.

00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:45.946 line:93%
"Wow, Seo-hee! You're a top
celebrity but you're so frugal!"

00:38:46.009 --> 00:38:49.056 line:93%
"Your bag only costs 2,600 dollars!"

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.415 line:93%
"You're not embarrassed to
carry that thing around?"

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:55.142 line:93%
I heard this at a sauna.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.611 line:93%
"Seo-hee, you're so down-to-earth
and come to a sauna?"

00:38:58.674 --> 00:39:00.548 line:93%
"You're prettier without makeup!"

00:39:00.595 --> 00:39:02.431 line:93%
No, not like that.

00:39:02.666 --> 00:39:05.337 line:93%
It's something great for
an actor to hear.

00:39:05.368 --> 00:39:10.196 line:93%
"It's such a huge relief whenever
I see you take revenge!"

00:39:10.283 --> 00:39:11.587 line:93%
But in more detail.

00:39:11.642 --> 00:39:13.009 line:93%
And more condensed.

00:39:13.025 --> 00:39:15.958 line:93%
"I laugh and cry every
week because of you!"

00:39:16.002 --> 00:39:18.431 line:93%
"I live vicariously through you!"

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.556 line:93%
You're getting closer.

00:39:20.603 --> 00:39:24.032 line:93%
"Come to my house, can you
beat up my husband for me?"

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.064 line:93%
"I only watch dramas that you're on."

00:39:27.134 --> 00:39:28.876 line:93%
Almost there, very similar.

00:39:28.892 --> 00:39:32.220 line:93%
"I don't even look at any
drama that you're not on!"

00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:35.345 line:93%
"It gives me joy in life
when I see you act!"

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.767 line:93%
No.

00:39:36.822 --> 00:39:41.837 line:93%
It's not something someone told
me directly, but I overheard it.

00:39:41.931 --> 00:39:46.204 line:93%
You know how they gather
in front of a TV set?

00:39:47.412 --> 00:39:50.282 line:93%
I overheard them talk, and I
was so happy when I heard it.

00:39:50.447 --> 00:39:52.580 line:93%
They didn't know you were there?

00:39:52.634 --> 00:39:54.775 line:93%
They didn't know, I was covered up.

00:39:55.697 --> 00:39:58.407 line:93%
"I only watch dramas that
Jang Seo-hee is in."

00:39:58.454 --> 00:40:01.915 line:93%
"Every drama she's in is great!"

00:40:02.127 --> 00:40:04.618 line:93%
I'll say it's correct.

00:40:04.643 --> 00:40:06.243 line:93%
It's close enough.

00:40:09.941 --> 00:40:12.079 line:93%
The flowery road!

00:40:12.337 --> 00:40:13.196 line:93%
(Gets up reluctantly)

00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:14.845 line:93%
You shouldn't have done that earlier.

00:40:15.728 --> 00:40:17.150 line:93%
We gotta listen until the end.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.571 line:93%
It's the right answer, go on.

00:40:19.845 --> 00:40:21.779 line:93%
Does he pay you or something?

00:40:21.783 --> 00:40:23.383 line:93%
(Taking his time)

00:40:24.892 --> 00:40:26.329 line:93%
What's that?

00:40:26.369 --> 00:40:28.399 line:93%
- He missed the timing already.
- It's not that.

00:40:28.557 --> 00:40:30.997 line:93%
- We'll do it next time.
- You should catch this, you're next.

00:40:31.133 --> 00:40:32.868 line:93%
(Here's a new bride!)

00:40:32.893 --> 00:40:34.900 line:93%
I really hope it happens soon!

00:40:36.769 --> 00:40:38.501 line:93%
I won't leave you alone for this.

00:40:38.595 --> 00:40:41.040 line:93%
The drama I was in was about to come on.

00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:43.845 line:93%
And women hurriedly gathered
in front of the TV set.

00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:47.134 line:93%
"Jang Seo-hee is on, I better watch it!"

00:40:48.377 --> 00:40:50.353 line:93%
I felt so trusted.

00:40:50.384 --> 00:40:53.665 line:93%
They trust that the dramas
I'm on will be good.

00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:54.946 line:93%
Are you showing off?

00:40:54.986 --> 00:40:56.196 line:93%
Yes, I am.

00:40:56.221 --> 00:40:57.782 line:93%
Let me show off once in a while.

00:40:57.806 --> 00:41:00.103 line:93%
What was the highest rating you got?

00:41:00.142 --> 00:41:01.446 line:93%
47% viewing rate.

00:41:01.502 --> 00:41:02.806 line:93%
"Miss Mermaid," right?

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.030 line:93%
Almost half the country watch it?

00:41:05.275 --> 00:41:08.361 line:93%
It's incredible that her viewing
rate is that high at that time slot.

00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:10.423 line:93%
47% from "Miss Mermaid"?

00:41:10.448 --> 00:41:12.884 line:93%
You remember "See and See
Again" back in the day?

00:41:12.909 --> 00:41:14.759 line:93%
That one had 64% rating
as a daily soap opera.

00:41:14.783 --> 00:41:16.790 line:93%
With just 4% for the rival drama.

00:41:16.838 --> 00:41:19.548 line:93%
I asked what it feels like
when your drama only gets 4%.

00:41:19.603 --> 00:41:21.478 line:93%
They just shoot as long as
no one messes up a line.

00:41:21.503 --> 00:41:22.681 line:93%
"The kitchen scene, cue!"

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:24.517 line:93%
"How can you do this to me?"

00:41:24.549 --> 00:41:26.173 line:93%
"What do you want me to do?"

00:41:26.213 --> 00:41:27.751 line:93%
"Cut, to the coffee shop scene."

00:41:27.961 --> 00:41:30.009 line:93%
(Moving on so quickly like in real-time)

00:41:31.286 --> 00:41:33.431 line:93%
There's just no motivation to try hard.

00:41:33.486 --> 00:41:35.829 line:93%
There is that though.

00:41:35.861 --> 00:41:38.876 line:93%
When the rival drama
starts to do well first,

00:41:38.916 --> 00:41:41.900 line:93%
you feel a little nervous.

00:41:41.947 --> 00:41:44.478 line:93%
But it feels great when the
ratings start to change.

00:41:44.494 --> 00:41:48.212 line:93%
Is there a drama you were in
that didn't turn out so well?

00:41:48.565 --> 00:41:50.095 line:93%
Sorry, I'm gonna show off.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.142 line:93%
It's just a fact, but none, right?

00:41:52.189 --> 00:41:54.103 line:93%
Almost none for me.

00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:56.720 line:93%
You're a guaranteed success then.

00:41:56.759 --> 00:41:58.634 line:93%
I'm pretty fortunate with viewing ratings.

00:41:58.666 --> 00:42:00.853 line:93%
Can you guess our rating this week?

00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:03.642 line:93%
What did "Take Care of My Fridge"
get when you were on it?

00:42:03.674 --> 00:42:05.423 line:93%
You got 9% with Hye-min the Monk, right?

00:42:05.463 --> 00:42:07.596 line:93%
It came out well because of him.

00:42:08.843 --> 00:42:11.454 line:93%
How come you look like a Buddhist
monk too, but just your head?

00:42:11.517 --> 00:42:13.117 line:93%
(I didn't do anything!)

00:42:13.178 --> 00:42:16.579 line:93%
We would've gotten great ratings if a
real Buddhist monk came on this show.

00:42:16.604 --> 00:42:18.471 line:93%
He's here in Hye-min's place?

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:20.102 line:93%
It's so frustrating.

00:42:20.195 --> 00:42:21.795 line:93%
"Hong-min"!

00:42:22.767 --> 00:42:24.814 line:93%
(No hair in possession)

00:42:25.181 --> 00:42:27.431 line:93%
It's hard to guess that about talk shows.

00:42:27.485 --> 00:42:29.900 line:93%
I'm not so confident about
viewing rate for this.

00:42:30.009 --> 00:42:32.962 line:93%
Say it for us, "Kang Ho-dong,
I'll take my revenge on you!"

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.993 line:93%
So the older ladies will
watch our show too.

00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:38.329 line:93%
No, there's another line they love.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:44.861 line:93%
In "Temptation of Wife," my
husband killed me in the drama.

00:42:44.946 --> 00:42:47.392 line:93%
And all the moms were so mad watching it.

00:42:47.417 --> 00:42:50.907 line:93%
They get so upset as if it
happened to them in real life.

00:42:50.947 --> 00:42:53.525 line:93%
Then I come on the drama again
with a mole on my face.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:57.196 line:93%
I say a line like, "I'll kill them
first and go to hell for it."

00:42:58.088 --> 00:43:00.767 line:93%
I swear in front of you, God.

00:43:01.009 --> 00:43:05.189 line:93%
Let me kill my husband and his
mistress, and I'll go to hell for it.

00:43:05.356 --> 00:43:06.986 line:93%
They really loved that line.

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:10.767 line:93%
The momentary viewing rate just spiked.

00:43:10.853 --> 00:43:13.387 line:93%
It's a way for them to relieve stress.

00:43:13.744 --> 00:43:15.861 line:93%
(Bring back that emotion to Ho-dong)

00:43:15.899 --> 00:43:18.470 line:93%
I'll kill Kang Ho-dong
and go to hell for it.

00:43:20.065 --> 00:43:21.509 line:93%
I'll do it too!

00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:22.900 line:93%
Kyung-hoon, you too?

00:43:22.925 --> 00:43:25.212 line:93%
I'll open up the gates of hell for you.

00:43:27.572 --> 00:43:29.478 line:93%
(Trustworthy)

00:43:29.503 --> 00:43:32.103 line:93%
When does that train leave? I'll get on it.

00:43:32.128 --> 00:43:34.868 line:93%
(Hell-bound train is a popular one?)

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:38.954 line:93%
How funny.

00:43:39.002 --> 00:43:40.876 line:93%
That's all for me.

00:43:41.175 --> 00:43:43.642 line:93%
Let's hope for a great
rating, Monk Seok-cheon!

00:43:45.019 --> 00:43:47.152 line:93%
(While they switch their places)

00:43:47.617 --> 00:43:49.470 line:93%
Can you scratch my back?

00:43:51.606 --> 00:43:52.665 line:93%
Left side.

00:43:54.044 --> 00:43:55.689 line:93%
I can't believe it.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.126 line:93%
- Are you using me like your butler?
- It's not that.

00:43:58.189 --> 00:43:59.789 line:93%
That's good.

00:43:59.814 --> 00:44:01.657 line:93%
You should ask me more nicely as a friend.

00:44:01.712 --> 00:44:03.470 line:93%
I'll scratch your back too.

00:44:03.478 --> 00:44:05.095 line:93%
(They're becoming closer today too)

00:44:05.127 --> 00:44:06.915 line:93%
Here's the first question.

00:44:06.955 --> 00:44:10.540 line:93%
Everyone knows I have a
Thai restaurant, right?

00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:14.767 line:93%
But it was more than 10 years ago
when I started a Thai restaurant.

00:44:14.799 --> 00:44:19.696 line:93%
A customer came and
ordered a Tom Yum Goong.

00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:22.165 line:93%
And he said something to me.

00:44:22.189 --> 00:44:23.922 line:93%
What do you think he said?

00:44:24.157 --> 00:44:25.757 line:93%
Tom Yum Goong?

00:44:25.806 --> 00:44:29.220 line:93%
It was 10 years ago, not recently.

00:44:29.794 --> 00:44:32.540 line:93%
I'll bring up something old too.

00:44:32.595 --> 00:44:35.595 line:93%
"Poop" isn't in it, right?
["Tom" sounds like "poop"]

00:44:35.689 --> 00:44:37.501 line:93%
No way!

00:44:37.697 --> 00:44:40.618 line:93%
Jang-hoon is just so brilliant.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.480 line:93%
I knew it!

00:44:42.556 --> 00:44:44.196 line:93%
See?

00:44:44.424 --> 00:44:49.025 line:93%
Maybe it was a Thai person,
"You sure this is Tom Yam?"

00:44:49.563 --> 00:44:52.564 line:93%
"You're a fraud! This isn't it!"

00:44:52.619 --> 00:44:54.743 line:93%
"Leave, you liar!"

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.501 line:93%
"You bastard!"

00:44:57.532 --> 00:44:59.704 line:93%
"You're a terrible bastard!"

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:03.626 line:93%
(The Thai person was looking
for the taste of home)

00:45:05.716 --> 00:45:08.532 line:93%
"I smell makeup in this food!"

00:45:10.144 --> 00:45:11.298 line:93%
So close.

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.251 line:93%
"I smell skin lotion!"

00:45:12.291 --> 00:45:14.259 line:93%
"I taste my mom's cream!"

00:45:15.275 --> 00:45:17.439 line:93%
So close! Oh, sorry.

00:45:18.042 --> 00:45:20.025 line:93%
- Was it too hard?
- I'm OK!

00:45:21.502 --> 00:45:24.181 line:93%
Knock me out unconscious,
if you're gonna do that.

00:45:24.259 --> 00:45:27.829 line:93%
It's not about taste, but
it's about cilantro.

00:45:28.024 --> 00:45:30.189 line:93%
They didn't use it in Korea back then.

00:45:30.732 --> 00:45:31.884 line:93%
Oh!

00:45:31.916 --> 00:45:35.173 line:93%
Tom Yam... Tom Yum Goong...

00:45:35.267 --> 00:45:36.867 line:93%
"It smells like poop!"

00:45:36.892 --> 00:45:39.486 line:93%
(They thought cilantro smelled like poop!)

00:45:39.655 --> 00:45:43.415 line:93%
(Clap of certainty)

00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:46.993 line:93%
(Preparing the flowery road once again)

00:45:47.814 --> 00:45:49.611 line:93%
The customer called me to his table.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:53.462 line:93%
"Does it smell like poop
because it's 'Tom Yum Goong'?"

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.392 line:93%
He wouldn't be so nice about it.

00:45:56.157 --> 00:45:58.634 line:93%
This Tom Yam Goong smells like poop!

00:45:58.705 --> 00:46:00.439 line:93%
Say it with cuss words.

00:46:03.917 --> 00:46:05.821 line:93%
(Getting mad)

00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:06.931 line:93%
Try it again.

00:46:06.947 --> 00:46:09.446 line:93%
"Who'd pay for this poop-smelling dish?"

00:46:09.525 --> 00:46:11.407 line:93%
(Thinking hard)

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:13.986 line:93%
(Almost there!)

00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:19.470 line:93%
"How can you take money and sell
this food that smells like poop?"

00:46:19.495 --> 00:46:21.017 line:93%
That's right!

00:46:21.244 --> 00:46:23.259 line:93%
(What a relief!)

00:46:24.111 --> 00:46:25.711 line:93%
Here... Face-genius.

00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:28.689 line:93%
You were so close, Jang-hoon!

00:46:29.335 --> 00:46:31.493 line:93%
Jang-hoon's gotta be so mad.

00:46:31.573 --> 00:46:33.665 line:93%
So sad for Jang-hoon.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.032 line:93%
It was so close, but it was
a different expression.

00:46:37.098 --> 00:46:40.056 line:93%
"How can you sell food
that smells like poop?"

00:46:40.095 --> 00:46:42.282 line:93%
The customer complained.

00:46:43.811 --> 00:46:48.103 line:93%
How is it that I get every answer right?

00:46:48.158 --> 00:46:50.931 line:93%
Yet my answers don't count?

00:46:50.978 --> 00:46:54.150 line:93%
You said it last time
too, just cut and paste.

00:46:54.175 --> 00:46:56.282 line:93%
(Loss for words)

00:46:56.338 --> 00:46:58.462 line:93%
(Exhilarating to watch this)

00:46:58.487 --> 00:47:00.954 line:93%
(Kyung-hoon knows Jang-hoon the best)

00:47:00.979 --> 00:47:03.197 line:93%
I always get close to the
answer, every question.

00:47:03.266 --> 00:47:07.282 line:93%
It's a little too pungent for some,
Tom Yum Goong with cilantro.

00:47:07.361 --> 00:47:11.525 line:93%
I had so many complaints back in the day.

00:47:11.556 --> 00:47:13.095 line:93%
I served cilantro separately later on.

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:16.836 line:93%
Afterward, I left out the cilantro and
allowed them to eat it on preference.

00:47:17.141 --> 00:47:21.452 line:93%
- I don't like cilantro either. - How did
you get into the restaurant business?

00:47:21.477 --> 00:47:23.015 line:93%
- Why so suddenly?
- I...

00:47:23.149 --> 00:47:27.125 line:93%
- originally came out in 2000.
- That's right.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.921 line:93%
I stopped being an entertainer for 3 years.

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:31.375 line:93%
I really enjoyed cooking.

00:47:31.508 --> 00:47:35.894 line:93%
I had chronic sinusitis when I was young
and had complications after my surgery.

00:47:35.957 --> 00:47:37.490 line:93%
I can't smell anything.

00:47:37.844 --> 00:47:41.569 line:93%
That's why it's really hard for me to
smell or taste dishes when I cook.

00:47:41.594 --> 00:47:44.351 line:93%
It makes me concentrate more and...

00:47:44.532 --> 00:47:49.609 line:93%
on the other hand, I can eat all sorts
of dishes from around the world when...

00:47:49.938 --> 00:47:52.664 line:93%
other people can't because of the smell.

00:47:52.985 --> 00:47:57.726 line:93%
I realized it was an advantage that
I can eat a variety of dishes.

00:47:57.828 --> 00:48:00.836 line:93%
- That's really good of you to say.
You're being positive. - I overcame it.

00:48:00.938 --> 00:48:04.297 line:93%
I overcame my inferiority complex
of having chronic sinusitis by...

00:48:04.539 --> 00:48:08.851 line:93%
rapping with a raspy voice since
I kept hearing my nasally voice.

00:48:09.492 --> 00:48:11.492 line:93%
The reason I used a raspy
voice is because...

00:48:11.517 --> 00:48:15.493 line:93%
every time I rapped and heard the
recording, it sounded nasally.

00:48:15.696 --> 00:48:17.597 line:93%
You started to rap, like this?

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.652 line:93%
You couldn't hear my nasally voice
when I used my raspy voice.

00:48:21.852 --> 00:48:23.218 line:93%
That's how I overcame it.

00:48:23.243 --> 00:48:26.390 line:93%
Don't you get strange customers
when you run a restaurant?

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.422 line:93%
Of course, I do. I once had a
customer, who came in very drunk.

00:48:30.883 --> 00:48:34.014 line:93%
He suddenly began to
undress when he saw me.

00:48:34.039 --> 00:48:37.914 line:93%
- A male customer? - Yeah, a male
customer. I asked him what he was doing.

00:48:38.446 --> 00:48:42.508 line:93%
He started to scream, "I'm going
to set this restaurant on fire!".

00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:45.280 line:93%
He got something from the
corner and lifted it up.

00:48:45.305 --> 00:48:49.327 line:93%
He kept screaming, "I'm going to burn this
place down!" but we burst out laughing.

00:48:49.352 --> 00:48:53.812 line:93%
He was carrying a fire extinguisher. He
only had his underwear on while screaming.

00:48:54.696 --> 00:48:57.444 line:93%
"I'm going to burn down Hong
Seok-cheon's restaurant!"

00:48:57.469 --> 00:49:01.663 line:93%
I told him it was a fire extinguisher, but
he threatened to set the place on fire.

00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:06.648 line:93%
We called the police and he was
arrested with only his underwear on.

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.335 line:93%
- I had a lot of people like that.
- They were drunk.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.225 line:93%
A lot of celebrity couples come as well.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:12.555 line:93%
That's right, a lot of
celebrity couples go there.

00:49:12.743 --> 00:49:14.758 line:93%
- You came too.
- That was a long time ago.

00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:15.890 line:93%
- As a couple?
- Of course.

00:49:16.032 --> 00:49:18.281 line:93%
Who was it? We won't tell anyone.

00:49:18.321 --> 00:49:20.648 line:93%
- They came a lot.
- Who was it?

00:49:20.821 --> 00:49:22.686 line:93%
Was she older or younger than him?

00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:25.902 line:93%
What kind of guy did Hee-chul bring there?

00:49:26.992 --> 00:49:30.242 line:93%
He didn't bring guys. I
was surprised but...

00:49:30.914 --> 00:49:35.594 line:93%
Hee-chul prefers women, who are
very pretty and voluptuous.

00:49:36.469 --> 00:49:39.523 line:93%
- I wonder who it was.
- Hee-chul! You still got it!

00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:42.889 line:93%
- Why would you mention being voluptuous.
- They were all voluptuous.

00:49:42.914 --> 00:49:47.539 line:93%
My restaurant has different floors
and we also had a rooftop area.

00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:52.389 line:93%
I'd chat with him and his girlfriend
when they came to the restaurant and...

00:49:52.414 --> 00:49:55.836 line:93%
I'd leave telling them to text
me if they needed anything.

00:49:56.313 --> 00:50:01.000 line:93%
When I would go see them, I had no choice
but to leave them to what they were doing.

00:50:01.025 --> 00:50:02.430 line:93%
What the heck?

00:50:02.485 --> 00:50:04.285 line:93%
(What is he talking about?)

00:50:06.344 --> 00:50:09.326 line:93%
- What are you doing at a public place?
- I'm taking off work early today.

00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:10.351 line:93%
Hee-chul!

00:50:11.805 --> 00:50:15.242 line:93%
- That's where you eat! - What are you
doing at someone else's restaurant?

00:50:15.313 --> 00:50:17.219 line:93%
That was over 10-years ago.

00:50:17.336 --> 00:50:21.218 line:93%
- That's right. - Hee-chul's going to
get a lot of calls from Kyung-hoon.

00:50:21.243 --> 00:50:22.933 line:93%
(Caught red-handed)

00:50:23.391 --> 00:50:25.789 line:93%
"Me too! Introduce me too!".

00:50:26.492 --> 00:50:29.273 line:93%
- How nice.
- Their life is so fun.

00:50:29.852 --> 00:50:31.686 line:93%
This is my second question.

00:50:31.711 --> 00:50:34.452 line:93%
I had my first love when I
was in sophomore in college.

00:50:34.477 --> 00:50:38.273 line:93%
It was very innocent and the
love we had was beautiful.

00:50:38.883 --> 00:50:41.851 line:93%
While we were dating, he found another guy.

00:50:42.485 --> 00:50:46.359 line:93%
When I found out, I raced
over to his house.

00:50:46.774 --> 00:50:49.699 line:93%
What do you think I did after I ran to him?

00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:53.718 line:93%
You got a fire extinguisher and started
yelling that you'd set the place on fire?

00:50:53.743 --> 00:50:58.062 line:93%
- You only had your underwear on.
- He started laughing at what you did.

00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:01.726 line:93%
"Decide right now! Is it me or that b@$&#*?

00:51:01.985 --> 00:51:03.664 line:93%
Is it that b@$&#* or me?

00:51:05.071 --> 00:51:06.430 line:93%
- No.
- I think you're close.

00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:07.961 line:93%
I'm close again?

00:51:08.461 --> 00:51:09.725 line:93%
- I got it!
- What?

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.702 line:93%
"Kill me if you're going to leave me".

00:51:11.727 --> 00:51:16.027 line:93%
- Seo-hee, that's a bit... - Jang Seo-hee
kills first and asks questions later.

00:51:16.289 --> 00:51:19.855 line:93%
- It's like a line in one of her dramas.
- That's Jang Seo-hee for you.

00:51:20.118 --> 00:51:21.879 line:93%
(He doesn't hold back)

00:51:23.071 --> 00:51:26.358 line:93%
- He's hitting her harder.
- People usually go lighter on women.

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:30.930 line:93%
- You're so mean! - How can you hit
Kyung-hoon lighter than Seo-hee?

00:51:30.993 --> 00:51:32.969 line:93%
(Kyung-hoon is excluded)

00:51:33.211 --> 00:51:36.764 line:93%
- Did you get mad or were you hanging
onto him? - I was hanging onto him.

00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:40.882 line:93%
I had absolutely nothing since I had just
moved to Seoul from the countryside.

00:51:40.907 --> 00:51:45.953 line:93%
"I'll become famous as quickly as possible
and I can make you happier than him".

00:51:47.118 --> 00:51:48.730 line:93%
"I'll make you happy!"

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:53.451 line:93%
"I'll lather you with gifts and make
you happy after I become famous".

00:51:53.476 --> 00:51:54.678 line:93%
Hit him if he's wrong.

00:51:54.703 --> 00:51:56.382 line:93%
You have such great acting skills.

00:51:56.407 --> 00:51:59.234 line:93%
- Look at his dignity. Swag!
- It's very close.

00:51:59.524 --> 00:52:04.078 line:93%
I promised three things.

00:52:04.969 --> 00:52:06.475 line:93%
I asked him to come back.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:12.109 line:93%
"I'll do your laundry, sort your
recyclables and I'll cook food for you".

00:52:12.649 --> 00:52:14.000 line:93%
Kyung-hoon!

00:52:14.945 --> 00:52:16.965 line:93%
(Can't you get it right, Kyung-hoon?)

00:52:17.102 --> 00:52:19.750 line:93%
You're not hitting him as hard as me!

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:22.316 line:93%
- How come you hit me hard?
- Do you know about our friendship?

00:52:22.336 --> 00:52:24.480 line:93%
You're being unfair. My goodness!

00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:26.671 line:93%
Why are you hitting me so hard?

00:52:26.696 --> 00:52:29.836 line:93%
It's because you interfered
with his restaurant.

00:52:31.907 --> 00:52:33.269 line:93%
You went too far.

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.461 line:93%
"I'm going to get famous".

00:52:36.102 --> 00:52:39.328 line:93%
"I'm going to make a lot of
money and make you happy".

00:52:39.852 --> 00:52:43.297 line:93%
It's not broad, my promises
were very detailed.

00:52:43.399 --> 00:52:46.851 line:93%
"I'll quickly become famous
and buy you a car...

00:52:48.328 --> 00:52:49.637 line:93%
buy you clothes...

00:52:50.258 --> 00:52:52.004 line:93%
and buy you a house!"

00:52:53.039 --> 00:52:56.726 line:93%
Wait a second. You're getting
really close to the answer!

00:52:56.985 --> 00:52:59.078 line:93%
- I'll try.
- I promised him 3 things.

00:52:59.196 --> 00:53:02.430 line:93%
"I'll make lots of money
after I get famous and buy...

00:53:02.455 --> 00:53:05.625 line:93%
you a car, clothes and every
else you ever wanted".

00:53:06.133 --> 00:53:08.242 line:93%
(No, it's not that)

00:53:09.118 --> 00:53:10.311 line:93%
(Shaking all over)

00:53:10.336 --> 00:53:12.398 line:93%
What the heck is he doing?

00:53:14.289 --> 00:53:17.148 line:93%
"I'll buy you a house, a car and a beeper".

00:53:18.391 --> 00:53:20.488 line:93%
There are many kinds of houses.

00:53:21.274 --> 00:53:24.765 line:93%
- I got it! "I'll get famous...
- Good.

00:53:25.352 --> 00:53:27.303 line:93%
- "I'll buy you a car".
- Alright.

00:53:27.328 --> 00:53:29.014 line:93%
"I'll also buy you an apartment".

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.039 line:93%
He got it!

00:53:30.656 --> 00:53:33.937 line:93%
- He got it!
- It wasn't a house, but an apartment?

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:39.789 line:93%
The other guy had his own car
and lived in an apartment.

00:53:39.836 --> 00:53:42.969 line:93%
I told him I'll quickly
succeed as an entertainer...

00:53:43.571 --> 00:53:46.594 line:93%
and buy him a car and an apartment.

00:53:46.961 --> 00:53:49.234 line:93%
I asked him to come back to me.

00:53:49.391 --> 00:53:51.914 line:93%
- Did he go back to you?
- No, he didn't.

00:53:52.078 --> 00:53:53.796 line:93%
Why? What did he say to you?

00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:56.140 line:93%
He told me to stop nagging him.

00:53:56.594 --> 00:53:58.828 line:93%
- That's how he left.
- Did you ever see him afterward?

00:53:58.853 --> 00:54:01.887 line:93%
- I saw him after 20-years?
- How was he?

00:54:02.063 --> 00:54:06.508 line:93%
When I was dating him, I used to
always tell him he had deer eyes.

00:54:07.164 --> 00:54:09.922 line:93%
I saw him after 20-years had passed but...

00:54:10.008 --> 00:54:12.320 line:93%
He really became a deer?

00:54:14.328 --> 00:54:16.398 line:93%
I think you hit the nail on its head.

00:54:17.172 --> 00:54:21.421 line:93%
- He was drinking antler juice.
- He still had those eyes after 20-years.

00:54:21.446 --> 00:54:23.305 line:93%
It was very sentimental for me.

00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:26.030 line:93%
- That's what true love is like.
- That's right.

00:54:26.055 --> 00:54:27.851 line:93%
This is my last question.

00:54:28.071 --> 00:54:32.383 line:93%
When I was a high school student, I
lived away from home in Daejeon...

00:54:33.071 --> 00:54:37.625 line:93%
and while I was sleeping, I inhaled
fumes from a coal-burning furnace.

00:54:38.133 --> 00:54:43.617 line:93%
My older sister rescued me when she
came back home, late that night.

00:54:43.642 --> 00:54:47.633 line:93%
- That could've been disastrous.
- When my parents heard what happened...

00:54:48.313 --> 00:54:50.890 line:93%
my dad rushed to me from the countryside.

00:54:51.203 --> 00:54:56.250 line:93%
When my dad came for me, he did
something that made me bawl.

00:54:57.321 --> 00:55:01.046 line:93%
- Why do you think I cried? - When you
accidentally inhale fumes from coal...

00:55:01.071 --> 00:55:05.383 line:93%
people would say you'd recover quickly
if you drank dongchimi kimchee juice.

00:55:05.547 --> 00:55:09.969 line:93%
You saw your slicing radish to
make you radish kimchee for you.

00:55:10.524 --> 00:55:13.930 line:93%
It wasn't your mom, but your dad
making the kimchee for you.

00:55:13.955 --> 00:55:16.183 line:93%
- Is his father a good cook?
- Yeah.

00:55:16.305 --> 00:55:20.070 line:93%
- How was his approach?
- It was a nice approach.

00:55:20.852 --> 00:55:25.734 line:93%
He brought the coal briquette owner
and made him apologize to you.

00:55:26.344 --> 00:55:29.359 line:93%
Why would the owner have
to apologize for that?

00:55:29.571 --> 00:55:31.725 line:93%
Why didn't you say his dad
brought him crickets?

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:35.109 line:93%
I got it! I know the answer!
He brought a cow for you.

00:55:35.274 --> 00:55:37.445 line:93%
A cow! He brought a cow for you.

00:55:37.602 --> 00:55:40.321 line:93%
Your dad didn't have cash,
so he brought a cow...

00:55:40.346 --> 00:55:42.983 line:93%
and sold it to buy you a
better place to stay.

00:55:43.008 --> 00:55:44.819 line:93%
- He walked for days with the cow?
- That's right.

00:55:44.844 --> 00:55:46.944 line:93%
He brought a cow with him. A cow!

00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:50.398 line:93%
People in the countryside used
to sell their cows for tuition.

00:55:50.688 --> 00:55:51.688 line:93%
I got it!

00:55:52.524 --> 00:55:57.375 line:93%
He brought all his savings accounts
and said for you to use them to...

00:55:57.742 --> 00:55:59.551 line:93%
You should pay back your interest rate.

00:55:59.633 --> 00:56:01.155 line:93%
Pay back your interest rate.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.101 line:93%
In another word, he wants you to be quiet.

00:56:03.133 --> 00:56:04.750 line:93%
Who brought what?

00:56:05.336 --> 00:56:08.398 line:93%
Now, my mom and dad lived in the country.

00:56:08.711 --> 00:56:10.844 line:93%
But only my dad came to visit me.

00:56:11.102 --> 00:56:13.483 line:93%
- Your mom's letter!
- A handwritten letter?

00:56:13.508 --> 00:56:15.316 line:93%
Why would I cry about that?

00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:20.555 line:93%
- What could it be? - I got it! Your mom
told you to keep strong and stay alive.

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:24.444 line:93%
I got it! It was an
agreement for a new house.

00:56:25.617 --> 00:56:28.555 line:93%
- I got it!
- No! Don't hit me, don't hit me!

00:56:28.696 --> 00:56:32.030 line:93%
Why are you so clueless? We
already said it was a letter!

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:34.762 line:93%
- Stop hitting me!
- Why are you so clueless?

00:56:35.508 --> 00:56:39.734 line:93%
We were so close to the answer! Why
would you bring up a new house?

00:56:40.399 --> 00:56:43.171 line:93%
Tell her to go to the
corner and get some rest.

00:56:43.196 --> 00:56:46.890 line:93%
- Go away! - Your mother sent up
a recipe for dongchimi kimchee.

00:56:48.258 --> 00:56:49.367 line:93%
I got it!

00:56:51.055 --> 00:56:54.570 line:93%
I saw the letter, but the ink was smeared.

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:57.586 line:93%
- She was crying while she wrote the
letter. - Yes, a tearful letter!

00:56:57.735 --> 00:56:59.680 line:93%
The ink was smeared because of her tears.

00:56:59.705 --> 00:57:01.735 line:93%
It was my mom's letter but...

00:57:02.078 --> 00:57:04.507 line:93%
- I got it! You saw the letter...
- Yes, I read it.

00:57:04.532 --> 00:57:07.301 line:93%
It was actually a letter
for army recruitment.

00:57:08.344 --> 00:57:09.707 line:93%
You're kidding me.

00:57:10.368 --> 00:57:14.293 line:93%
My mom lived in the most
rural parts of the country.

00:57:14.363 --> 00:57:18.062 line:93%
Her education level didn't extend
to junior high or high school.

00:57:18.196 --> 00:57:24.062 line:93%
You mother was so shocked, she decided
to write her loving son a letter...

00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:28.172 line:93%
but her sentences had
misspelled words in it.

00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:32.851 line:93%
The instant you saw that letter, you
didn't know why but you cried because...

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.766 line:93%
you felt bad.

00:57:35.883 --> 00:57:37.320 line:93%
You got it!

00:57:37.523 --> 00:57:41.148 line:93%
She did everything she
could to educate her son.

00:57:41.399 --> 00:57:45.789 line:93%
Did I bring up a recipe for dongchimi
kimchee when it was this moving of a story?

00:57:46.102 --> 00:57:48.164 line:93%
My apologies, mother.

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.733 line:93%
- I'm very sorry.
- You should be.

00:57:50.758 --> 00:57:53.976 line:93%
Her handwriting was really beautiful.

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:57.187 line:93%
She wrote, "I'm so sorry Seok-cheon.

00:57:57.508 --> 00:58:02.039 line:93%
I wish I could've rented you a better
house but we just don't have the means.

00:58:02.328 --> 00:58:07.375 line:93%
I'm so sorry you had to suffer from
inhaling fumes from the charcoal.

00:58:07.703 --> 00:58:11.230 line:93%
I'm so sorry and I hope you
know how much I love you."

00:58:11.293 --> 00:58:15.875 line:93%
She wrote all that down, but I realized
she had misspelled words in her letter.

00:58:16.328 --> 00:58:20.039 line:93%
When I thought about how she
would be up at night...

00:58:20.625 --> 00:58:23.652 line:93%
writing this letter to me
while she was by herself.

00:58:23.735 --> 00:58:26.430 line:93%
I couldn't help but cry reading her letter.

00:58:26.712 --> 00:58:31.453 line:93%
- I know what you mean. - It was the
very first letter my mom had sent to me.

00:58:32.368 --> 00:58:35.351 line:93%
I was really moved by what she did.

00:58:36.437 --> 00:58:39.433 line:93%
(He's overcome a lot of
hurdles in his life)

00:58:40.098 --> 00:58:44.582 line:93%
(His dependable parents are who
made Seok-cheon, who he is today)

00:58:44.903 --> 00:58:50.176 line:93%
(The gods are arguing over
who has the most influence)

00:58:51.128 --> 00:58:55.098 line:93%
(What is going on while war clouds
hang over the god's palace?)

00:58:55.828 --> 00:58:57.836 line:93%
This is so frustrating.

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:02.640 line:93%
Didn't I send out a text message to the
shrines asking all the good-looking gods...

00:59:03.008 --> 00:59:07.414 line:93%
to gather around today? Where did
all the good-looking gods go?

00:59:07.703 --> 00:59:10.787 line:93%
How come all the gods that
look like this are here?

00:59:10.812 --> 00:59:12.797 line:93%
- Who the heck are you?
- Me?

00:59:12.961 --> 00:59:18.344 line:93%
- Are you human or horse? - I'm Centaur.
Human face with body of a horse.

00:59:18.684 --> 00:59:19.684 line:93%
(Neighing)

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.605 line:93%
(Taken aback)

00:59:21.946 --> 00:59:25.296 line:93%
I don't know if your face is the horse
or human. I think it was changed.

00:59:25.321 --> 00:59:27.351 line:93%
At least you're kind of cute.

00:59:27.524 --> 00:59:31.508 line:93%
- You think he's cute.
- He's cute compared to who we have here!

00:59:32.157 --> 00:59:35.359 line:93%
- Silence in the palace!
- Be quiet!

00:59:35.766 --> 00:59:38.578 line:93%
Let me present to you...

00:59:39.227 --> 00:59:41.992 line:93%
the goddess we sever, Aphrodite!

00:59:42.524 --> 00:59:46.195 line:93%
- We serve Aphrodite?
- The front and the back.

00:59:46.407 --> 00:59:48.749 line:93%
He wasn't talking about you, it was me.

00:59:48.774 --> 00:59:50.219 line:93%
It's me, Aphrodite.

00:59:50.422 --> 00:59:53.945 line:93%
- Aphrodite!
- Kneel down and praise her!

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:58.078 line:93%
- Poseidon.
- Kneel down and praise her, Poseidon.

00:59:58.218 --> 01:00:01.570 line:93%
Aphrodite! What's that
you have on your face?

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:03.656 line:93%
- What is it?
- It's beautiful.

01:00:05.314 --> 01:00:06.757 line:93%
(What is he talking about?)

01:00:06.782 --> 01:00:10.180 line:93%
I'm only letting this go because
you're so good-looking.

01:00:10.383 --> 01:00:14.070 line:93%
- What's that on your face, Poseidon?
- What?

01:00:15.469 --> 01:00:17.609 line:93%
Why do you keep talking bullshit?

01:00:18.211 --> 01:00:21.225 line:93%
- What's with the timing?
- Your line didn't make sense either!

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.897 line:93%
- His line didn't make sense.
- He just wanted to hit him.

01:00:23.922 --> 01:00:25.444 line:93%
Give it a rest if you
don't have anything good!

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:29.976 line:93%
- Isn't it a sight today? - Yeah, why is
everyone so ugly today? What's going on?

01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:33.555 line:93%
Let me introduce myself. I'm 9 feet tall.

01:00:34.266 --> 01:00:36.055 line:93%
The god of love. Cupid.

01:00:36.672 --> 01:00:38.789 line:93%
I'm Cupid. I'm sure
everyone has loved before.

01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:41.828 line:93%
It was possible for you to
love someone because...

01:00:42.352 --> 01:00:45.156 line:93%
I was the one, who shot my arrows your way.

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:49.312 line:93%
If that's the case, how come your
arrows never reached me? Why?

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.545 line:93%
If that's how you feel,
you'll fall in love with the...

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:55.438 line:93%
first person you see after
I hit you with my arrow.

01:00:57.656 --> 01:01:00.625 line:93%
- He was hit.
- He was hit with the arrow.

01:01:02.852 --> 01:01:04.633 line:93%
Where have you been all my life?

01:01:04.774 --> 01:01:06.195 line:93%
(Screaming)

01:01:06.856 --> 01:01:08.989 line:93%
Where have you been all my life?

01:01:09.016 --> 01:01:12.820 line:93%
(He begins to faintly
remember his previous life)

01:01:13.532 --> 01:01:15.391 line:93%
(Such a dreadful fate)

01:01:17.196 --> 01:01:19.944 line:93%
- What do you want?
- Where have you been all my life?

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:21.139 line:93%
(Cupid's arrow works like a charm)

01:01:21.164 --> 01:01:22.491 line:93%
I've been waiting for you.

01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:25.796 line:93%
- Do you really fall in love if you
get hit by your arrow? - Of course!

01:01:25.821 --> 01:01:29.281 line:93%
- How come you're not in love, if you
know so well? - I know! What happened?

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.109 line:93%
Did you shoot yourself
and then take it out?

01:01:32.344 --> 01:01:36.414 line:93%
- I was never shot by my arrow.
- Don't just shoot anyone.

01:01:36.461 --> 01:01:40.086 line:93%
It's time for me to introduce myself.
I'm god of the seas.

01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:41.777 line:93%
Poseidon

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.672 line:93%
Do you all know why the sea is so salty?

01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:50.390 line:93%
It's because I especially
marinated you in salt!

01:01:50.696 --> 01:01:52.141 line:93%
(Salted mackerel?)

01:01:52.352 --> 01:01:54.570 line:93%
You sure are a great jokester.

01:01:54.938 --> 01:01:57.711 line:93%
It's because my body is in the sea!

01:01:57.993 --> 01:02:01.297 line:93%
The sea tastes of my sweat and tears!

01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:03.055 line:93%
I marinated you well.

01:02:03.836 --> 01:02:05.418 line:93%
What did he do in the sea?

01:02:05.508 --> 01:02:06.754 line:93%
He farted in there.

01:02:06.922 --> 01:02:10.500 line:93%
Were your farts the
sounds of you screaming?

01:02:10.696 --> 01:02:15.570 line:93%
Sounds of iron and stone! Rolling thunder!
Bam, bam, bam!

01:02:16.063 --> 01:02:18.133 line:93%
(Stop while you're ahead)

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:20.359 line:93%
(Lovey dovey?)

01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:23.695 line:93%
- Doesn't that hurt?
- I told you to stop it.

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:27.133 line:93%
I already told you, it hurts!

01:02:28.313 --> 01:02:30.195 line:93%
I still think you're sexy.

01:02:31.031 --> 01:02:33.426 line:93%
(He wanted to try to ride the horse)

01:02:34.105 --> 01:02:36.508 line:93%
They're getting along well together.

01:02:37.571 --> 01:02:40.226 line:93%
(The two can't be separated after that day)

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:44.039 line:93%
I'm the god of beauty, Aphrodite.

01:02:44.438 --> 01:02:46.914 line:93%
I look good from the front and the back.

01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:49.887 line:93%
- You just don't look good from the side.
- Hey!

01:02:51.664 --> 01:02:53.711 line:93%
Anyways, my name is Aphrodite.

01:02:54.047 --> 01:02:55.555 line:93%
- She's a goddess.
- She's beautiful.

01:02:55.618 --> 01:02:59.363 line:93%
Every guy falls head over hells
for me whenever they see me.

01:02:59.539 --> 01:03:02.348 line:93%
I'm sure everyone here
will fall for me as well.

01:03:02.673 --> 01:03:04.211 line:93%
(His hand goes up)

01:03:06.422 --> 01:03:09.577 line:93%
I wouldn't fall for you, no
matter how beautiful you are.

01:03:09.602 --> 01:03:12.125 line:93%
My gosh! You guys are so ugly, very ugly.

01:03:13.946 --> 01:03:15.233 line:93%
- I'm...
- Who are you?

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:17.562 line:93%
The most handsome god, Narcissus.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.367 line:93%
You can't stand your girlfriend being
better-looking than you, can you?

01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:23.327 line:93%
You've broken up with them
for that, haven't you?

01:03:23.352 --> 01:03:25.601 line:93%
It's because I only have platonic loves.

01:03:25.852 --> 01:03:27.600 line:93%
I only give them my heart.

01:03:27.625 --> 01:03:30.507 line:93%
What was that you were doing
on my restaurant rooftop?

01:03:30.532 --> 01:03:31.600 line:93%
Was that platonic as well?

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:36.078 line:93%
How many times do I need to tell you
not to run any sort of business?

01:03:36.328 --> 01:03:39.897 line:93%
- Remove your knife. - You're not allowed
to do business in the human world.

01:03:39.922 --> 01:03:42.351 line:93%
Hello. I symbolize strength.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.882 line:93%
I can show you how strong
I am on the battlefield.

01:03:46.251 --> 01:03:48.758 line:93%
I'll show you my strength!

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:50.773 line:93%
(Screaming)

01:03:51.407 --> 01:03:53.359 line:93%
Hercules is using his strength!

01:03:53.716 --> 01:03:54.716 line:93%
Hercules!

01:03:55.461 --> 01:03:58.687 line:93%
(The palace starts to rumble
when Hercules begins to move)

01:03:59.032 --> 01:04:01.109 line:93%
(Don't hurt the gods)

01:04:04.985 --> 01:04:07.668 line:93%
(With one swift move from Poseidon...)

01:04:08.516 --> 01:04:10.469 line:93%
(Hercules is put down)

01:04:12.091 --> 01:04:13.476 line:93%
(Embarrassed)

01:04:14.578 --> 01:04:18.055 line:93%
- Your strength is amazing.
- You'd better be careful, Poseidon.

01:04:18.227 --> 01:04:21.144 line:93%
What are you going to
do if I'm not careful?

01:04:23.977 --> 01:04:26.375 line:93%
(He senselessly wags his tail again)

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:29.644 line:93%
Didn't I tell you to stop?

01:04:31.102 --> 01:04:33.647 line:93%
I told you to stop. Can't you
see I'm doing something else?

01:04:33.672 --> 01:04:35.436 line:93%
It doesn't hurt because I have muscles.

01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:37.719 line:93%
- My name is Eros.
- Ross?

01:04:38.196 --> 01:04:41.078 line:93%
Just as my name, I control love.

01:04:41.383 --> 01:04:44.570 line:93%
- Control? Is that right?
- Do you believe love exists?

01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:46.176 line:93%
Yes, love exists.

01:04:46.563 --> 01:04:49.117 line:93%
- Love exists?
- Doesn't love exist for you?

01:04:49.446 --> 01:04:53.496 line:93%
- Love doesn't exist in his world.
- I'll allow love to exist in your world.

01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:57.742 line:93%
- Let me ask you a question, Eros.
- What?

01:04:57.821 --> 01:05:00.601 line:93%
Why do people kiss when they fall in love?

01:05:02.852 --> 01:05:05.749 line:93%
They want to verify the
inner parts of each other.

01:05:05.774 --> 01:05:08.202 line:93%
- Inner parts?
- Can you show us an example?

01:05:08.227 --> 01:05:10.394 line:93%
- Come here, Aphrodite.
- I'll be your example.

01:05:10.719 --> 01:05:11.969 line:93%
I can teach you!

01:05:12.102 --> 01:05:13.945 line:93%
Teach him how to do it.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:15.387 line:93%
I'll teach you guys.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:21.445 line:93%
You'll learn how to kiss with LSM since
Apollo has never been in love before.

01:05:22.133 --> 01:05:25.672 line:93%
- Get close. - I don't believe love exits.
- Love does exist.

01:05:27.008 --> 01:05:28.485 line:93%
Get close to him.

01:05:29.282 --> 01:05:30.500 line:93%
I love you.

01:05:30.922 --> 01:05:33.117 line:93%
You two can put your lips together.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:35.172 line:93%
Seok-cheon!

01:05:35.743 --> 01:05:38.264 line:93%
He's not Seok-cheon. Go ahead, kiss him.

01:05:38.288 --> 01:05:40.272 line:93%
I'll give you one of my restaurants.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.328 line:93%
- You can stop Apollo.
- Eros, what do you think about Seok-cheon?

01:05:44.414 --> 01:05:47.203 line:93%
My love interest is Aphrodite.

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.221 line:93%
- We all serve Aphrodite.
- Of course.

01:05:51.246 --> 01:05:54.664 line:93%
- That's right. - It's not right for a
goddess to say, "That's right", Aphrodite.

01:05:54.801 --> 01:05:56.632 line:93%
- What should have I said?
- Can you speak more eloquently?

01:05:56.657 --> 01:05:59.163 line:93%
You're supposed to say, "You're correct".
Not, "That's right".

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:02.703 line:93%
- You're correct.
- I know who everyone is now.

01:06:02.969 --> 01:06:06.086 line:93%
Are you going to be on my side or not?

01:06:06.407 --> 01:06:08.913 line:93%
How come you keep trying to
take my gods away from me?

01:06:08.938 --> 01:06:10.375 line:93%
I want blood.

01:06:10.868 --> 01:06:13.867 line:93%
This is the start of the
all-powerful hammer!

01:06:13.907 --> 01:06:15.512 line:93%
Nothing but that!

01:06:15.758 --> 01:06:18.421 line:93%
Do you know how dangerous that hammer is?

01:06:18.446 --> 01:06:21.731 line:93%
- How dangerous is it?
- Yes, explain it to us.

01:06:23.008 --> 01:06:26.836 line:93%
The god of thunder, Thor's symbol! You
all should know the all-powerful hammer!

01:06:26.953 --> 01:06:28.038 line:93%
Yes, we know.

01:06:28.063 --> 01:06:30.101 line:93%
Are you listening to me, Thor?

01:06:30.336 --> 01:06:33.423 line:93%
- Thor is here?
- Bring your hammer to me, this instant!

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.085 line:93%
Really? Thor is here?

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:37.320 line:93%
Are you listening to me, Thor?

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.405 line:93%
- Thor is here?
- Bring your hammer to me, this instant!

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.234 line:93%
Really? Thor is here?

01:06:42.422 --> 01:06:44.616 line:93%
(Is Thor's hammer really appearing?)

01:06:44.641 --> 01:06:46.313 line:93%
- Thor!
- Thor!

01:06:47.422 --> 01:06:50.328 line:93%
- Thor! - Thor?
- The god of thunder?

01:06:51.477 --> 01:06:53.442 line:93%
- Who was that?
- Thor.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.715 line:93%
Why does Thor look like that?

01:06:56.016 --> 01:06:59.195 line:93%
I thought another celebrity
was going to show up.

01:06:59.703 --> 01:07:02.008 line:93%
I think it's really heavy.

01:07:03.914 --> 01:07:05.976 line:93%
Is it really heavy?

01:07:06.039 --> 01:07:08.801 line:93%
(Cupid gets hit while trying
to verify the hammer)

01:07:08.883 --> 01:07:10.382 line:93%
(How can you get fooled again?)

01:07:10.407 --> 01:07:12.000 line:93%
Run away, run away.

01:07:12.453 --> 01:07:14.477 line:93%
Okay, okay, okay.

01:07:14.696 --> 01:07:19.014 line:93%
- I'm not going to let you get away with
this? - How can a goddess be so scary?

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:20.343 line:93%
Why is a goddess so scary?

01:07:20.368 --> 01:07:23.046 line:93%
One person from each
team needs to come out.

01:07:23.071 --> 01:07:26.450 line:93%
You'll each take turns saying a word
that starts with a specific letter.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:30.139 line:93%
You're out if you can't find
a word within three-seconds!

01:07:30.164 --> 01:07:34.750 line:93%
The winner will have a chance to
hit the loser with Thor's hammer.

01:07:34.813 --> 01:07:35.813 line:93%
Alright!

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:37.770 line:93%
I'll give you the first letter.

01:07:38.133 --> 01:07:41.734 line:93%
- Gods are beings that appear in legends.
- That's right.

01:07:42.383 --> 01:07:44.953 line:93%
That's why we'll start words with "jeon".

01:07:45.547 --> 01:07:49.461 line:93%
When you hear someone say,
"Wow", you should turn as well.

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:54.461 line:93%
- You're not allowed to help him!
- How come you're telling him words?

01:07:54.657 --> 01:07:57.125 line:93%
- You're not allowed to help.
- Get ready!

01:07:57.414 --> 01:07:59.562 line:93%
- Start!
- Combat.

01:08:01.258 --> 01:08:04.695 line:93%
- One, two, three. You're out.
- War!

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:06.625 line:93%
You're out.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.860 line:93%
Hey.

01:08:09.055 --> 01:08:12.543 line:93%
You were taking too long thinking of a
word while pretending to be in war.

01:08:12.609 --> 01:08:14.311 line:93%
All you could think of was 'War'?

01:08:14.336 --> 01:08:16.437 line:93%
- War, war.
- Okay, I'll take it.

01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:18.328 line:93%
- You can start.
- Trolley.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:20.851 line:93%
Trolley! One...

01:08:21.235 --> 01:08:24.265 line:93%
- Two.
- You can't keep stalling!

01:08:24.383 --> 01:08:27.543 line:93%
- Jeon Yeong-rok.
- Good! I'm giving him a chance to think.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.344 line:93%
- Tactics.
- One...

01:08:30.602 --> 01:08:32.484 line:93%
- Two.
- I can see the past.

01:08:33.102 --> 01:08:35.305 line:93%
- Three! - Former life.
- Great!

01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:37.812 line:93%
Light bulb.

01:08:38.883 --> 01:08:41.851 line:93%
I beg for your forgiveness...

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:45.024 line:93%
your majesty!

01:08:46.118 --> 01:08:47.118 line:93%
Good.

01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:50.367 line:93%
- Exhibit.
- She said, "Exhibit"

01:08:50.735 --> 01:08:54.117 line:93%
One... two...

01:08:54.446 --> 01:08:56.367 line:93%
(Ho-dong is in trouble again)

01:08:56.485 --> 01:08:57.485 line:93%
Two...

01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:59.430 line:93%
Jeon...

01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:02.789 line:93%
- No! - Advance!
- He said, "Advance".

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.867 line:93%
- Advance.
- Didn't we already say 'advance'?

01:09:05.035 --> 01:09:06.695 line:93%
- No, we didn't.
- Advance.

01:09:06.907 --> 01:09:08.106 line:93%
One...

01:09:08.633 --> 01:09:11.922 line:93%
- Two. - 3-weeks treatment.
- She's bringing out everything.

01:09:12.118 --> 01:09:14.639 line:93%
- 4-weeks treatment.
- I can't accept that.

01:09:14.664 --> 01:09:17.059 line:93%
One! I can't accept 4-week treatment.

01:09:17.106 --> 01:09:19.913 line:93%
- It was a big accident if it
takes 4-weeks to heal. - One.

01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:20.938 line:93%
One.

01:09:21.485 --> 01:09:23.555 line:93%
- Two.
- Jeon...

01:09:23.969 --> 01:09:26.437 line:93%
- Two...
- I'll call it quits first.

01:09:27.610 --> 01:09:29.441 line:93%
Get hit before you go in!

01:09:29.813 --> 01:09:31.539 line:93%
- Come here.
- Hit him hard.

01:09:31.657 --> 01:09:33.457 line:93%
- I'm going to hit you hard.
- Aphrodite wins.

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:37.145 line:93%
- Where do you want to hit me?
- The stomach. - Yes, hit his stomach.

01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:39.047 line:93%
(Slightly nervous)

01:09:39.072 --> 01:09:40.897 line:93%
Poseidon is all about the stomach.

01:09:40.922 --> 01:09:42.559 line:93%
(Here I go!)

01:09:48.124 --> 01:09:51.053 line:93%
I think she hit him below the belt.
Much lower than the belt.

01:09:51.078 --> 01:09:54.188 line:93%
I think that was a bit
lower than his stomach.

01:09:54.438 --> 01:09:57.389 line:93%
You're supposed to tell him
before you start hitting him.

01:09:57.414 --> 01:10:00.647 line:93%
She suddenly hit him without any warning.
Are you okay?

01:10:00.672 --> 01:10:05.039 line:93%
- I'll get revenge for Ho-dong.
- I'm kind of afraid of Jang-hoon.

01:10:05.141 --> 01:10:06.621 line:93%
- Hey, Cupid.
- Yes?

01:10:06.672 --> 01:10:08.633 line:93%
I'm begging you again.

01:10:08.774 --> 01:10:11.617 line:93%
Can you keep it a clean fight?

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:16.264 line:93%
- Win or lose, could you please keep it
clean? - I'm very good at this game.

01:10:16.289 --> 01:10:17.663 line:93%
- That's great.
- Don't worry.

01:10:17.688 --> 01:10:20.561 line:93%
Aren't we gods that know
one another very well?

01:10:20.586 --> 01:10:24.430 line:93%
With that in mind, we'll
start all words with "Ah".

01:10:24.664 --> 01:10:26.428 line:93%
The first sound should be "ah".

01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:28.241 line:93%
- A lot of words that start with 'ah'.
- Yes, 'ah'.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.851 line:93%
Let's go. Get ready, set, go!

01:10:31.024 --> 01:10:32.024 line:93%
Furnace.

01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:33.399 line:93%
Americano.

01:10:33.875 --> 01:10:35.750 line:93%
- Mister.
- Kid.

01:10:35.969 --> 01:10:37.719 line:93%
- Elderly woman.
- Generous.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:38.875 line:93%
Arirang.

01:10:39.383 --> 01:10:41.078 line:93%
- One.
- Younger sibling.

01:10:41.328 --> 01:10:43.476 line:93%
- Brother-in-law.
- Scout group.

01:10:43.586 --> 01:10:46.999 line:93%
- Didn't we already say, elderly woman?
- I said, brother-in-law.

01:10:47.024 --> 01:10:50.914 line:93%
- She did? - We'll be the judges.
Can't you keep it clean?

01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:54.941 line:93%
I'll represent all the gods and
apologize on their behalf.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.734 line:93%
He's the most awkward god of all of us.

01:10:57.774 --> 01:11:01.191 line:93%
I wonder he ever gets up on
the right side of the bed.

01:11:02.141 --> 01:11:04.258 line:93%
- Reminiscence.
- Reminiscence?

01:11:05.664 --> 01:11:07.890 line:93%
Oh, no!

01:11:08.383 --> 01:11:10.422 line:93%
- Obstinate.
- Obstinate.

01:11:12.274 --> 01:11:14.625 line:93%
Assaravia Colombia!

01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:16.840 line:93%
Assaravia Colombia!

01:11:16.865 --> 01:11:19.813 line:93%
- What the heck? - That's her answer!
- Let's call it a game!

01:11:19.838 --> 01:11:22.742 line:93%
- We accept her answer!
- It's a saying we all know!

01:11:22.767 --> 01:11:25.034 line:93%
Can't you give me one more chance?

01:11:25.102 --> 01:11:30.648 line:93%
- Let's not do this. - Colombians say,
"Assaravia Colombia!" when they're happy.

01:11:30.868 --> 01:11:34.219 line:93%
Can't you let it slide one more time?

right, but I'm saying it's correct.

01:12:05.203 --> 01:12:07.937 line:93%
- Is 'linseed' a real word?
- Yes, it's a real word.

01:12:08.086 --> 01:12:09.086 line:93%
Linseed is a real word!

01:12:14.266 --> 01:12:16.405 line:93%
- She's being a patriot!
- It could be a title!

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:20.180 line:93%
I'll say that I lost. How long
are we going to keep this up?

01:12:20.205 --> 01:12:23.336 line:93%
- Let's keep going!
- That's a song's title.

01:12:23.469 --> 01:12:27.585 line:93%

the bag. - Aren't we merciful gods?

01:13:38.258 --> 01:13:40.921 line:93%
That's why, we'll start words
that start with the sound "Ja".

reelfish, king of the sea!

01:14:10.883 --> 01:14:16.078 line:93%

It's a really tasty fish?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.039 line:93%

- I'll hit him...
- That's the end of the game?

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:49.601 line:93%
May I say something? Can you
please tell her to give it a rest?

01:14:49.743 --> 01:14:53.207 line:93%
- What's wrong?
- She kept on saying, "Uterus" next to me.

01:14:53.232 --> 01:14:54.944 line:93%
What the heck am I supposed to do?

01:14:54.969 --> 01:14:58.133 line:93%
Uterus. Uterus. Tell him to say, "Uterus".

01:14:58.368 --> 01:14:59.773 line:93%

- The word qualifies.
- I lost! - She's so strange.

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:07.492 line:93%
When you talk about gods, we live
in a higher place than humans.

01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:11.436 line:93%
- Let's start with the words
that start with "Go". - Alright.

01:15:11.461 --> 01:15:14.422 line:93%
- I'm ready.
- Alright, Eros. One, two, three, go!

01:15:14.774 --> 01:15:16.453 line:93%
- Eunuch.
- Me?

01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:18.734 line:93%

- Pepper.
- Pepper.

01:15:23.971 --> 01:15:26.977 line:93%
Why are you looking at
me when you say that?

- Two.
- Anguish.

01:15:30.805 --> 01:15:32.648 line:93%
You know those big words?

01:16:05.586 --> 01:16:07.039 line:93%
Goguryeo.

01:16:08.922 --> 01:16:11.343 line:93%
Goryeo and Goguryeo were
both mentioned. One...

01:16:11.368 --> 01:16:14.055 line:93%
- Go...
- Stop it!

01:16:14.735 --> 01:16:19.906 line:93%
This is how Eros takes the
win for the games and...

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:22.305 line:93%
Aphrodite's team wins!

01:16:22.688 --> 01:16:26.187 line:93%

01:16:29.774 --> 01:16:31.866 line:93%
- My head? - Is that okay?
- It's okay.

01:16:31.891 --> 01:16:33.930 line:93%
If you're going to hit me...

01:16:35.164 --> 01:16:37.758 line:93%
I can't hit him because of the glare!

01:16:39.313 --> 01:16:42.453 line:93%
You can't hit him yet.
We're still in incubation.

01:16:42.836 --> 01:16:44.715 line:93%
It's the son of gods.

01:16:44.907 --> 01:16:47.437 line:93%
- Here I go.
- Go ahead, hit me.

01:16:48.547 --> 01:16:50.121 line:93%
Go easy on him.

01:16:50.578 --> 01:16:54.137 line:93%
(This is your punishment for
waging war between the gods)

01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:58.512 line:93%
- What's that sound?
- Gods!

01:16:58.774 --> 01:17:00.262 line:93%
Azarabia Colombia!

01:17:00.539 --> 01:17:01.539 line:93%
Is it Zeus?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000 line:93%
Could it be?

01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:07.015 line:93%
You fools!

01:17:07.235 --> 01:17:10.930 line:93%
- You're gods and you sit around fighting?
- It was you?

01:17:11.102 --> 01:17:14.864 line:93%
- I'm embarrassed that you guys are gods!
- Look, it's Mariah Carey!

01:17:15.039 --> 01:17:18.070 line:93%
Has Zeus always been this fat?

01:17:18.336 --> 01:17:21.258 line:93%
- He's gained more weight.
- God of all gods, Zeus!

01:17:21.399 --> 01:17:27.476 line:93%
It's me, Zeus! I'll assess each god's
ability to see if you need disciplining.

01:17:28.899 --> 01:17:33.594 line:93%
If you fail my test, you'll be
banished to the human world!

01:17:33.844 --> 01:17:35.930 line:93%
First, it's Cupid's turn!

01:17:36.328 --> 01:17:38.719 line:93%
I'll give you three arrows.

01:17:38.985 --> 01:17:43.570 line:93%
You'll be successful if you pop one heart
balloon with one of your three arrows.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:47.758 line:93%
If you fail, Hercules will
carry out my punishments!

01:17:48.486 --> 01:17:50.016 line:93%
(Screaming)

01:17:51.055 --> 01:17:54.539 line:93%
My punishment will be finger
flicks on your forehead!

01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:59.258 line:93%
Why does that fool get to
carry out your punishments?

01:18:01.018 --> 01:18:03.793 line:93%
(Steal a person's heart
with your love arrow)

01:18:04.352 --> 01:18:07.805 line:93%
Do you see the circle here?
You'll stand behind the circle.

01:18:07.907 --> 01:18:10.366 line:93%
- This is too far, I can't do this.
- Just do it!

01:18:10.391 --> 01:18:14.156 line:93%
- You're a god, anything is possible.
- It's possible for a god.

01:18:14.243 --> 01:18:16.219 line:93%
You only have three chances.

01:18:17.461 --> 01:18:18.461 line:93%
I'll go!

01:18:19.883 --> 01:18:22.445 line:93%
Prove your godly skills to everyone.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.507 line:93%
He has bad arrows.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.055 line:93%
Unfortunately, your first try is a fail.

01:18:31.094 --> 01:18:34.061 line:93%
Didn't you get zero points when
we had our shooting competition?

01:18:34.086 --> 01:18:35.135 line:93%
This is his second try.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.600 line:93%
It's when Kangta and Kang
Min-kyung were here.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:39.875 line:93%
Are you sure you're not blind?

01:18:41.806 --> 01:18:44.281 line:93%
- We're rooting for you, Cupid!
- Shoot it.

01:18:47.446 --> 01:18:48.788 line:93%
(Did his second arrow succeed?)

01:18:48.813 --> 01:18:51.234 line:93%
- Nice shot! - What?
- That's a fail!

01:18:51.297 --> 01:18:53.383 line:93%
- Why?
- It didn't pop.

01:18:54.024 --> 01:18:56.844 line:93%
- It has to pop.
- Are you serious? With this?

01:18:57.125 --> 01:19:00.344 line:93%
- Can you stop griping about everything?
- You can do it.

01:19:00.618 --> 01:19:04.328 line:93%
- Shoot your next arrow.
- You should've made the arrows longer.

01:19:04.664 --> 01:19:08.414 line:93%
- Just as I thought.
- You don't ever stop your griping, do you?

01:19:08.805 --> 01:19:10.648 line:93%
He never stops griping.

01:19:10.673 --> 01:19:15.235 line:93%
- Show me your perfect shot, Cupid.
- You're like constipation, it never ends.

01:19:15.578 --> 01:19:19.024 line:93%
- How come you're so straining?
- Show me your skills, Cupid!

01:19:19.141 --> 01:19:23.516 line:93%
- Show us your shooting skills. - Watch
him be totally happy if he succeeds.

01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:29.023 line:93%
It's unfortunate, but you failed, Cupid.

01:19:29.203 --> 01:19:30.848 line:93%
Hercules!

01:19:30.873 --> 01:19:34.496 line:93%
(Cupid's arrow will pierce your heart)

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:38.906 line:93%
Show him the strength in your hands.

01:19:39.056 --> 01:19:40.590 line:93%
(Recharging his battery)

01:19:40.805 --> 01:19:43.789 line:93%
I can't believe I have to
get hit by this shrimp.

01:19:44.243 --> 01:19:47.426 line:93%
To be honest, my finger
flicks aren't that strong.

01:19:48.485 --> 01:19:50.992 line:93%
My goodness, I bet that's going to hurt.

01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:54.047 line:93%
Can you show us again?

01:19:54.102 --> 01:19:58.140 line:93%
I'll give everyone a chance to see
if any of you guys can succeed.

01:19:58.477 --> 01:20:02.148 line:93%
- What's our prize?
- I'll give you Cupid's strength.

01:20:02.211 --> 01:20:03.516 line:93%
Even his fortune?

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.773 line:93%
If that's the case, I'll give it a go!

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:09.676 line:93%
What did you just say? You're
giving away all of Cupid's fortune?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.836 line:93%
- Even his buildings? - If you fail, Cupid
will be allowed to give you finger flicks!

01:20:16.774 --> 01:20:18.750 line:93%
(I'm going back to the sea)

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:24.321 line:93%
- Would you like to give it a try,
Aphrodite? - Yes, I wanted to try.

01:20:24.938 --> 01:20:30.226 line:93%
- Try, Aphrodite. - I'll give her a chance
to hit on me, if Aphrodite succeeds.

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.828 line:93%
- A chance?
- A chance?

01:20:32.853 --> 01:20:34.059 line:93%
(She gives up)

01:20:34.309 --> 01:20:36.532 line:93%
(She leaves without thinking twice)

01:20:36.985 --> 01:20:40.086 line:93%
- She's a very sensible god.
- She's very intelligent.

01:20:40.743 --> 01:20:42.582 line:93%
Clean this up, no one wants to try.

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:45.538 line:93%
It's now time for Hercules,
the god of strength.

01:20:45.563 --> 01:20:47.594 line:93%
Show me your strength.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.723 line:93%
- Bring the plywood!
- Plywood?

01:20:50.055 --> 01:20:52.172 line:93%
I'm sorry, but I'm out of strength.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:55.653 line:93%
- You can do it.
- What kind of god are you?

01:20:57.973 --> 01:21:00.860 line:93%
(Break objects with your
extraordinary strength)

01:21:01.172 --> 01:21:04.280 line:93%
- You have to jump and break these. I'm
going! - It's hard to break it all.

01:21:04.305 --> 01:21:05.976 line:93%
- Go for it.
- I'm going!

01:21:06.524 --> 01:21:10.281 line:93%
- Be careful not to hurt yourself.
- You have to put weight into it.

01:21:11.008 --> 01:21:14.223 line:93%
- You have to jump!
- I'm Hercules, the symbol of strength!

01:21:14.344 --> 01:21:17.234 line:93%
- Herclass?
- I'll show you my class!

01:21:18.419 --> 01:21:19.918 line:93%
(He's going)

01:21:23.094 --> 01:21:24.727 line:93%
(Smashes it all)

01:21:26.297 --> 01:21:28.641 line:93%
(The plywood has been smashed to pieces)

01:21:29.168 --> 01:21:31.418 line:93%
(We recognize that he is truly Hercules)

01:21:31.797 --> 01:21:33.621 line:93%
I accept you as Hercules!

01:21:34.219 --> 01:21:37.891 line:93%
(He's the only one that feels
awkward since he failed)

01:21:39.141 --> 01:21:41.434 line:93%
(Show your strength by
receiving your laurel wreath)

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.680 line:93%
- I'm going to throw it.
- This is for household use only.

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:47.469 line:93%
- Let's go.
- Start.

01:21:47.711 --> 01:21:50.586 line:93%
- This will be your first try.
- I'll throw it nicely.

01:21:51.493 --> 01:21:52.493 line:93%
He got it.

01:21:53.414 --> 01:21:55.328 line:93%
- Fail.
- Your second try.

01:21:55.532 --> 01:21:58.223 line:93%
- That's a shame.
- Try throwing it higher.

01:22:01.589 --> 01:22:02.813 line:93%
(Fits perfectly)

01:22:03.039 --> 01:22:04.422 line:93%
(I'm Apollo!)

01:22:04.774 --> 01:22:08.820 line:93%
- That's right, I'm Apollo!
- How did it fit right on your head?

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:12.047 line:93%
(He tries out of order)

01:22:14.157 --> 01:22:16.132 line:93%
(The head absorbs the
laurel wreath like its own)

01:22:16.157 --> 01:22:18.625 line:93%
- You're amazing.
- Yes, he's amazing.

01:22:18.766 --> 01:22:20.570 line:93%
- Good job.
- You're great.

01:22:22.063 --> 01:22:24.827 line:93%
- He's good at this.
- Your turn to throw, Aphrodite.

01:22:24.852 --> 01:22:27.176 line:93%
I'll throw it well for you to catch it.

01:22:28.789 --> 01:22:30.383 line:93%
My gosh, seriously!

01:22:30.789 --> 01:22:32.836 line:93%
That's why I can't play well with girls!

01:22:32.907 --> 01:22:35.469 line:93%
- You didn't catch it properly!
- It's your fault!

01:22:35.609 --> 01:22:39.172 line:93%
- I threw it well.
- You threw it too far!

01:22:39.844 --> 01:22:43.984 line:93%
Now, it's time for Aphrodite,
the goddess of beauty.

01:22:44.188 --> 01:22:47.555 line:93%
We'll take this time to verify your beauty.

01:22:47.868 --> 01:22:50.203 line:93%
Call a person you know and...

01:22:50.375 --> 01:22:54.680 line:93%
we need to hear the word 'beauty'
from them within 60-seconds.

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:58.160 line:93%
- The word 'beauty'?
- Yes, 'beauty'. Only one word.

01:22:58.883 --> 01:23:01.375 line:93%
You cannot ask them leading questions.

01:23:01.711 --> 01:23:03.076 line:93%
60-seconds is pretty short.

01:23:03.101 --> 01:23:05.953 line:93%
- Did you call ahead and plan this?
- No.

01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:10.484 line:93%
- It's the first-time we're telling
her the word. - Who are you calling?

01:23:10.563 --> 01:23:12.973 line:93%
You might know if you hear her voice.

01:23:13.243 --> 01:23:15.702 line:93%
- Let's go. - You don't need
to put it against your ear.

01:23:15.727 --> 01:23:19.516 line:93%
- What do I do? Do I just hold it,
like this? - 'Beauty' in 60-seconds.

01:23:19.868 --> 01:23:21.093 line:93%
Who could it be?

01:23:21.118 --> 01:23:23.187 line:93%
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:25.496 line:93%
- Oh, hi.
- You know what?

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:27.711 line:93%
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:23:28.391 --> 01:23:29.809 line:93%
- Oh, hi.
- You know what?

01:23:29.848 --> 01:23:31.770 line:93%
- I'm...
- Yeah?

01:23:32.539 --> 01:23:34.984 line:93%
People want to say something to me.

01:23:35.203 --> 01:23:38.578 line:93%
It's two syllables and
it's a great compliment.

01:23:38.938 --> 01:23:42.302 line:93%
- A word you think of the instant you
see me. - Sounds like Lee Young-ae.

01:23:42.327 --> 01:23:44.930 line:93%
- I think it's Lee Young-ae.
- Seo-hee?

01:23:45.602 --> 01:23:47.960 line:93%
- Is it Lee Young-ae?
- A two-syllable word that matches you?

01:23:47.985 --> 01:23:50.335 line:93%
- Is it really Lee Young-ae?
- It's Lee Young-ae.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.866 line:93%
- It's two syllables.
- Is it Young-ae from "Rude Miss Young-ae"?

01:23:52.891 --> 01:23:54.961 line:93%
- Two syllables?
- Yes.

01:23:55.547 --> 01:23:58.032 line:93%
People use this word
with you a lot as well.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.575 line:93%
- 30-seconds. - They call you this a
lot. 2-syllables. - I don't know.

01:24:03.735 --> 01:24:05.695 line:93%
They use this word to describe you.

01:24:06.461 --> 01:24:09.311 line:93%
It's sort of like goddess. They use
this word to describe me as well.

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:12.523 line:93%
- B and S! B and S! - A goddess?
- B and S!

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.195 line:93%
- It starts with 'B'?
- No, that's not right.

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:18.719 line:93%
- 10-seconds left.
- It's two-syllables.

01:24:19.047 --> 01:24:21.280 line:93%
- It starts with 'B' and has an 'S'?
- No, no.

01:24:21.305 --> 01:24:22.914 line:93%
Princess? Queen?

01:24:23.172 --> 01:24:24.836 line:93%
You're getting close.

01:24:24.994 --> 01:24:27.553 line:93%
- Princess, queen.
- It's similar to princess.

01:24:27.578 --> 01:24:28.578 line:93%
One!

01:24:29.039 --> 01:24:30.039 line:93%
Fail!

01:24:32.352 --> 01:24:33.805 line:93%
- Who is it?
- You failed.

01:24:33.961 --> 01:24:38.578 line:93%
- Who is it? - My friends are goddesses
as well since I'm Aphrodite.

01:24:38.789 --> 01:24:40.273 line:93%
- Who is it?
- The goddess of beauty.

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.453 line:93%
- Who is it?
- Lee Young-ae.

01:24:43.743 --> 01:24:44.743 line:93%
Hello?

01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:50.961 line:93%
I'm sorry for calling. I'm recording
"Ask Us Anything" right now.

01:24:51.125 --> 01:24:54.906 line:93%
- No, it's okay. - I'm sorry, we
each had separate challenges.

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:57.522 line:93%
- She's like air in our lives.
- I'm playing Aphrodite.

01:24:57.547 --> 01:24:59.812 line:93%
I was hoping you'd call Jang Dong-gun.

01:24:59.899 --> 01:25:01.991 line:93%
Does she know "Ask Us Anything"?

01:25:02.016 --> 01:25:04.444 line:93%
- Say, "Hello".
- Hello, everyone. - Hello!

01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:07.601 line:93%
- It's me, Soo-geun.
- Yes, it's good to hear from you.

01:25:07.711 --> 01:25:10.413 line:93%
- Happy new year.
- Yes, happy new year to you as well.

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:13.445 line:93%
Seo-hee is on "Ask Us
Anything's" recording studio.

01:25:13.696 --> 01:25:17.645 line:93%
- Yes, please be good to her.
- We didn't know you'd answer the phone.

01:25:17.805 --> 01:25:20.051 line:93%
She failed her challenge because of you.

01:25:20.076 --> 01:25:25.297 line:93%
Her penalty is for you to come on the
show next week or within the next month.

01:25:26.328 --> 01:25:29.210 line:93%
- You can come over to my house.
- Whoa! Really?

01:25:29.235 --> 01:25:31.586 line:93%
- We can go.
- We'll really go over.

01:25:31.969 --> 01:25:35.789 line:93%
- You can come over without the cameras.
- Say hello, Ho-dong.

01:25:36.211 --> 01:25:38.648 line:93%
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

01:25:38.711 --> 01:25:43.012 line:93%
Can you say something about your friend,
Seo-hee, since we're on the air?

01:25:43.196 --> 01:25:45.305 line:93%
It's always the same with us.

01:25:45.836 --> 01:25:50.297 line:93%
She's a good person. She hasn't
changed in 10 or 20-years.

01:25:50.774 --> 01:25:52.664 line:93%
It's Seok-cheon, Young-ae.

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:55.125 line:93%
- I'm sorry, who?
- Seok-cheon!

01:25:55.274 --> 01:25:56.750 line:93%
- Hong Seok-cheon?
- Yes.

01:25:56.868 --> 01:25:59.273 line:93%
When did you go over there?

01:26:00.024 --> 01:26:02.367 line:93%
I'm on the show with Seo-hee today.

01:26:03.188 --> 01:26:06.047 line:93%
- That's great to hear. - Let's come
on the show together next time.

01:26:06.118 --> 01:26:09.551 line:93%

- It's me, Young-ja. Lee Young-ja.
- Nice to hear from you!

01:26:15.555 --> 01:26:17.562 line:93%
How have you been doing?

01:26:19.328 --> 01:26:23.351 line:93%
- I'm sorry, it's me Kim Yeong-cheol. I
was impersonating... - I already knew.

01:26:23.734 --> 01:26:27.742 line:93%
- She must watch our show.
- Yes, I don't miss an episode.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:29.418 line:93%
Thank you very much.

01:26:29.868 --> 01:26:33.273 line:93%

01:26:35.836 --> 01:26:37.211 line:93%
Have a good time!

01:26:38.118 --> 01:26:40.676 line:93%
- I'll call you later.
- Okay, do well.

01:26:41.461 --> 01:26:43.203 line:93%
You guys must be close.

01:26:43.453 --> 01:26:47.817 line:93%
Did you hear her voice? Pretty girls
must only be friends with pretty people.

01:26:48.743 --> 01:26:51.655 line:93%
We've been friends for a long time.
About 20-years?

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.086 line:93%
We were in the same historical drama.

01:26:54.164 --> 01:26:58.551 line:93%
(The two met on the same drama
and their friendship lasted)

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.749 line:93%
This is our last challenge. It's
Poseidon's turn, the god of the seas.

01:27:02.774 --> 01:27:07.320 line:93%
Since you control the waters,
please show us your ability.

01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:11.164 line:93%
We're going to bring out 100 candles.
Bring out the candles!

01:27:11.735 --> 01:27:13.781 line:93%
- Bring out the candles.
- Bring it out!

01:27:13.899 --> 01:27:16.546 line:93%
- Bring the candles.
- What am I supposed to do?

01:27:16.571 --> 01:27:18.172 line:93%
Listen carefully, Poseidon.

01:27:18.493 --> 01:27:22.073 line:93%
We have 100 candles here,
but you need to blow...

01:27:22.098 --> 01:27:25.750 line:93%
out 70 or more candles by
blowing water onto them.

01:27:25.993 --> 01:27:29.758 line:93%
If you fail, a tremendous
punishment will be waiting for you.

01:27:31.125 --> 01:27:33.633 line:93%
Who will hand out your punishment?

01:27:34.305 --> 01:27:36.649 line:93%
- The half horse can do it.
- I'll do it.

01:27:36.907 --> 01:27:38.514 line:93%
Anyone here can hand out punishments.

01:27:38.539 --> 01:27:41.731 line:93%
Anyone! Or Centaur can
hand out punishments, too.

01:27:42.227 --> 01:27:43.789 line:93%
Please fail. Fail.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.609 line:93%
- If Poseidon allows it...
- Yes? - You can do anything.

01:27:48.055 --> 01:27:49.867 line:93%
- I'm going!
- Go ahead.

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.086 line:93%
Poseidon!

01:27:52.696 --> 01:27:55.203 line:93%
I bet he's going to splash everyone.

01:27:55.368 --> 01:27:58.640 line:93%
- This is today's highlight.
- How much can fit in there?

01:28:00.235 --> 01:28:01.801 line:93%
(Splashes)

01:28:08.754 --> 01:28:11.528 line:93%
(More than half of the
candles are blown out?)

01:28:13.477 --> 01:28:17.106 line:93%
- He failed. He didn't do it.
- The candles are lighting back up.

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:21.913 line:93%
- He failed. He didn't do it.
- The candles are lighting back up.

01:28:21.938 --> 01:28:24.155 line:93%
It'll be faster to count
the ones that are off.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.890 line:93%
- It's only half.
- He failed.

01:28:26.203 --> 01:28:28.969 line:93%
(What is the total?)

01:28:29.274 --> 01:28:33.820 line:93%
Poseidon fails since more than
40 candles are still lit!

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:38.601 line:93%
I finally have my chance!

01:28:38.695 --> 01:28:41.407 line:93%
- Go ahead, Centaur.
- There's something more important.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.203 line:93%
If Centaur can do the same challenge...

01:28:44.688 --> 01:28:47.812 line:93%
and blow out more than 70 candles...

01:28:48.016 --> 01:28:50.461 line:93%
- I'll take five finger flicks!
- That's a great offer.

01:28:50.672 --> 01:28:52.508 line:93%
- But...
- I'll take your offer.

01:28:52.625 --> 01:28:55.383 line:93%
- What if I fail?
- I'll only hit you once.

01:28:55.774 --> 01:28:59.946 line:93%
- I'll accept your offer of hitting
5-times. - That's how gambling works.

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.797 line:93%
Alright, Centaur!

01:29:03.399 --> 01:29:06.180 line:93%
This will be your last challenge.

01:29:07.274 --> 01:29:10.530 line:93%
- He always successful on these challenges.
- Strangely, he's good at this.

01:29:10.555 --> 01:29:13.805 line:93%
Will Centaur be able to blow
out more than 70 candles?

01:29:21.164 --> 01:29:23.032 line:93%
(He only gets the corners)

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:24.391 line:93%
Fail.

01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:27.125 line:93%
Poseidon.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.468 line:93%
Wait a second! Can anyone
blow out 70 candles? Try it.

01:29:30.493 --> 01:29:33.437 line:93%
- I'll get hit 100-times if you succeed.
- 100-times?

01:29:33.586 --> 01:29:34.586 line:93%
Eros!

01:29:35.391 --> 01:29:37.702 line:93%
- Try it.
- If he succeeds, it's 100 finger flicks!

01:29:37.727 --> 01:29:40.864 line:93%
It's impossible to blow
out more than 70 candles.

01:29:41.135 --> 01:29:43.118 line:93%
He's never going to succeed.

01:29:43.555 --> 01:29:45.992 line:93%
- It's impossible.
- Even Ho-dong couldn't do it.

01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:47.946 line:93%
Try it again, Poseidon.

01:29:48.188 --> 01:29:51.203 line:93%
(Why is Seo-hee moving
away from the cameras?)

01:29:51.618 --> 01:29:53.907 line:93%
All the candles can still be lit.

01:29:54.616 --> 01:29:56.496 line:93%
(Spits out water)

01:29:57.219 --> 01:30:00.742 line:93%
What are you doing over there?
Are you going to try?

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:05.867 line:93%
- I was testing it out. - What are you
doing here? - I was just trying it.

01:30:06.047 --> 01:30:07.906 line:93%
- Do you want to try?
- Yes, I do.

01:30:08.016 --> 01:30:11.480 line:93%
I don't think it's possible. I
tried it, but it's not easy.

01:30:11.766 --> 01:30:12.766 line:93%
Try it.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.633 line:93%
- It's Eros' first attempt.
- It's impossible.

01:30:17.727 --> 01:30:18.727 line:93%
Eros!

01:30:19.633 --> 01:30:20.633 line:93%
Eros!

01:30:24.898 --> 01:30:26.351 line:93%
(He fires away)

01:30:30.553 --> 01:30:33.289 line:93%
(He precisely attacks the middle)

01:30:35.672 --> 01:30:37.082 line:93%
I think he's close.

01:30:37.235 --> 01:30:39.930 line:93%
- 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
- He did it. He got it.

01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:42.508 line:93%
(Starts to step back)

01:30:43.016 --> 01:30:45.555 line:93%
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27! Twenty-seven!

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:47.922 line:93%
(He successfully blows out 73 candles)

01:30:47.961 --> 01:30:52.492 line:93%
He succeeds in blowing out 73 candles!
We can hit Centaur 100-times!

01:30:52.766 --> 01:30:54.664 line:93%
- That's amazing!
- 73 candles!

01:30:54.703 --> 01:30:57.633 line:93%
You needed to attack the
middle, not the sides.

01:30:58.149 --> 01:31:00.320 line:93%
100 finger flicks.

01:31:00.774 --> 01:31:02.383 line:93%
Go first, Poseidon.

01:31:02.547 --> 01:31:05.430 line:93%
- I'll go lightly.
- We can do five each.

01:31:05.594 --> 01:31:06.953 line:93%
Close your eyes.

01:31:07.516 --> 01:31:09.647 line:93%
- That's one.
- That's not too bad.

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:11.949 line:93%
You have 99 more hits to go.

01:31:13.172 --> 01:31:16.226 line:93%
We should all watch what
we say in the new year.

01:31:16.274 --> 01:31:17.274 line:93%
(Bam!)

01:31:19.055 --> 01:31:22.730 line:93%
- That looks painful.
- Are you sure you didn't slap him?

01:31:23.553 --> 01:31:26.933 line:93%
(Centaur got hit 98 more times
and became human again)

01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:29.898 line:93%
It's Seo-hee's birthday.

01:31:30.899 --> 01:31:34.289 line:93%
(Surprise!)

01:31:34.493 --> 01:31:35.493 line:93%
(Moved)

01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:38.308 line:93%
(Happy birthday)

01:31:41.586 --> 01:31:45.062 line:93%
- Hold on, I'll blow it out with my water.
- No, it's okay.

01:31:45.657 --> 01:31:47.711 line:93%
Close your eyes and make a wish.

01:31:47.995 --> 01:31:52.070 line:93%
(We wish the elite actress, Jang
Seo-hee, a very happy birthday)

01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:56.543 line:93%
(We'll have previews of transfer
students Boa and Lee Sang-yeob.

01:31:57.462 --> 01:31:59.441 line:93%
(Boa and Lee Sang-yeob)

01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:04.686 line:93%
My goodness, our managing director!
It's great to see you here!

01:32:04.711 --> 01:32:07.500 line:93%
- Wait a second!
- Isn't that Park Hyun-bin?

01:32:07.828 --> 01:32:09.824 line:93%
(It's Park Hyun-bin)

01:32:12.759 --> 01:32:15.273 line:93%
(He shows us his hidden impersonations)

01:32:15.664 --> 01:32:16.664 line:93%
(He's good)

01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:18.319 line:93%
That's a good one.

01:32:18.344 --> 01:32:22.030 line:93%
- I'm on "Ask Us Anything" today.
- That sounds just like him!

01:32:22.055 --> 01:32:24.695 line:93%
(Where is the real Lee Sang-min?)

01:32:28.227 --> 01:32:31.562 line:93%
My goodness, we're taking
it easy on her today.

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:34.719 line:93%
This is a broadcasting accident.

01:32:35.833 --> 01:32:38.781 line:93%
(The star of Asia slowly begins
to show her real talents)

01:32:38.809 --> 01:32:42.276 line:93%
(She dances to girl group songs
and even Kyung-hoon's dance)

01:32:42.301 --> 01:32:45.301 line:93%
(There's nothing the
dancing machine can't do)

01:32:45.379 --> 01:32:47.155 line:93%
Have you eaten already?

01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:49.500 line:93%
(The impersonating machine can't stop)

01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:51.351 line:93%
Stop it! Stop it!

01:32:51.703 --> 01:32:54.238 line:93%
It's not easy being
annoying on the first day.

01:32:54.375 --> 01:32:55.375 line:93%
(Ashamed)

01:32:55.767 --> 01:32:58.562 line:93%
- Here you go.
- Is it soju mixed with beer?

01:32:59.149 --> 01:33:00.844 line:93%
Jang-hoon! Sit down.

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:05.480 line:93%

the cast of "Ask Us Anything")

01:33:06.125 --> 01:33:08.566 line:93%
(The little giant takes over the school)

01:33:09.024 --> 01:33:10.024 line:93%

(Every Saturday night at 8:50)

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:15.863 line:93%
It's your lucky day since
you get to meet the perfect...

01:33:15.888 --> 01:33:19.117 line:93%
woman, who has a great body,
personality and even face.

01:33:19.711 --> 01:33:21.414 line:93%
- Boa.
- What?

01:33:21.532 --> 01:33:24.523 line:93%
That's not your image! Don't lie to us!

01:33:25.875 --> 01:33:28.781 line:93%
- I'm getting scared of him.
- Don't leave me!

01:33:28.805 --> 01:33:30.805 line:93%
