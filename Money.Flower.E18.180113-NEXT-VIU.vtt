00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.182
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:23.772
Kang Pil Joo.

3
00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:44.396
(Pil Joo)

4
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.179
(Mo Hyun)

5
00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.269
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.409
Mr. Jang Boo Cheon.

7
00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:18.179
Mother.

8
00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.808
Grandfather.

9
00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:28.919
Did everyone know...

10
00:02:30.688 --> 00:02:32.259
about me from the start?

11
00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.588
Yes.

12
00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.098
What about Uncle Jang?

13
00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.538
Him too.

14
00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:49.338
Even Director Jang Yeo Cheon knew it too.

15
00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:52.438
Everyone...

16
00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:57.449
must have had fun...

17
00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.149
watching me,

18
00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:09.528
a stupid girl who came to live at Mooshimwon.

19
00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.769
Yong Goo.

20
00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:58.979
I saw Pil Joo's car outside before I came in here.

21
00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:07.688
Where are Pil Joo and Mo Hyun?

22
00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:22.869
Mo Hyun.

23
00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.079
You jerk!

24
00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:37.678
Boo Cheon.

25
00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:41.889
Let's go home.

26
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.168
Let's check the last stage of the project.

27
00:05:02.738 --> 00:05:03.738
Pil Joo.

28
00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:06.809
<v ->This isn't the right time. - Yes, it is.</v>

29
00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.509
We must act now.

30
00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:12.149
Right now.

31
00:05:21.158 --> 00:05:22.189
Mo Hyun.

32
00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:36.439
I'm relieved, Boo Cheon.

33
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.048
From the marriage Kang Pil Joo has set up,

34
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:48.019
the love between us is real,

35
00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:52.988
but now,

36
00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.129
I don't have anything left...

37
00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.098
because you disregarded our relationship.

38
00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.199
<v ->Let's start. - Okay.</v>

39
00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.809
Just like you suggested, when Cheong A Bio is the holding company,

40
00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.949
I played around to see how I can group the affiliated companies.

41
00:06:48.178 --> 00:06:50.949
We must hurry to get Daeil Distribution listed.

42
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.619
In order to make Cheong A Bio the holding company,

43
00:06:53.778 --> 00:06:55.319
we must expedite getting Daeil Distribution listed...

44
00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.149
and merging these two companies.

45
00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:00.389
Later on, when we consolidate Cheong A Bio and Trading,

46
00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:02.088
we must make sure Cheong A Bio...

47
00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:04.658
has legal authorities over every affiliated company of Cheong A.

48
00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.858
Even if he is not a president anymore,

49
00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:09.399
do you think Jang Seong Man will let this happen?

50
00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.238
I'm sure he will try to stop this...

51
00:07:11.468 --> 00:07:12.738
with everything he's got.

52
00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.108
And I plan on stopping...

53
00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:17.509
every trick he plays...

54
00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:19.778
with everything I have too.

55
00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:24.379
So you will make Cheong A Bio the holding company...

56
00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.678
and make Jang Boo Cheon the chairman.

57
00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:29.019
What's next?

58
00:07:29.588 --> 00:07:30.749
I'm going to bring up a suit...

59
00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:34.689
to revoke every inheritance Jang Boo Cheon has received...

60
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:37.288
from Honorary Chairman Jang.

61
00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:40.999
As it's been over 10 years since he received shares of Daeil,

62
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:42.329
I can't get it back.

63
00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:46.168
But every inheritance that's been given in advance.

64
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:48.809
I'm going to...

65
00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.209
take everything back.

66
00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:53.439
Executive Jung...

67
00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:56.348
will go mad.

68
00:07:56.348 --> 00:07:58.019
(Cheong A Bio)

69
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:06.858
Executive Jung.

70
00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:09.129
It seems like...

71
00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:12.028
you are not as sharp as before in handling businesses.

72
00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.699
I'm talking about Mo Hyun.

73
00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.269
Father.

74
00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:22.238
I was under the impression...

75
00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:26.178
that you took care of the son Soo Man had out of wedlock...

76
00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:30.949
from a long time ago without leaving any trace.

77
00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:39.818
You failed to make her follow her father's footstep.

78
00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:43.089
Boo Cheon is going to be the vice chairman soon.

79
00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.899
The reputation of Boo Cheon has become important.

80
00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:47.229
Yes, Father.

81
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:49.698
Right now, I am helping...

82
00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:53.438
Mo Hyun so that she can conceive...

83
00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.208
Boo Cheon's child.

84
00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:59.308
All right. If she asks for a divorce on the grounds of the affair,

85
00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:01.879
it will greatly mar his reputation.

86
00:09:03.048 --> 00:09:05.149
Try to comfort her.

87
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:12.519
Oh, no! You can't walk in there. Hold on a second.

88
00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:16.058
<v ->My goodness. - I didn't know Mo Hyun was feisty.</v>

89
00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:18.399
Speak of the devil.

90
00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:27.499
Grandfather, there's something I must tell you.

91
00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:32.739
<v ->Eun Shim. - Yes, sir.</v>

92
00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:34.609
I will show myself out.

93
00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:42.318
Okay. What is it that you want to tell me?

94
00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:53.798
How did you know that I like Poet Yoon Dong Ju?

95
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:57.198
I read it on the newspaper before.

96
00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:00.239
<v ->I see. - In my early days,</v>

97
00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:02.438
I liked storybooks,

98
00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:05.308
so I wanted to become a writer.

99
00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:09.078
<v ->I see. - I still have Boo Cheon...</v>

100
00:10:09.448 --> 00:10:12.019
read me books before I go to bed.

101
00:10:12.918 --> 00:10:14.519
Every book has...

102
00:10:15.188 --> 00:10:18.418
its climax and conclusion.

103
00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:21.028
The same thing applies to our lives.

104
00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:23.158
After wandering like duckweed,

105
00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:25.729
it finally reaches its conclusion.

106
00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:29.068
<v ->Mo Hyun, turn this off. - If you put a period at the end...</v>

107
00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:31.139
<v ->What are you doing? - of your life yourself,</v>

108
00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:32.899
<v ->How rude of you. - your name will live in history...</v>

109
00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:35.109
<v ->How dare you? - for leading an independent life...</v>

110
00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:38.908
<v ->without being led by the nose. - Executive Jung.</v>

111
00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.208
Leave it.

112
00:10:40.678 --> 00:10:42.578
<v ->Father. - If you decide...</v>

113
00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.249
to take all the responsibilities...

114
00:10:45.448 --> 00:10:48.548
regarding this complicated matter and depart this life,

115
00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:51.158
as I still have a lot to do in this world,

116
00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:54.759
I'll make sure to take care of...

117
00:10:55.028 --> 00:10:56.589
Mo Hyun and my great grandson.

118
00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:08.568
Playing this recording in front of me...

119
00:11:09.308 --> 00:11:12.979
is the manner your father whom you respect taught you?

120
00:11:14.078 --> 00:11:16.308
Do you think I went to visit your father at the hospital...

121
00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.249
and your father committed suicide...

122
00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:21.318
instead being investigated because we are not...

123
00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:24.048
<v ->as honest as you are? - Grandfather.</v>

124
00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:27.219
I played it because I only wish to know the truth.

125
00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.629
A liar.

126
00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:32.229
You played it to criticize me. How dare you lie to me?

127
00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:37.328
My version of the truth...

128
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:40.038
is in the recording you played.

129
00:11:40.068 --> 00:11:41.509
Your father's version of the truth...

130
00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:44.239
lies in the suicide Congressman Na has chosen.

131
00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:46.178
What more do you want from here?

132
00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:48.678
The truth that made my dad commit the act.

133
00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:51.678
Mo Hyun. Get up right now. Now!

134
00:11:51.719 --> 00:11:54.389
If you're sad about your father's death,

135
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:55.788
mourn his death.

136
00:11:56.188 --> 00:11:59.019
Congressman Na left the will saying he'd take all the responsibilities.

137
00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:00.589
Dishonoring your father's will...

138
00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.989
is the most undutiful act a daughter can commit toward her father.

139
00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:05.729
<v ->Grandfather, I... - Shut your mouth.</v>

140
00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.469
I've lost all my affection towards you.

141
00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:10.269
I don't even want to hear your voice.

142
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:15.509
Executive Jung, from this point on,

143
00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:18.379
Mo Hyun is banned from coming to Mooshimjae.

144
00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:21.208
<v ->Grandfather. - Don't play the recording...</v>

145
00:12:21.578 --> 00:12:23.379
in front of me.

146
00:12:23.778 --> 00:12:25.818
Take and report it to the police.

147
00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:29.219
Get out of my house!

148
00:12:29.318 --> 00:12:30.849
You good-for-nothing witch!

149
00:12:40.428 --> 00:12:43.229
Father, I'm sorry.

150
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:45.269
If you took care of her the other day,

151
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:48.139
this wouldn't have happened.

152
00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.859
What did you have to discuss with Grandfather?

153
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.369
Boo Cheon.

154
00:13:21.408 --> 00:13:23.639
I want to drink it, so I can get some sleep.

155
00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:26.938
<v ->Give it back. - Let me...</v>

156
00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:31.448
Let me tuck you to bed then. Let's go.

157
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:06.719
Mo Hyun.

158
00:14:16.229 --> 00:14:17.428
What's wrong with her?

159
00:14:20.499 --> 00:14:23.469
It seems like she had a drink in the dining room.

160
00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:34.509
The house is restless.

161
00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.979
It's never been this bad before.

162
00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:40.649
Why would you say that?

163
00:14:40.778 --> 00:14:42.288
You're making me nervous.

164
00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:44.759
It seems...

165
00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:48.328
Ms. Na is above average.

166
00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:52.158
Why isn't she getting divorced?

167
00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:56.028
It doesn't look like she's after money.

168
00:14:56.599 --> 00:14:58.068
For the last 30 years,

169
00:14:59.038 --> 00:15:01.139
I've never told anyone about...

170
00:15:02.908 --> 00:15:05.078
what happened in Gapyeong.

171
00:15:06.778 --> 00:15:09.578
Then how does Father know?

172
00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:14.889
Gosh.

173
00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:19.418
Was I fooled by his trick?

174
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:23.058
Anyway,

175
00:15:23.729 --> 00:15:26.198
he's worse than a 1,000-year-old snake.

176
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:31.438
Father...

177
00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.469
hasn't given any directions yet,

178
00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:36.568
but...

179
00:15:37.609 --> 00:15:40.278
if he ever indicates about getting rid of Mo Hyun,

180
00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:43.509
you need to...

181
00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:45.479
get it done right this time.

182
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:46.918
Do you understand?

183
00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:52.359
Father...

184
00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:56.458
has opened up for Boo Cheon for the first time in decades.

185
00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:58.259
If he closes his mind,

186
00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.558
Boo Cheon's out.

187
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:03.499
I...

188
00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:07.168
can't do that anymore, ma'am.

189
00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:13.208
You haven't done anything for Boo Cheon as his father.

190
00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:15.649
If you can't open up a path for him,

191
00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.308
you should get rid of the obstacles at least.

192
00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:26.359
(Mooshimwon)

193
00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:51.678
Mr. Kang.

194
00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:02.328
Mr. Kang.

195
00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:27.178
Did you know...

196
00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:30.849
Honorary Chairman Jang visited Congressman Na before he died?

197
00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:33.289
I'm sorry, ma'am.

198
00:17:33.889 --> 00:17:37.389
It's very sensitive matter. I kept it a secret.

199
00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:41.228
You kept it a secret?

200
00:17:44.468 --> 00:17:45.599
Kang Pil Joo.

201
00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:50.408
Is your skill already rusted, or...

202
00:17:51.639 --> 00:17:53.539
have you gone dull because it's about Mo Hyun?

203
00:17:57.248 --> 00:17:59.248
Mo Hyun played a recording of...

204
00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:01.018
Na Gi Chul and Honorary Chairman Jang's...

205
00:18:01.018 --> 00:18:02.918
conversation in front of him.

206
00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:09.728
Did you say Mo Hyun you and Boo Cheon know...

207
00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.958
and Mo Hyun that I know...

208
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.198
are different?

209
00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:17.428
She's...

210
00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:20.198
boiling water.

211
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.408
We'll end up getting burnt to death...

212
00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:26.609
with boiling water...

213
00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:29.849
because of her.

214
00:18:32.418 --> 00:18:35.849
I'll make sure she'd never do anything that may upset...

215
00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:37.658
Honorary Chairman Jang.

216
00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:40.988
She's already prohibited from entering Mooshimjae.

217
00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:44.359
He's only...

218
00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:48.928
giving her a break for Boo Cheon's reputation.

219
00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:57.139
You know that...

220
00:18:58.579 --> 00:18:59.839
if Honorary Chairman Jang...

221
00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:02.809
becomes furious,

222
00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.379
we'll be all dead.

223
00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:09.649
Cheong A's...

224
00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:13.119
in a good atmosphere with news of a young vice chairman.

225
00:19:14.188 --> 00:19:16.029
If Mo Hyun ruins it...

226
00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:20.059
and bad articles appear, we'll be in trouble.

227
00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:27.668
From now on, you must clamp down on her thoroughly.

228
00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:32.309
I told Ms. Na...

229
00:19:33.408 --> 00:19:35.408
her marriage with Boo Cheon was my idea.

230
00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:38.149
Why did you tell her that all of a sudden?

231
00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:40.218
She wanted to know.

232
00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:42.789
I thought she should.

233
00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:45.918
Is that why...

234
00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:48.658
she drank so much?

235
00:19:56.498 --> 00:19:58.968
Everyone struggled to bring her...

236
00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:02.639
because she didn't want a blind date. What's her problem?

237
00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.339
Is she complaining about her first encounter...

238
00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:07.438
after five years?

239
00:20:09.978 --> 00:20:12.119
If you didn't plan it for her,

240
00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:15.988
she could never have imagined of becoming Cheong A's daughter-in-law.

241
00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:34.569
What were you thinking?

242
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:40.408
What were you thinking when you told Mo Hyun everything?

243
00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.079
Ms. Na...

244
00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.049
knew everything.

245
00:20:46.518 --> 00:20:48.289
I couldn't hide it anymore.

246
00:20:49.418 --> 00:20:50.488
About what?

247
00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:57.329
Did she...

248
00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.829
know...

249
00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:02.228
everything?

250
00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.399
She even knew that your letter...

251
00:21:05.768 --> 00:21:07.198
was fake.

252
00:21:07.738 --> 00:21:08.839
Did she know...

253
00:21:10.408 --> 00:21:12.039
you were the one...

254
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.178
who gave her a piggyback too?

255
00:21:17.849 --> 00:21:18.879
All of it.

256
00:21:24.218 --> 00:21:26.619
I was bored waiting alone. I ordered first.

257
00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:28.529
Wasn't it hard to find this place?

258
00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:31.158
Yes. I've never been here before. I got lost.

259
00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:32.899
I didn't read the GPS correctly.

260
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.168
That's why she wanted to drink.

261
00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:43.869
That's where...

262
00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.609
you followed her after seeing her...

263
00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:49.779
drunk.

264
00:21:56.518 --> 00:21:57.549
Pil Joo.

265
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:02.359
I'm going to start again with her.

266
00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:05.758
Over again.

267
00:22:09.198 --> 00:22:10.299
Purely.

268
00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:15.738
The first meeting where I approached her intentionally...

269
00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:20.178
has always bothered me like a fish bone in my throat.

270
00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:22.978
It's actually good.

271
00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:32.918
Boo Cheon.

272
00:22:35.658 --> 00:22:36.928
Let's just...

273
00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:39.958
respect...

274
00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:41.768
her decision.

275
00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:45.238
We...

276
00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:48.569
only hurt her by approaching her intentionally.

277
00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:51.238
When you say...

278
00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:53.309
you want to start over,

279
00:22:54.849 --> 00:22:56.849
it might pressure her.

280
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:58.248
Did you...

281
00:23:00.678 --> 00:23:02.649
tell her everything...

282
00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:05.789
so that you can be with her later?

283
00:23:07.988 --> 00:23:11.099
If that's what you're after,

284
00:23:11.498 --> 00:23:12.698
you'd better give up now.

285
00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:32.649
Listen to me, you jerk.

286
00:23:32.948 --> 00:23:33.978
Okay?

287
00:23:34.518 --> 00:23:35.688
I'm...

288
00:23:36.849 --> 00:23:37.889
not...

289
00:23:38.658 --> 00:23:40.688
interested in anything else...

290
00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:44.529
but making you the chairman.

291
00:23:47.668 --> 00:23:48.728
Do you understand?

292
00:23:55.539 --> 00:23:57.839
Mo Hyun was dreaming.

293
00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:01.248
She called your name.

294
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:03.208
Pil Joo.

295
00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:07.049
Don't approach her.

296
00:24:09.018 --> 00:24:10.119
Do me a favor.

297
00:24:14.658 --> 00:24:17.258
Even if she calls your name 1,000 times in her sleep,

298
00:24:17.258 --> 00:24:18.658
I'll take care of it.

299
00:24:19.829 --> 00:24:20.829
You...

300
00:24:23.198 --> 00:24:24.639
better stay away.

301
00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:46.518
If I were to express my opinion as a shareholder of Daeil Distribution,

302
00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:48.129
I believe...

303
00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:51.399
we should make the company be listed...

304
00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.928
<v ->even if it costs a lot. - It's been 30 years...</v>

305
00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:57.428
since I inherited Daeil Distribution from my late father.

306
00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:00.268
I believe it should've been listed a long time ago.

307
00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.279
What's the biggest problem now?

308
00:25:05.478 --> 00:25:09.208
The fact that Daeil Distribution grew up...

309
00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:10.879
with jobs given by Cheong A...

310
00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:12.619
is the biggest obstacle.

311
00:25:14.948 --> 00:25:18.089
Of course, it's not against the law,

312
00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:19.819
but if words get out,

313
00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:22.059
it'll harm the reputation of both...

314
00:25:22.228 --> 00:25:23.529
international distribution and domestic delivery service.

315
00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:25.428
We should be careful.

316
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.428
Proceed.

317
00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:31.938
I just made an urgent suggestion.

318
00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:35.339
Daeil Distribution needs to freshen up its reputation...

319
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:38.079
at the same time it is listed.

320
00:25:38.708 --> 00:25:41.748
Honorary Chairman Jang has suggested...

321
00:25:41.948 --> 00:25:44.109
Director Jang Boo Cheon and Executive Jung Mal Ran...

322
00:25:44.178 --> 00:25:46.819
to donate part of their shares as major stockholders...

323
00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:49.649
to socially disadvantaged class.

324
00:25:49.988 --> 00:25:50.988
Hey.

325
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:56.789
Father.

326
00:25:57.899 --> 00:25:59.958
If you told us in advance,

327
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:03.799
we would've come up with the amount carefully.

328
00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:06.998
The chairman's suggesting 500 billion dollars.

329
00:26:10.668 --> 00:26:11.678
Then...

330
00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:16.109
Cheong A Foundation can manage the fund.

331
00:26:16.478 --> 00:26:17.478
Yes, ma'am.

332
00:26:18.478 --> 00:26:22.248
Cheong A Foundation will manage the fund for sure.

333
00:26:25.619 --> 00:26:28.688
Grandfather. I need time to think about it.

334
00:26:28.928 --> 00:26:31.158
Are you saying you won't take my opinion?

335
00:26:31.658 --> 00:26:33.529
I'm a major shareholder of Daeil Distribution.

336
00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:36.698
Because the honorary chairman has invested Cheong A Bio in kind...

337
00:26:36.698 --> 00:26:38.268
for Daeil Distribution shares,

338
00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:40.468
he has a right as a major shareholder.

339
00:26:41.238 --> 00:26:43.869
Of course, you have a right.

340
00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:49.478
Cheong A Foundation will manage the fund, Boo Cheon.

341
00:27:02.158 --> 00:27:03.188
Mom.

342
00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:05.998
Do you think Pil Joo really didn't know...

343
00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:10.829
and suddenly delivered it on behalf of Grandfather?

344
00:27:11.698 --> 00:27:13.039
I do.

345
00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:15.609
Even if...

346
00:27:16.309 --> 00:27:17.978
he knew,

347
00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:21.349
he probably had a reason.

348
00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:25.319
Mom. You trust him so much.

349
00:27:26.379 --> 00:27:28.448
What if he betrays you?

350
00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:31.658
How are you going to handle that?

351
00:27:31.918 --> 00:27:33.289
You think so?

352
00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:36.958
That's unimaginable.

353
00:27:38.158 --> 00:27:39.998
Mom. Pil Joo is...

354
00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:45.599
You...

355
00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:48.738
don't know...

356
00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:50.609
his serious stare.

357
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.208
Those eyes.

358
00:27:54.609 --> 00:27:56.379
They can't possibly betray me.

359
00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:00.678
I may not know anything else,

360
00:28:01.418 --> 00:28:04.018
but I can read him.

361
00:28:05.589 --> 00:28:06.619
Think of it as...

362
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:10.629
he's doing this for you who is his owner.

363
00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:22.908
He'll explain it to you.

364
00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:40.758
Boo Cheon. Executive Jung.

365
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:43.389
I'm sorry...

366
00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:45.899
I couldn't tell you about Daeil Distribution donation in advance.

367
00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:01.948
Does it have to be that big?

368
00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:04.918
I know we must steal the heart of the next president.

369
00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:08.549
We must donate the amount that exceeds people's imagination...

370
00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:10.319
to move their hearts.

371
00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:14.389
This donation will make...

372
00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:16.458
Cheong A's impression good, sir.

373
00:29:18.158 --> 00:29:19.258
Then...

374
00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:22.569
we should discuss it with...

375
00:29:22.829 --> 00:29:24.069
Executive Jung and Boo Cheon.

376
00:29:24.168 --> 00:29:26.069
I think it should be a surprise...

377
00:29:26.168 --> 00:29:27.908
which you enjoy.

378
00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:31.039
If Executive Jung finds out,

379
00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:34.139
she'd want to adjust the amount.

380
00:29:34.448 --> 00:29:36.908
And if Boo Cheon goes against it...

381
00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:39.349
and the press finds out about it,

382
00:29:39.478 --> 00:29:40.819
people will say...

383
00:29:41.418 --> 00:29:44.389
it was a fund raising the government.

384
00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:47.728
Then it will be worse than...

385
00:29:47.988 --> 00:29:50.228
not donating at all, sir.

386
00:30:00.238 --> 00:30:01.539
(Cheong A Foundation Intranet)

387
00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:04.208
(This account does not have an access.)

388
00:30:17.619 --> 00:30:20.789
This is the accounting data you requested.

389
00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:23.589
Yes, Thank you.

390
00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:25.158
Also,

391
00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:29.069
there's accounting data that I can't open in the internal network.

392
00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:30.899
Yes. Actually...

393
00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:34.438
only Executive Jung and Executive Park...

394
00:30:34.468 --> 00:30:36.268
can open it.

395
00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:37.809
It's blocked.

396
00:30:38.738 --> 00:30:39.738
Okay.

397
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:52.518
Mo Hyun. I'm ready.

398
00:30:57.542 --> 00:31:02.542
&lt;font color="#80ffff"&gt;[VIU Ver] E18 Money Flower "Don't Make a Move"&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color="#ff00ff"&gt;-= Ruo Xi =-&lt;/font&gt;

399
00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:09.438
It's the woman...

400
00:31:12.539 --> 00:31:14.649
Boo Cheon met before we got married.

401
00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:19.279
<v ->Her child is five years old. - Stop it.</v>

402
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:24.319
The details are for Boo Cheon.

403
00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:25.819
You don't need to tell me.

404
00:31:28.529 --> 00:31:31.158
Divorce him, and come back home.

405
00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:34.569
I still have energy.

406
00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:38.139
I'll help you to become happier than before...

407
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:39.438
when you come back.

408
00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:41.869
Let it go.

409
00:31:42.069 --> 00:31:44.779
Move on. Don't leave any feelings behind. Come back immediately.

410
00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:47.539
I'm not saying anything...

411
00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:49.908
because you still live there.

412
00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:51.518
There's...

413
00:31:53.718 --> 00:31:55.418
something I must do...

414
00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:00.889
before I divorce him.

415
00:32:04.258 --> 00:32:05.758
Wait for me, Mom.

416
00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:15.268
When I was young,

417
00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:18.879
you were sitting down all exhausted,

418
00:32:19.609 --> 00:32:22.849
so I asked you why you were so exhausted, and you said that...

419
00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:25.718
there was a dream...

420
00:32:25.748 --> 00:32:27.688
you wanted to accomplish desperately.

421
00:32:28.018 --> 00:32:29.389
But you were incompetent and powerless...

422
00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:31.589
to accomplish it.

423
00:32:32.688 --> 00:32:34.119
So you were sad.

424
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:38.228
Your dream will be accomplished now.

425
00:32:38.228 --> 00:32:39.629
Not the money,

426
00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:41.998
but your sincerity...

427
00:32:42.968 --> 00:32:44.539
helped you.

428
00:33:29.349 --> 00:33:30.708
Did you look for me, Mother?

429
00:33:47.869 --> 00:33:49.799
We should settle...

430
00:33:50.968 --> 00:33:52.639
what Grandfather yelled at you for.

431
00:33:55.139 --> 00:33:56.369
Let me ask you one thing.

432
00:33:57.339 --> 00:33:59.339
Why did you take it to Mooshimjae?

433
00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:01.609
This place is connected to my dad.

434
00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:04.879
I wanted to know the truth about Cheong A.

435
00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:08.619
My dad was a righteous and sincere politician all his life.

436
00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:11.219
I needed to know why he received money from Cheong A...

437
00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:14.288
and decided to take his own life.

438
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.129
Why haven't you asked me earlier?

439
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:25.699
He just...

440
00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:28.509
wanted to become president...

441
00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.239
so desperately.

442
00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:34.649
That is the only truth about Congressman Na, Mo Hyun.

443
00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.949
He wanted to satisfy...

444
00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.759
his earnest desire...

445
00:34:48.029 --> 00:34:49.688
and realize his dream.

446
00:34:50.458 --> 00:34:52.558
He was drawn close to Cheong A by fate.

447
00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:54.668
Then he was driven...

448
00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.839
to the corner hopelessly,

449
00:34:58.868 --> 00:35:01.438
so he gave up...

450
00:35:02.708 --> 00:35:04.279
both on his dream and life.

451
00:35:07.808 --> 00:35:08.909
I also...

452
00:35:10.009 --> 00:35:11.248
have earnest desire...

453
00:35:12.078 --> 00:35:15.018
to make Boo Cheon the chairman of Cheong A,

454
00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.518
so I understand Congressman Na.

455
00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:21.359
Should I interpret it this way?

456
00:35:23.188 --> 00:35:25.929
Cheong A could bring him anything...

457
00:35:27.828 --> 00:35:29.868
and make everything possible...

458
00:35:29.899 --> 00:35:31.899
as long as he wanted.

459
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:34.668
So he tried to become president...

460
00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:37.208
with the help of Cheong A.

461
00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:45.279
What did Cheong A earn by giving money to my dad?

462
00:35:50.388 --> 00:35:53.219
I'm sure it didn't give him money...

463
00:35:54.388 --> 00:35:56.359
just to realize his dream.

464
00:35:58.228 --> 00:36:00.359
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.

465
00:36:01.668 --> 00:36:03.799
Pil Joo told me that you set me up...

466
00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:06.938
to meet Boo Cheon according to your plan...

467
00:36:06.938 --> 00:36:08.268
to have my dad as your in-law.

468
00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:11.509
So what?

469
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:13.839
What do you want from me now?

470
00:36:18.819 --> 00:36:20.518
I want some consolation.

471
00:36:24.219 --> 00:36:25.759
How could I console you?

472
00:36:26.319 --> 00:36:28.629
I can't soothe you in my arms like a little baby.

473
00:36:34.529 --> 00:36:35.899
Give me money.

474
00:36:40.768 --> 00:36:43.109
I'll consult my lawyer...

475
00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:46.379
how much I should demand you...

476
00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:48.279
for compensation and let you know.

477
00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:20.578
I was talking about the old days with Dr. Hwang over our cups,

478
00:37:21.609 --> 00:37:23.609
and I suddenly missed you, so I came here.

479
00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:26.719
I'm glad you came here.

480
00:37:27.888 --> 00:37:30.319
Dr. Hwang worked really hard...

481
00:37:30.319 --> 00:37:31.958
to save Attorney Kang.

482
00:37:35.388 --> 00:37:38.929
Dr. Hwang told me how much...

483
00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:42.069
you cared for Attorney Kang,

484
00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:46.069
and it quite broke my heart.

485
00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:50.409
You'd been excessively strict...

486
00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:53.578
to me and my brother.

487
00:38:02.388 --> 00:38:04.759
Your decision to remove the oxygen tank...

488
00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:06.418
from Soo Man was very harsh...

489
00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:10.429
when we still could wait longer for his recovery.

490
00:38:10.429 --> 00:38:12.228
Watching that big man...

491
00:38:12.228 --> 00:38:15.228
subsisting his life on the oxygen tank was terrible.

492
00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:18.038
Actually,

493
00:38:19.138 --> 00:38:21.708
right after you ordered them to remove his oxygen tank,

494
00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:26.038
he showed some progress.

495
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:33.078
But I told the doctor not to tell you...

496
00:38:33.418 --> 00:38:35.888
since the progress was too subtle and meaningless.

497
00:38:39.618 --> 00:38:40.659
Even if...

498
00:38:41.558 --> 00:38:44.929
the progress might have meant nothing to me and you,

499
00:38:46.429 --> 00:38:48.328
Boo Cheon and Mal Ran...

500
00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:52.598
could've seen it as a hope if they knew it.

501
00:38:53.899 --> 00:38:56.308
So I feel quite bad for them.

502
00:38:57.268 --> 00:39:00.578
We shortened the painful time for Soo Man.

503
00:39:00.949 --> 00:39:02.609
We should see it that way.

504
00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:08.348
By the way, is Yeo Cheon doing fine there?

505
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:09.719
He is.

506
00:39:10.188 --> 00:39:13.558
It must be hard for him as he had never faced such hardships,

507
00:39:13.618 --> 00:39:16.228
but he sounds bright and reliable over the phone.

508
00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:24.129
He seems to have grown up.

509
00:39:24.998 --> 00:39:28.739
Why don't you tell him to come back?

510
00:39:28.739 --> 00:39:30.768
He needs to be there for a full year...

511
00:39:31.138 --> 00:39:32.379
so that everyone knows...

512
00:39:32.379 --> 00:39:36.109
that I'm merciless to those who harm Cheong A.

513
00:39:36.848 --> 00:39:38.779
There is no way he comes back already.

514
00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:43.618
Making him leave Cheong A would be better.

515
00:39:44.418 --> 00:39:46.719
It's too harsh...

516
00:39:46.888 --> 00:39:50.058
for such a young man to stay far away.

517
00:39:50.058 --> 00:39:52.199
Punishment must be harsh.

518
00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:56.498
Stop talking nonsense pretending to be drunk, and leave.

519
00:39:56.699 --> 00:39:58.038
I'm tired.

520
00:40:14.788 --> 00:40:16.649
Although it was short, I had a deep sleep.

521
00:40:17.759 --> 00:40:18.958
When did you get here?

522
00:40:23.029 --> 00:40:25.228
I just got here. Were you waiting for me?

523
00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:28.868
Yes, I have something to consult you.

524
00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:33.668
I was recognized to be competent in running business...

525
00:40:33.668 --> 00:40:35.069
when I worked for Cheong A Bio, right?

526
00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:38.538
Right. You did a great job in Cheong A Bio.

527
00:40:38.779 --> 00:40:39.938
You also did your best.

528
00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:41.308
Do you think so?

529
00:40:41.848 --> 00:40:44.549
I need to hold an additional post of the president at Cheong A Bio...

530
00:40:46.049 --> 00:40:48.618
even after I become the vice chairman.

531
00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:52.288
If the current project for...

532
00:40:52.288 --> 00:40:54.529
Alzheimer's new treatment succeeds,

533
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:56.629
it'll change the game for the bio industry internationally.

534
00:40:56.629 --> 00:41:00.529
Then I must stay at Cheong A Bio in order to get credit for it.

535
00:41:00.728 --> 00:41:01.969
That's a good idea.

536
00:41:03.299 --> 00:41:04.768
I knew you'd support it.

537
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:08.509
I need you to give full support for my idea...

538
00:41:08.638 --> 00:41:11.078
at the upcoming directors' meeting.

539
00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:13.208
Sure.

540
00:41:15.978 --> 00:41:16.978
What?

541
00:41:17.819 --> 00:41:19.449
Are you about to say that...

542
00:41:19.879 --> 00:41:23.149
there's nothing more for me to learn from you?

543
00:41:25.819 --> 00:41:26.859
Pil Joo,

544
00:41:27.388 --> 00:41:28.888
I need you to teach me...

545
00:41:29.288 --> 00:41:31.328
how to shoot well like you before you say that.

546
00:41:33.828 --> 00:41:36.429
I went to practice shooting with Secretary Oh recently...

547
00:41:36.668 --> 00:41:38.199
as I thought it was good for concentration.

548
00:41:39.199 --> 00:41:40.268
Would you join us?

549
00:41:41.009 --> 00:41:42.339
Sure.

550
00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:25.308
Such a coward.

551
00:43:28.149 --> 00:43:30.679
It's not loaded.

552
00:43:35.118 --> 00:43:36.118
Let's have a break.

553
00:43:36.118 --> 00:43:37.188
You can have it alone.

554
00:43:38.618 --> 00:43:41.029
I'll practice more while you're gone.

555
00:43:43.029 --> 00:43:45.299
I feel intimidated next to you,

556
00:43:46.429 --> 00:43:48.268
so my shooting is worse than usual.

557
00:44:18.529 --> 00:44:19.529
Secretary Oh.

558
00:44:21.328 --> 00:44:23.268
Please kill Pil Joo for me.

559
00:44:24.098 --> 00:44:25.098
Pardon?

560
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:29.009
I'm kidding.

561
00:44:30.308 --> 00:44:31.808
It's just a joke today,

562
00:44:33.308 --> 00:44:35.308
but you should do it for me...

563
00:44:36.478 --> 00:44:37.779
when I ask you seriously later.

564
00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:43.879
Secretary Oh.

565
00:45:45.319 --> 00:45:46.348
Boo Cheon will soon...

566
00:45:47.348 --> 00:45:49.819
become the vice chairman...

567
00:45:50.149 --> 00:45:51.489
and the chairman.

568
00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:53.359
Before that,

569
00:45:54.728 --> 00:45:56.859
why don't you leave Mooshimwon?

570
00:45:58.629 --> 00:46:00.429
Why should I leave?

571
00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:03.228
It just occurred to me...

572
00:46:03.529 --> 00:46:04.969
when I saw you.

573
00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:07.868
It's for Boo Cheon.

574
00:46:09.569 --> 00:46:11.009
Do you know what my wish is?

575
00:46:14.509 --> 00:46:16.078
I want to live...

576
00:46:18.418 --> 00:46:19.949
just one day longer than Executive Jung.

577
00:46:23.388 --> 00:46:24.819
If I leave Mooshimwon,

578
00:46:26.259 --> 00:46:29.529
I won't be able to know how she's doing.

579
00:46:30.058 --> 00:46:32.199
If Executive Jung dies today,

580
00:46:33.899 --> 00:46:34.969
Mr. Oh Ki Pyung,

581
00:46:35.799 --> 00:46:37.299
you will be dying tomorrow.

582
00:46:39.138 --> 00:46:40.268
Don't you care...

583
00:46:41.308 --> 00:46:42.308
about Boo Cheon?

584
00:46:46.909 --> 00:46:48.009
I can't...

585
00:46:49.279 --> 00:46:51.518
take care of him as a father after all.

586
00:46:58.589 --> 00:47:00.518
What are you guys talking about so seriously?

587
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:09.668
Secretary Oh regrets...

588
00:47:10.629 --> 00:47:12.199
that he's...

589
00:47:13.138 --> 00:47:15.138
growing old single.

590
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:20.509
Why would you regret it?

591
00:47:21.078 --> 00:47:22.978
You can marry a woman now.

592
00:47:24.319 --> 00:47:25.449
It's not too late...

593
00:47:27.989 --> 00:47:29.688
to have a son.

594
00:47:32.788 --> 00:47:36.129
Please don't leave Mooshimwon even if you get married.

595
00:47:38.699 --> 00:47:40.659
Once Mo Hyun and I have children,

596
00:47:41.899 --> 00:47:43.728
you should make wooden horses for them.

597
00:48:39.288 --> 00:48:40.288
Executive Jung.

598
00:48:41.058 --> 00:48:42.529
He's become...

599
00:48:43.159 --> 00:48:45.859
the vice chairman of Cheong A Group as of today.

600
00:48:48.868 --> 00:48:51.199
Mom. I'm Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon...

601
00:48:51.438 --> 00:48:53.239
of Cheong A Group.

602
00:49:03.379 --> 00:49:04.518
Cheong A is...

603
00:49:06.118 --> 00:49:07.748
yours now.

604
00:49:10.219 --> 00:49:11.489
You should love Cheong A...

605
00:49:12.759 --> 00:49:13.759
just like...

606
00:49:14.259 --> 00:49:16.188
Grandfather does.

607
00:49:17.129 --> 00:49:18.129
Okay.

608
00:49:18.799 --> 00:49:22.029
I'll work hard for the interests of Cheong A.

609
00:49:24.638 --> 00:49:26.938
Daeil Distribution will be listed soon.

610
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:30.708
And you're the vice chairman now.

611
00:49:34.449 --> 00:49:36.308
If your father was alive,

612
00:49:37.179 --> 00:49:38.848
he must've been flattered.

613
00:49:41.819 --> 00:49:42.848
I think so too.

614
00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:55.328
Thank you.

615
00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:01.038
Think about how much you want...

616
00:50:01.868 --> 00:50:05.109
for the contingent fee and tell me.

617
00:50:06.138 --> 00:50:07.179
Mom.

618
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:10.578
You should pay him more than what he can imagine.

619
00:50:11.149 --> 00:50:12.618
I promised him.

620
00:50:17.819 --> 00:50:20.719
Pil Joo, I should go to work. I have an appointment.

621
00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:22.159
Okay.

622
00:50:33.998 --> 00:50:36.839
Did you check up on Mo Hyun?

623
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:39.208
Yes. She's working hard...

624
00:50:39.478 --> 00:50:41.078
at the welfare foundation.

625
00:50:41.149 --> 00:50:43.578
She said she'd demand compensation for the arranged marriage,

626
00:50:44.248 --> 00:50:45.719
but I haven't heard from her.

627
00:50:47.379 --> 00:50:50.819
Whatever she does,

628
00:50:52.018 --> 00:50:55.359
she makes me feel nervous.

629
00:51:10.768 --> 00:51:11.909
Hello, Mr. Kim.

630
00:51:13.409 --> 00:51:14.449
Yes.

631
00:51:16.208 --> 00:51:17.679
Yes. I'm leaving now.

632
00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:22.018
Okay.

633
00:51:23.288 --> 00:51:24.288
Bye.

634
00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:48.578
(Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

635
00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:06.859
(Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

636
00:52:07.259 --> 00:52:10.469
Vice Chairman Jang, congratulations on your promotion.

637
00:52:12.598 --> 00:52:13.969
Thank you, Mr. Woo.

638
00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:21.808
Thank you, Pil Joo. Thanks to you,

639
00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:23.509
I could become the vice chairman.

640
00:52:23.978 --> 00:52:25.819
You're ranked in second...

641
00:52:26.978 --> 00:52:28.918
right after Honorary Chairman Jang.

642
00:52:29.449 --> 00:52:32.089
You're the acting chairman and the vice chairman.

643
00:52:41.328 --> 00:52:45.638
Then I will conduct a meeting in the chairman's office...

644
00:52:46.098 --> 00:52:47.498
as the acting chairman.

645
00:52:54.279 --> 00:52:56.348
I will exercise my authority over personnel affairs...

646
00:52:56.708 --> 00:52:58.879
as the vice president who's won the board's approval.

647
00:53:03.688 --> 00:53:04.788
Please come on in.

648
00:53:17.638 --> 00:53:20.638
Congratulations on your promotion, Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon.

649
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:27.978
The first personnel appointment I announced as the vice chairman.

650
00:53:29.208 --> 00:53:30.449
Vice President Jang Yeo Cheon...

651
00:53:31.248 --> 00:53:33.418
is reinstated as the vice president of Cheong A Bio.

652
00:53:44.598 --> 00:53:45.598
Vice Chairman Jang.

653
00:53:46.399 --> 00:53:50.168
You're just like Honorary Chairman Jang who likes surprises.

654
00:53:50.399 --> 00:53:52.569
I probably took it after my grandfather.

655
00:53:54.638 --> 00:53:55.668
Welcome back, Yeo Cheon.

656
00:53:56.739 --> 00:53:59.909
As Grandfather said, I have a lot to defend.

657
00:54:02.308 --> 00:54:05.018
We should work together as a family.

658
00:54:08.248 --> 00:54:09.418
Let's do as you said.

659
00:54:10.848 --> 00:54:12.688
Thank you for not forgetting me.

660
00:54:15.159 --> 00:54:16.989
I was waiting for the day...

661
00:54:17.529 --> 00:54:20.299
to return to Korea at the lumber camp in Myanmar.

662
00:54:28.938 --> 00:54:29.969
Yong Goo,

663
00:54:30.409 --> 00:54:33.478
you still have the recording files from the cameras at the hospital?

664
00:54:33.478 --> 00:54:34.909
Of course.

665
00:54:37.509 --> 00:54:39.518
Do you want to see Mo Hyun visiting you?

666
00:54:39.518 --> 00:54:40.578
No, Boo Cheon.

667
00:54:40.748 --> 00:54:41.848
Boo Cheon?

668
00:54:44.118 --> 00:54:45.759
I didn't pay much attention...

669
00:54:46.219 --> 00:54:47.688
to Boo Cheon.

670
00:55:28.868 --> 00:55:29.929
Boo Cheon...

671
00:55:31.138 --> 00:55:32.739
requested your DNA test?

672
00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:41.078
Becoming the chairman of Cheong A...

673
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:44.819
is neither my mom's dream...

674
00:55:45.348 --> 00:55:47.348
nor your goal anymore.

675
00:55:48.949 --> 00:55:50.248
Now it's my dream...

676
00:55:51.918 --> 00:55:53.089
and my goal.

677
00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:58.129
No matter who it is,

678
00:56:01.699 --> 00:56:03.299
I won't tolerate those...

679
00:56:05.498 --> 00:56:07.069
who get in my way.

680
00:56:39.438 --> 00:56:41.938
It looks the same as your brother's.

681
00:56:42.138 --> 00:56:45.609
This is the necklace my dad gave me.

682
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:48.578
Mo Hyun found it.

683
00:56:52.418 --> 00:56:53.549
I need you to keep it well.

684
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:08.058
What brings you here at this late hour?

685
00:58:11.199 --> 00:58:12.659
<v ->Sir. - I need to talk...</v>

686
00:58:13.399 --> 00:58:15.129
to Chairman Jang urgently.

687
00:58:15.728 --> 00:58:18.199
Please leave us alone.

688
00:58:18.998 --> 00:58:22.308
Gosh. Is it something I'm not supposed to hear?

689
00:58:22.469 --> 00:58:23.569
It is.

690
00:58:42.489 --> 00:58:43.759
Attorney Kang.

691
00:58:44.299 --> 00:58:45.998
What is it at this hour?

692
00:59:29.538 --> 00:59:30.569
Sir.

693
00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:35.208
Do you remember that necklace?

694
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:38.848
It's the necklace...

695
00:59:40.018 --> 00:59:42.049
you gave to...

696
00:59:43.388 --> 00:59:44.719
Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man.

697
00:59:47.989 --> 00:59:50.558
Why do you have it?

698
01:00:13.348 --> 01:00:15.989
I asked why you have it.

699
01:00:45.348 --> 01:00:46.379
Grandfather.

700
01:00:54.058 --> 01:00:55.089
Please allow me to...

701
01:00:56.728 --> 01:00:57.828
make a bow to you...

702
01:01:01.768 --> 01:01:03.029
as your eldest grandson, Eun Cheon.

703
01:02:16.868 --> 01:02:20.138
(Money Flower)
