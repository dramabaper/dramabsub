00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:27.903
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
Take your hands off me. I'm warning you.

3
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.290
Jerk.

4
00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:57.200
- What? - What?

5
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.269
You're a jerk because you put your hands on my face.

6
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.570
It's way too harsh to call me a jerk though.

7
00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:04.870
What are you looking at?

8
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.210
Is it your first time seeing a drunk girl who just got dumped?

9
00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:12.809
"Jerk"?

10
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.950
Oh, I remember you.

11
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.219
Don't you remember me?

12
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.419
I told you not to mess with me.

13
00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:24.760
No. I'm serious.

14
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.090
We've seen each other before.

15
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760
Girls' no does not mean yes.

16
00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.029
When girls say no, it means no. When girls say yes, it means yes.

17
00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:36.600
I don't pretend like I'm innocent.

18
00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:38.339
I never pretend to be naive around men.

19
00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.070
I hate lying or playing innocent.

20
00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.139
If you introduce me to someone different,

21
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.250
I might consider dating her.

22
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.109
You mean like a rude girl?

23
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.919
No, she needs four qualities.

24
00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:53.220
She must not pretend, put on an innocent face, lie.

25
00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.989
"Don't you remember me?"

26
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.160
Do girls still fall for that old pickup line these days?

27
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.329
Too bad.

28
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.630
I'm not interested in you.

29
00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.630
She's not predictable either.

30
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.410
She has the soul that I can fall in love with.

31
00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:22.380
I cannot believe that...

32
00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.149
such woman exists.

33
00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.660
What kind of symptoms do couples have...

34
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.060
who just started falling in love with each other?

35
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.589
When people are in love,

36
00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.369
the neurons in their brains release something called dopamine.

37
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.399
Dopamine?

38
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.940
Dopamine creates...

39
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.910
feelings of happiness and joy.

40
00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.639
It's like an addiction.

41
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.679
Love addiction?

42
00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.679
People say the world looks better when they're in love.

43
00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.450
That's what dopamine does.

44
00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.419
When people are in love, they think they can do anything.

45
00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.359
Motivations and dedications.

46
00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.619
- I love you. - Love and peace.

47
00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.959
- I love you. - They think they can do anything.

48
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.160
The feelings that make people confident to do anything.

49
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.000
- That feelings. - All the best for you guys.

50
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.369
Bye!

51
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.299
But...

52
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.339
it's all useless.

53
00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.839
Dopamine doesn't last long.

54
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.239
It will last for three months the longest.

55
00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.910
By the way,

56
00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.989
it seems like you're forgetting something important.

57
00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.489
What is it?

58
00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.419
Is Ye Ri also interested in you?

59
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.399
I'm not interested in you.

60
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.700
Gosh.

61
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.529
What's that look on your face?

62
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.769
You told her about your feelings.

63
00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:55.510
And you got dumped.

64
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.139
And I'm correct.

65
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.820
(Kim Joo Seung)

66
00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.320
Hey, Eun Ho.

67
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.959
You're coming with me to the meeting in Jeongdongjin this weekend, right?

68
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.130
I'm busy this weekend.

69
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.630
- You said you were free. - No.

70
00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:54.899
I have to study this weekend.

71
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.130
Do you?

72
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.139
What are you doing this weekend, Ye Ri?

73
00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:01.070
I usually go to the library on weekends.

74
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.209
If you need an assistant, I can go with you.

75
00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.880
Hey, you.

76
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.149
Don't you think you should study this weekend?

77
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.420
It's your third time to take SAT. You have to study harder.

78
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.990
I also think you should study harder.

79
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.920
I hope to see you as a freshman next year.

80
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.589
Okay. I will try.

81
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.899
Ye Ri, describe your ideal man, not me.

82
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.099
I was thinking of introducing a guy to you.

83
00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.969
I don't really have one.

84
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.170
I don't like to date people at work.

85
00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.510
Oh, right. I see.

86
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.349
Since it's my third time retaking the SAT exam,

87
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.519
I'm not interested in dating guys at the moment.

88
00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.420
It's a waste of time as I have to study hard for my third SAT exam.

89
00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.060
I have to spend every second of my time on studying...

90
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.399
to get into Eunha University.

91
00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:00.430
My goal is to take your class without feeling guilty.

92
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.670
Good.

93
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.440
- Let's get back to work. - All right.

94
00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.149
Gosh. It's so annoying.

105
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.529
- What's the reason? - Reason for what?

106
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.639
Why are you pushing me away?

107
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.670
Is it because I bothered you and Byung Cheol?

108
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.979
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.279
I now believe what you told me. You have nothing to do with him.

110
00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:01.690
I can find out what you're thinking and I can make you to like me.

111
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.190
Even though I can find out everything,

112
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.320
I won't do that.

113
00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:09.390
It won't be real if I win your heart that way.

114
00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:12.829
Move. Stop bothering me.

115
00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:20.570
- Is it your ex-boyfriend? - No.

116
00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:22.440
Then why are you pushing me away?

117
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.709
I'm not interested in dating guys.

118
00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:28.209
How can you not be interested?

119
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.349
Everybody is interested in dating.

120
00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:32.780
It's not so easy...

121
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.420
for some people.

122
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.509
I want it to end.

"I love you."

127

"I loved you."

128
00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:27.140
"I did it because I was in love."

129
00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:29.810
Those are the stalkers' motivation and excuses.

130
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.910
What are the irrational and anti-social behaviors...

131
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.709
that people do when they are in love?

132
00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:38.150
They...

133
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.020
commit suicide.

134
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.890
Raise your hands if you've ever thought of committing suicide.

135
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.459
- Suicide. - Anyone?

136
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.270
I want it to end.

137
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:08.550
No way.

138
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.979
It's been three years already.

139
00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:14.489
No way.

140
00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:23.900
Hello.

141
00:10:24.259 --> 00:10:27.099
I'm sorry that you had to come all the way here.

142
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.469
I had...

143
00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:32.099
a floral design class.

144
00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:34.270
- Do you even take such class? - Yes.

145
00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:40.509
I feel better when I look at flowers.

146
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.719
The world seems beautiful when I see the flowers.

147
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.489
Right.

148
00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:54.530
My ex-girlfriend lived...

149
00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.099
at flat 301, Chereville.

150
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.859
On that day...

151
00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:02.800
Just before I got mugged,

152
00:11:04.239 --> 00:11:06.640
I saw the guy who lived in flat 302.

153
00:11:10.479 --> 00:11:12.640
Do you remember his face?

154
00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:15.550
I...

155
00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:17.849
don't remember since it's been so long ago.

156
00:11:20.349 --> 00:11:23.890
I'll report that for now, and you'll be asked to come.

157
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.390
Then you have to tell them everything that you remember.

158
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.829
Okay.

159
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.329
- Sir. - Yes?

160
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.430
Don't you think that the guy who mugged me...

161
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.729
is the serial killer?

162
00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:43.709
I could feel that he followed me on purpose.

163
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.209
What if he attacked me...

164
00:11:49.249 --> 00:11:52.280
because I saw his face?

165
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.589
That's possible.

166
00:11:56.219 --> 00:11:58.560
If what you're saying is true,

167
00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:00.829
then you're in trouble.

168
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:02.560
What do you mean?

169
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.099
If he finds out that you're still alive...

170
00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:06.430
And?

171
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.670
- You've got a message. - Gosh.

172
00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:19.009
Sir. I need to check my message.

173
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.349
(Lee Yoo Sik)

174
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.020
Byung Cheol is taking time off from school.

175
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.349
He's taking time off from school?

176
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.820
I should throw these away.

177
00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:37.489
I should end this.

178
00:14:43.219 --> 00:14:44.390
Do you like it?

179
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.390
A French friend of mine recommended me this wine. Do you like it?

180
00:14:47.729 --> 00:14:50.030
It's good. C'est bien.

181
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.729
Is it good?

182
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.599
It's wonderful.

183
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.379
Did you know that...

184
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.579
octopus are very smart?

185
00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:12.119
Octopus is a little less smart than chimpanzees and dolphins.

186
00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:13.619
- Really? - Didn't you know it?

187
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.619
I will tell you then.

188
00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:19.119
Look. Let's say there are three octopuses.

189
00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:20.890
1, 2, 3 octopuses.

190
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.700
Let's say this is a clam. They play soccer with this clam.

191
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.200
They pass the clam to each other.

192
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.469
Like this.

193
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.800
When animals know how to play, it means they are smart.

194
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.339
That's not all.

195
00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:35.339
Let's say they were catching a shrimp.

196
00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:38.709
Hold this shrimp.

197
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.209
Let's say you are the shrimp.

198
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:43.950
And I'm the octopus.

199
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.320
Watch me. You're the shrimp, and I'm the octopus.

200
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.020
The octopus uses its leg to lure the shrimp.

201
00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:53.890
Like this. See? You're already looking at my leg.

202
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:56.859
Then the octopus uses its other legs to catch the shrimp...

203
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:58.930
like this.

204
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.229
She left her work in mid-20s and travelled around the world.

205
00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:05.400
That means she has a strong sense of identity.

206
00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:09.979
She cares more about her feelings than what other people think.

207
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.780
That means...

208
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.579
she might get attracted to a guy...

209
00:16:15.579 --> 00:16:18.150
who is intelligent and funny.

210
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.849
Did you know...

211
00:16:20.349 --> 00:16:22.890
that the aliens were inspired by the shrimps?

212
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.520
Gosh. Really?

213
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.329
- I was only joking. - I know.

214
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.100
Sorry. I hit you so hard.

215
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:36.130
Where are you going?

216
00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:37.799
Kyung Ae, where are you going?

217
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.539
Kyung Ae, where are you going?

218
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:47.650
Gosh.

219
00:16:48.249 --> 00:16:50.880
I was flirting with you the whole time.

220
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.819
But you kept talking about the octopuses.

221
00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:01.630
You said you are a profiler,

222
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.630
but you don't know what girls think.

223
00:17:04.729 --> 00:17:05.959
I'm slow-witted.

224
00:17:12.969 --> 00:17:14.110
Hello.

225
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.009
There's no one.

226
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.209
- Do you want to taste the octopus? - Yes.

227
00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:19.479
This is too big.

228
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.680
- It's okay. - Open your mouth.

229
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.650
You like this?

230
00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:38.200
- You have sauce on your face. - Do I?

231
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.309
Kyung Ae, suck my blood later.

232
00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:55.049
Gosh.

233
00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:02.549
Wait.

234
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.360
- Hey, wait. - Why?

235
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.930
There is an ethnic group called Moso in China.

236
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.360
We can talk about them later.

237
00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:15.469
Kyung Ae, I meant...

238
00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:20.539
Guys from Moso...

239
00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:23.140
never put their women under them.

240
00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:25.410
Matriarch.

241
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.309
Matriarch...

242
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.450
Matriarch...

243
00:18:31.249 --> 00:18:32.549
Kyung Ae.

244
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.049
I should lead you like a man. Well, I don't mind this at all.

245
00:18:38.259 --> 00:18:39.390
Gosh.

246
00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.180
Why is she not answering her phone?

247
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.080
- It's me. - Who is this?

248
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.979
Didn't you save my number?

249
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.989
Never mind.

250
00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.989
- Where are you? Let's meet up. - I'm on my way to the meeting.

251
00:19:09.989 --> 00:19:11.959
What? Why are you going there?

252
00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.860
Never mind. When are you coming back?

253
00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:16.799
- I'm not coming back. - You are not coming back?

254
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.400
Put Mr. Kim on the phone.

255
00:19:20.529 --> 00:19:22.700
Hello? Hello?

256
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.979
The person you're calling is unavailable right now. Please...

257
00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:34.049
Hold on. Where is the meeting being held?

258
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:36.620
Right. It's held in Jeongdongjin.

259
00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:39.519
Let me borrow this.

260
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.450
What's wrong?

261
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.920
What are you searching?

262
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.489
Do you know a place...

263
00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:50.559
where there are wooden stairs to an observatory.

264
00:19:50.729 --> 00:19:54.229
There is a human-like statue.

265
00:19:54.229 --> 00:19:58.539
There is an ocean too. It's a nice place to think of your old partners.

266
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.080
(Jeongdongjin Sunrise Park)

267
00:20:05.979 --> 00:20:08.080
(A cliff in Jeongdongjin Sunrise Park)

268
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.019
Somewhere like this?

269
00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:15.289
Yes. This is it.

270
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.719
Where is this place?

271
00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:18.690
It's an important place...

272
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160
("Two-faced Couple")

273
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.729
that my favorite writer, Sarangbagi, mentions in his book.

274
00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:26.299
The main characters in this book promise each other to go there.

275
00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:28.229
So where is this place?

276
00:20:28.229 --> 00:20:30.469
It's a cliff in Sunrise Park, Jeongdongjin.

277
00:20:30.469 --> 00:20:31.499
What?

278
00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:34.370
Hold on. Let's calm down and think carefully.

279
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.209
This is just a coincidence.

280
00:20:36.209 --> 00:20:39.279
She's with Joo Seung. Nothing will happen.

281
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.680
Hey. Why are you here?

282
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.749
This is my house. What more reason do I need?

283
00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:53.029
I thought you were going to the meeting in Jeongdongjin.

284
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:55.660
Something has suddenly come up. I couldn't make it today.

285
00:20:56.499 --> 00:20:59.569
They only needed my documents. I asked Ye Ri to take them.

286
00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.600
Why did you ask her to do it?

287
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.400
Because she told me she needs to go to Jeongdongjin anyway.

288
00:21:04.499 --> 00:21:07.569
I don't know why I have to explain all this to you.

289
00:21:07.569 --> 00:21:08.640
I knew it.

290
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.779
He's crazy.

291
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.019
He's crazy. You should stop liking him.

292
00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:19.549
No way.

293
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:24.819
Taxi! Taxi!

294
00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:31.029
Taxi. Taxi.

295

Hello. Are you going somewhere?

303
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.549
What is she thinking?

304
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:57.549
No. She shouldn't do something stupid.

305
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:58.719
(Jeongdongjin)

306
00:23:53.769 --> 00:23:55.539
Hey.

307
00:23:56.979 --> 00:23:59.009
Let's take a photo together.

308
00:23:59.009 --> 00:24:01.009
I don't like getting photographed.

309
00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:10.559
- Do I look good in the photos? - Yes.

310
00:24:13.459 --> 00:24:15.489
I love the smell of the ocean.

311
00:24:17.729 --> 00:24:20.200
Let's come here again next year.

312
00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:22.170
Sure. Let's do that.

313
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.209
I will be a university student by then.

314
00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:32.239
And you will be a famous writer after winning in a contest.

315
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.249
You should not leave me when you become famous.

316
00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:45.160
- Ye Ri. - Yes?

317
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:48.160
Can you be on my side...

318
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.499
no matter what?

319
00:24:50.499 --> 00:24:51.860
Of course.

320
00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:54.999
I will always be on your side.

321
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.039
We will be together until the end, right?

322
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.749
Of course. I will always be next to you.

323
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.309
Just like how you are next to me.

324
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.660

How could you think of killing yourself?

341

Let go of me first.

342

I won't let go. Never.

Do you think he will care if you do this?

It's your loss if you kill yourself.

00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:18.860
You should meet someone better than him and live happily.

That's how you can take a revenge on him.

What?

354
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.310
Are you not committing suicide?

00:38:05.669 --> 00:38:08.740
It happened all the time, so people started thinking she's the bad luck.

502
00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:10.169
That's what everyone thought.

503
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.010
Then she left the school.

504
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.650
I'm not interested in dating guys.

505
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.079
It's not so easy...

506
00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:21.849
for some people.

507
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:25.389
You were too scared to ask her out.

508
00:38:25.389 --> 00:38:27.019
Such a coward.

509
00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:30.059
You were so excited to see her earlier...

510
00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:32.630
as it's been four years since you saw her.

511
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:34.099
Guys.

512
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.930
Why did you guys run after her?

513
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:39.269
We were just happy to see her.

514
00:38:39.269 --> 00:38:42.110
Ye Ri is so good at running though.

515
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.780
Anyway, just take care of yourself.

516
00:38:45.939 --> 00:38:48.180
Exercise hard like me.

517
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:51.650
Whatever.

518
00:39:28.249 --> 00:39:29.619
Oh gosh.

519
00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:33.320
Are you okay?

520
00:39:50.369 --> 00:39:51.979
Oh no. I have to go back to Ye Ri.

521
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.019
Take your cellphone charger with you.

522
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.889
You don't know what will happen.

523
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.059
Are you okay?

524
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.789
Yes.

525
00:40:09.729 --> 00:40:11.459
I heard everything from them.

526
00:40:12.099 --> 00:40:13.130
What do you mean?

527
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.800
The reasons you don't want to date.

528
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.340
What did they tell you?

529
00:40:20.439 --> 00:40:23.610
They said bad things happened to people you cared about.

530
00:40:24.539 --> 00:40:26.479
It's like a jinx.

531
00:40:32.019 --> 00:40:33.780
I won't get hurt for sure.

532
00:40:37.889 --> 00:40:39.019
Will you be my girlfriend?

533
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.530
In 1, 2, 3.

534
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760
Look.

535
00:40:47.499 --> 00:40:48.800
Nothing happened.

536
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.400
Nothing will happen even if you start liking me.

537
00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.539
I will break the jinx for you.

538
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.479
So...

539
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.349
you don't need to get scared to come into my heart.

540
00:41:09.189 --> 00:41:10.249
I like you.

541
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:12.789
I like you, Ye Ri.

542
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.369
I can promise you.

543
00:41:24.329 --> 00:41:25.800
I won't get hurt...

544
00:41:26.269 --> 00:41:27.840
from liking you.

545
00:41:29.269 --> 00:41:30.470
Someone said this.

546
00:41:31.139 --> 00:41:34.340
"It's a miracle to like somebody."

547
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.150
It's a miracle...

548
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.150
to like somebody.

549
00:41:40.419 --> 00:41:43.019
"It's right to like somebody..."

550
00:41:43.189 --> 00:41:47.119
"with everything you have."

551
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:51.289
It's right to...

552
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.160
like somebody...

553
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.729
with everything you have.

554
00:41:57.729 --> 00:41:58.970
I'm willing to do it...

555
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.269
because it's a miracle.

556
00:42:10.809 --> 00:42:12.019
It's beautiful.

557
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.970
Let's go.

558
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.999
I'm so happy.

559
00:42:32.999 --> 00:42:34.769
I'm so happy.

560
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.880
I'm really happy.

561
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.309
I'm really happy.

562
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.760
Nothing will happen even if you start liking me.

563
00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.229
I will break the jinx for you.

564
00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:56.860
So...

565
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.229
you don't need to get scared to come into my heart.

566
00:43:05.939 --> 00:43:08.910
- Why don't you just tell him? - What?

567
00:43:09.039 --> 00:43:10.709
I'm talking about this.

568
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.479
The evil side of you.

569
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:17.450
How? “There is a different side of me."

570
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.919
"Can you be careful in crowded places?"

571
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.349
Like this?

572
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.490
You are not taking this seriously.

573
00:43:27.919 --> 00:43:30.860
You said you are sick of getting fired from your part-time jobs.

574
00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:33.260
You also had to change your cram schools so many times.

575
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.130
There aren't any cram schools that you can go to now.

576
00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:42.610
It will be better if you tell him about it before he finds out.

577
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:46.039
You will be able to stop yourself as well.

578
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:47.610
Don't you agree?

579
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:55.050
I'm so happy.

580
00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:56.519
There's something I want to tell you.

581
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.490
- Sorry? - I have to tell you something.

582
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.889
I can't really hear you because of the wind.

583
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:05.430
There's something I need to tell you.

584
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:06.729
What are you saying?

585
00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:32.220
Watch out!

586
00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:39.160
- Are you okay? - Yes.

587
00:44:42.669 --> 00:44:43.869
What?

588
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.269
What's wrong?

589
00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:49.240
- Why is it not working? - What's going on?

590
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.639
The brake isn't working.

591
00:44:52.639 --> 00:44:55.010
- What do we do? - Let's jump on the count of three.

592
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.010
What?

593
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.849
It's going to be okay. In 1, 2, 3!

594
00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.209
Who are you?

595
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:28.709
You are the serial killer.

596
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:30.450
Right?

597
00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:00.139
(Meloholic)

598
00:46:00.139 --> 00:46:01.950
You like Eun Ho so much.

599
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:06.150
He's bleeding. Call an ambulance.

600
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.280
You care so much about this case.

601
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.550
She was my sister.

602
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:12.419
Someone removed the nut on purpose.

603
00:46:12.419 --> 00:46:14.459
Why would someone do such thing?

604
00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:17.490
Keep this on your neck all the time. It will protect you.

605
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.430
I hope time would stop.

606
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.499
How can I tell him about crazy side of me?

607
00:46:23.499 --> 00:46:26.240
I can finally feel that we're dating.

608
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.410
We don't need to talk to communicate.

609
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.309
I wish the time could just stop...

610
00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:34.840
so that I could look at you forever like this.
