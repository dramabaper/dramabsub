1
00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:07.189
(Last week)

2
00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:11.659
(Film a new TV rating notice for the new year, 2018!)

3
00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.659
(The winner will have the chance to direct the TV rating notice.)

4
00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.730
(The new TV rating notice, which will air for a month,)

5
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.239
(was at stake for the last week's dirty and cruel race.)

6
00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.340
(In the midst of tricks, some succeeded and some failed.)

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.610
(They obtained R Ddakjis depending on the results of the race.)

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.149
(And)

9
00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:34.179
(The final round will depend on the R Ddakjis they have obtained.)

10
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.380
(It's their last chance to be the director of TV rating notice.)

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.650
(Which member will be in the limelight of the TV rating notice?)

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.789
(Storyboards of each member)

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.190
(The last mission will determine the director of TV rating notice.)

14
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.429
- What is this? - What's all this?

15
00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:49.060
Do we need to bet again?

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.400
Is this what we're doing today?

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.499
(The set is quite cutting edge.)

18
00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:52.929
- What's happening today? - My gosh.

19
00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:54.239
This looks so cool.

20
00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:56.169
The set looks fancy.

21
00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:57.239
(Which member will win the notice?)

22
00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.870
Did you guys know this about So Min?

23
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.880
She told me that when she was either in high school or college,

24
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.779
she always sang this specific song when her time was up.

25
00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:06.950
My parents are really strict.

26
00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.919
I couldn't stay out late. I had to go home when it was midnight.

27
00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:12.689
I always sang this song when I was leaving the karaoke.

28
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.790
Which song? Sing the chorus.

29
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.290
("Good Time" by Cleo)

30
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.799
(I want to spend the night, but I need my parents' permission)

31
00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.370
- You must've been with a guy. - So...

32
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.740
- She was with a guy back then. - That's why...

33
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.969
- I hated that she sang that song. - She sang it for the guy.

34
00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.510
- She must've sounded cute though. - That sounds about right.

35
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.969
The guy must have enjoyed it though.

36
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.609
- She was singing it for him. - She only picked songs like that.

37
00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.379
- Gosh. You know what I mean? - It is annoying.

38
00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:39.409
"Blue Rain".

39
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.579
Where are Seok Jin and Jong Kook?

40
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.450
Right now, Seok Jin and Jong Kook...

41
00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:47.290
are on their way here. The previous mission took longer than expected.

42
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.990
- It's rush hour now. - I know.

43
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.960
Se Chan must film another show, so we must wrap up by seven here.

44
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
That means all three of them are out of the race.

45
00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.669
Including me?

46
00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:00.700
- You must go film the show. - I can participate longer.

47
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700
You have to go.

48
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.370
So for the following mission, Seok Jin and Jong Kook will...

49
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.070
bet through the phone remotely.

50
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.480
- Are you serious? - Yes.

51
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.680
- Wait. - Cutting edge of the 21st century.

52
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.449
- This is so funny. - The show of the 21st century.

53
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.449
- When we start the game, - Okay.

54
00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.719
- you will participate remotely. - I got it.

55
00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.990
- Okay. - Okay.

56
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.090
Actually, we have to be there to feel the moment.

57
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390
- That's right. - That's kind of disappointing.

58
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.460
(What is the final mission?)

59
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.759
You can acquire R Ddakjis as many as you bet.

60
00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.729
It's a 4-on-4 mission, Along with Mistrust.

61
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:32.999
(Betting mission, Along with Mistrust)

62
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.900
- It's a team match. - It's 4-on-4.

63
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.900
Teach me how to play.

64
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.640
There will be four rounds.

65
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.379
Come up with a list of players after reading keywords for each round.

66
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.210
Bet on your team's victory or loss for each game without disclosing it.

67
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.779
If you win the bet, you will acquire the number of ddakjis you've bet.

68
00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.620
If you lose, you will forfeit the number of ddakjis you've bet.

69
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.390
(They will either win or lose ddakjis.)

70
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.289
However, if you bet on your team's victory,

71
00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.289
and your team does win the game,

72
00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:03.229
then you will be given double the number of ddakjis you've bet.

73
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.729
- Double? That's a lot. - On our team?

74
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.340
- I'm going to bet all in. - Me too, Jae Seok.

75
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.640
- Let's go with Team Nevis. - Yes, let's do that.

76
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.870
- Take Team Australia or... - We'll go with Team New Zealand.

77
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.740
- Is that what you want? - Our pride is at stake then.

78
00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.610
- I'm going to take this seriously. - Fine. Okay.

79
00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.710
(Keywords are quiz, draw of luck, 1-on-1 match, and challenge.)

80
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.719
We must win this round.

81
00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.080
- That's right. We came this far. - Here...

82
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.090
- You should come this way. - My gosh, I'm so exhausted.

83
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390
You know what's at stake on this round, right?

84
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.890
(Everyone, you'd better get ready.)

85
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.390
- Of course. - Five seconds.

86
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.590
- Right. - Five seconds for the notice.

87
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.659
(The winner will be the director.)

88
00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.460
I won't be able to win. I don't have a lot.

89
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.599
All right, everyone. The first game is...

90
00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.069
- a quiz. - Okay.

91
00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:43.640
Jae Seok and Haha. Please come up to the front.

92
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.210
My gosh, in this team, I'm the smart one.

93
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.779
He's the smartest one in our team.

94
00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.379
- That's why we feel so sad. - My gosh.

95
00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.550
- I can't do it. - This is unbelievable.

96
00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:55.379
Well, this might not test us about our common knowledge.

97
00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.779
I might be able to win.

98
00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.189
- That's true. - We don't know what it's about.

99
00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.390
We are going to start now.

100
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.990
- Whoever solves 2 questions 1st... - Is it over then?

101
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.990
- will win. - Should we bet first?

102
00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:09.099
Now, you will place your bets.

103
00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.099
(The betting begins!)

104
00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.330
(They must bet on their member's victory or loss.)

105
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.599
(They will win the same number ddakjis they bet.)

106
00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.509
(If they bet on the victory and win, they will earn double the amount.)

107
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.639
I have to be smart about this. It's an individual match in the end.

108
00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.509
- It's an individual match. - My gosh.

109
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.249
Do you have 20? How many do you have?

110
00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.480
- I have 38. - Write the number of ddakjis.

111
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.720
(Currently, So Min and Kwang Soo are in 3rd and 4th place.)

112
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.550
- Jae Seok is going to do well. - If I win...

113
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.589
- I bet he's going to win. - This game...

114
00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:35.689
(Contemplating)

115
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.290
I think Jae Seok is going to win.

116
00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:40.730
What? Why are you betting so many?

117
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.060
I have to beat you.

118
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.370
(Is that how you're going to play?)

119
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.870
(Thinking)

120
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.240
If I bet on my loss...

121
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240
(I must win the bet.)

122
00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.939
The first game is a quiz.

123
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.280
- Quiz. - Which members are playing?

124
00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.079
- Jae Seok from Team Australia. - Okay.

125
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.879
Haha from Team New Zealand.

126
00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.350
(It's almost like David versus Goliath.)

127
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.990
Jae Seok will win if this is a quiz.

128
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.589
It's the same chance that I win rock-paper-scissors 10 times...

129
00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:11.790
- in a row against you. - That's right.

130
00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.100
- Cover your bet. Don't change it. - Okay.

131
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.160
(8 of them finish betting.)

132
00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:19.999
I will give you the first question.

133
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.569
It's an open-ended question.

134
00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.170
- On archery targets, what is... - This is really hard.

135
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.780
the color of the spot for 10 points, the highest points a player can win?

136
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.709
(What's the color of the spot for 10 points in archery?)

137
00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:33.280
I know the answer, but I'll keep quiet.

138
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.980
- Jae Seok knows a lot about sports. - Yes, he does.

139
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.819
- Try to think it over. - Isn't this too easy?

140
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.749
Really, Haha? Do you know the answer?

141
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.790
This is too easy. Everyone knows unless you're an idiot.

142
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:44.290
Exactly. This is too easy.

143
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.300
All right. Show your answers. 1, 2, 3.

144
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.600
(What are their answers?)

145
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.970
Which color did you write?

146
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.170
(Jae Seok wrote, "yellow", and Haha wrote, "cobalt blue".)

147
00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.839
My gosh, "cobalt blue"?

148
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.740
(I know where he's going with this. He has bet on his loss.)

149
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.540
- What? - This is wrong?

150
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.709
What are you talking about? Why would you write, "cobalt blue"?

151
00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:04.709
The answer is...

152
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.550
The answer is...

153
00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.550
- yellow. - That's right.

154
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.149
How could you get this wrong?

155
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.389
(Kwang Soo and So Min are cheering.)

156
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.720
(But they are happy too?)

157
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.389
- Isn't this too easy? - I knew it.

158
00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.160
- Jae Seok. Please! - Please!

159
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.100
We'll present you the next question.

160
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.629
When someone disturbs or gets in the way of something...

161
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.999
that seems promising or has potential to be successful,

162
00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.300
we say that he or she is "spoiling" the situation.

163
00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.810
From what is the term derived?

164
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.680
My gosh, it's so hard.

165
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.740
(From what is the term, "spoil" derived?)

166
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.910
It's vinegar.

167
00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.249
It's not a candle. It's not, right?

168
00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.019
A long time ago, I knew...

169
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.949
(From what is the term, "spoil" derived?)

170
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.249
(On the other hand, Haha writes his answer with confidence.)

171
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.019
I learned this before.

172
00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:49.290
This is crazy.

173
00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:50.689
I knew it, but I can't remember it now.

174
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:51.889
No, Jae Seok. You must remember it.

175
00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.589
- I can't remember this. - Show your answers.

176
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.259
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3.

177
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.699
I can't remember this.

178
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.600
No way. Did I say the right answer?

179
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.530
- I saw this somewhere. - Jae Seok...

180
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.740
wrote, "vinegar" for his answer.

181
00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:04.269
Are you sure you don't remember?

182
00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:06.170
(My gosh! He wrote, "vinegar"!)

183
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.709
- I can't remember it. - Haha wrote, "My gosh, it's crazy."

184
00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:12.579
(My gosh, it's crazy.)

185
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.579
Haha wrote, "My gosh, it's crazy."

186
00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:16.519
(Look at that guy. That guy is crazy indeed.)

187
00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.019
- Oh, this is crazy - Oh, my.

188
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.920
I learned this a long time ago, but it was such a long time ago.

189
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.759
The term, "spoil" derives from...

190
00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.199
(If vinegar is correct, the 1st round is over with Jae Seok's win.)

191
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:34.870
(In that case, his teammates can obtain double what they have bet.)

192
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.069
The term, "spoil" derives from...

193
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.740
vinegar.

194
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.780
(Vinegar is correct.)

195
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.379
(It derives from vinegar as too much vinegar can spoil the food.)

196
00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:48.420
Jae Seok.

197
00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.749
- Yu Jae Seok! - Yu Jae Seok!

198
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.889
Yu Jae Seok!

199
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.889
(Wait. The word really derives from "vinegar"?)

200
00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:56.889
- Jae Seok. - My gosh.

201
00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.389
What a bummer. I should've bet more.

202
00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:01.560
You're so smart, Jae Seok. How did you know that?

203
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.899
He has never let me down! Never!

204
00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:05.269
My gosh, Jae Seok is so cool.

205
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.430
1, 2, 3. Show us your bets.

206
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.639
I bet five on my winning.

207
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.540
(Jae Seok bet 5, and Haha bet 20.)

208
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.569
- Jae Seok, you'll receive 10. - My gosh.

209
00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:14.280
(10 R Ddakjis go to Jae Seok.)

210
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.540
- You bet 23, right? - Yes.

211
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.639
46 R Ddakjis go to Kwang Soo.

212
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.310
42 R Ddakjis go to So Min.

213
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.449
- I also guessed correctly. - How many R Ddakjis did you bet?

214
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.879
- 20. - 20.

215
00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:24.220
Since your guess is correct, you get 20 R Ddakjis.

216
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:26.720
Se Chan gets four R Ddakjis. Ji Hyo, how many did you bet?

217
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.360
- 3. - You get 3 R Ddakjis.

218
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.730
Jae Seok wins the first round.

219
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.089
(Meanwhile, at the site of the remote betting...)

220
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.959
Both of you won R Ddakjis.

221
00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.630
- I should have bet 20. - I get 20 R Ddakjis.

222
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.000
I didn't occur to me sooner.

223
00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:40.569
It's hard to stay updated at a distance.

224
00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:41.599
(Jong Kook gets 10 R Ddakjis and Seok Jin gets 20 R Ddakjis.)

225
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.540
(The current rankings: Seok Jin, Jong Kook, So Min,)

226
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.270
(Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, Haha, Jae Seok, Se Chan)

227
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.040
(The current rankings: Kwang Soo, So Min, Seok Jin,)

228
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.810
(Jong Kook, Haha, Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

229
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.109
With 81 R Ddakjis, Kwang Soo is leading.

230
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.550
He has one more R Ddakji than So Min.

231
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.280
What was the title of your storyboard?

232
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.859
("2018 Start Afresh", directed by Kwang Soo)

233
00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:04.930
(The members get water bombed in 8 provinces of Korea.)

234
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.890
We can't let that happen.

235
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.099
- We must stop him. - We must stop Kwang Soo.

236
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.900
So Min's "Running Man's Sea Story" is close behind.

237
00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:15.270
("Running Man's Sea Story", directed by So Min)

238
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.099
(The members star in her show as fish, seaweed, rock, etc.)

239
00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:18.709
That's dangerous.

240
00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:21.380
My storyboard is good.

241
00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:23.540
The next mission is a game of chance.

242
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.410
The representatives are So Min and Ji Hyo.

243
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.979
You choose between odd and even.

244
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.349
I will go all in. I have no other choice.

245
00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:31.290
- Odd or even? - Odd.

246
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.489
Please let it be even.

247
00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.489
It's even.

248
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:34.660
(So Min wins.)

249
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.689
(Jae Seok hits the jackpot.)

250
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.890
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" is in first place.

251
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.329
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

252
00:09:41.729 --> 00:09:45.469
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" is in first place.

253
00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:47.939
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals", directed by Jae Seok)

254
00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:49.640
(Other members play various animals in humiliating costumes...)

255
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.069
(and make Jae Seok shine.)

256
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.410
It's the worst!

257
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.810
Please.

258
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.479
We need to stop Jae Seok.

259
00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:57.780
I am in second place.

260
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.510
(Haha's "Man out of a Comic Book" is in 2nd place.)

261
00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:00.680
I could still win.

262
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.319
- It's still in the top three. - You need to win.

263
00:10:02.319 --> 00:10:03.420
- Let's go. - Okay.

264
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.619
You need to win no matter what.

265
00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:06.250
- You can win, right? - This is my last chance.

266
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.489
- I only have one R Ddakji. - Me, too.

267
00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:10.760
- Do you have one R Ddakji? - Yes, I do.

268
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.829
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan end up losing everything.)

269
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:14.430
Ji Hyo and I are the same.

270
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.199
This mission is a 1-on-1 match.

271
00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.229
Before that, Jong Kook and Seok Jin will join...

272
00:10:19.229 --> 00:10:21.040
- since they have arrived. - Welcome.

273
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.739
Did you win?

274
00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:25.640
I bet 20 R Ddakjis on you losing.

275
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.010
The two of you fell far in the rankings.

276
00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:30.739
- Doing it from a distance... - It made you lose your touch.

277
00:10:30.739 --> 00:10:32.109
- It made me lose my touch. - Of course it did.

278
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.750
In this 1-on-1 mission,

279
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.949
you will kick trays with your feet.

280
00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:39.849
Jump high and kick both trays with your feet spread apart.

281
00:10:39.849 --> 00:10:42.660
The one who kicks the trays higher wins.

282
00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:45.760
(Kwang Soo versus Se Chan)

283
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.290
He has long legs.

284
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:49.300
Kwang Soo, show us a kick.

285
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.170
Show us a kick.

286
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.969
- I am much taller than him. - That's right.

287
00:10:53.229 --> 00:10:54.640
I can just raise my legs and touch the trays.

288
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:58.010
Kwang Soo could fail on purpose.

289
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.140
You know,

290
00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:02.479
I can't trust Kwang Soo.

291
00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:04.810
What is he writing? What are you writing?

292
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.510
I can't trust Kwang Soo.

293
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.780
Kwang Soo, you will do your best, right?

294
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.579
Of course. I have to win.

295
00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:11.890
- If I win, I get twice the amount. - That's right.

296
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.250
I will bet on Kwang Soo's win.

297
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.060
- He gets twice the amount that way. - Kwang Soo. What did you write?

298
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.260
Is it win or lose?

299
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.630
I have to bet on winning.

300
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.630
- Tell us. - I have to bet on winning.

301
00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:21.030
- Look me in the eye. - His pants...

302
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.359
- are too thick. - Is it win or lose?

303
00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:24.400
(They are, right?)

304
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.430
Kwang Soo.

305
00:11:26.199 --> 00:11:28.099
Play with your underwear on.

306
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.339
I can't trust him.

307
00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:31.810
(He takes off his pants.)

308
00:11:31.969 --> 00:11:33.770
He has a point.

309
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.280
(He takes off his pants in front of the camera.)

310
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.609
He needs to win to get twice the R Ddakjis he bet.

311
00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:40.150
(I love your passion, Kwang Soo.)

312
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.780
Kwang Soo, you are working hard.

313
00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:44.489
Kwang Soo, you are working hard.

314
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.420
Now, the staff members...

315
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.890
are unfazed.

316
00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:50.319
He is like a grandpa.

317
00:11:50.319 --> 00:11:51.430
(It comes very normally now.)

318
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.660
Please place a bet.

319
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.599
Bet your R Ddakjis on whether or not your team will win.

320
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.069
(I have to win.)

321
00:11:58.069 --> 00:12:01.170
We have to take this to the end.

322
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.270
(Jumping)

323
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.670
- His jump was low. - He can't jump.

324
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.739
- His jump was low. - He can't jump.

325
00:12:05.739 --> 00:12:07.810
(His lousy jump makes people change their bets.)

326
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.709
- His jump was low. - He is stiff.

327
00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:10.849
He is stiff.

328
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.709
(It's a practice.)

329
00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:13.780
He is stiff.

330
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.119
This isn't an easy task.

331
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:16.420
Se Chan.

332
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.119
Try jumping.

333
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.790
- How? - Jump with your feet apart.

334
00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:22.719
(He is far below the trays.)

335
00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:24.160
His jump was lower.

336
00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:26.489
- Seok Jin. - I will bet on Kwang Soo.

337
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.829
- Don't be fooled. - I will bet on Kwang Soo.

338
00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:30.530
- May I practice once? - No.

339
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.069
Can I practice? Do I have to go right away?

340
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.000
I want to do it without the trays over here.

341
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.369
- I will face this way. - Try it.

342
00:12:39.369 --> 00:12:40.810
(Panting)

343
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.209
Kwang Soo wants to win.

344
00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:44.140
Does it hurt?

345
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.310
(Sniffling)

346
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.579
- This is... - Kwang Soo.

347
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.180
- What? - You fell on the floor.

348
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.290
(You are in pain, right?)

349
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.760
(Grunting)

350
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.790
(He pushed the mat and fell on the floor.)

351
00:13:01.729 --> 00:13:04.030
(I landed on my back onto the floor, right?)

352
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.400
Don't you feel a nosebleed coming?

353
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.000
- I can't breathe. - You must be in pain.

354
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.140
He can't breathe.

355
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.000
Why did I fall on the floor?

356
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.540
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

357
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.239
- What? - You fell on the floor.

358
00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:15.479
(Get it together, Kwang Soo.)

359
00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:17.439
- You fool. - Don't you feel a nosebleed coming?

360
00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:19.979
- Don't you taste blood? - You are fine.

361
00:13:19.979 --> 00:13:21.880
(The match begins in earnest.)

362
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.119
- Let's go. - Is Se Chan going first?

363
00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:25.920
- Yes, I am going first. - Please flip over the board.

364
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.349
- This is hard. - This is hard.

365
00:13:27.489 --> 00:13:28.560
Here I go.

366
00:13:30.219 --> 00:13:31.390
We will have a few rounds.

367
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.699
(Since he has no chance of placing 1st,)

368
00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:37.670
(Se Chan has no reason to lose on purpose.)

369
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.400
(Can Se Chan succeed in the 1st round?)

370
00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:44.540
He failed. He failed.

371
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.079
(He jumped pretty high,)

372
00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:50.609
(but his left foot didn't touch the tray.)

373
00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:56.250
- He failed. He failed. - He failed.

374
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.890
Kwang Soo, you will win if you succeed.

375
00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:01.790
- It won't be easy for Kwang Soo. - Didn't my feet touch the trays?

376
00:14:01.989 --> 00:14:03.560
- Good luck. - If I fall backwards as I kick...

377
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.890
- I will succeed if I do that. - You will succeed.

378
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.000
- You can do it, Kwang Soo. - You can do it.

379
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.599
You can do it.

380
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.199
Here I go.

381
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.030
He is going to fail.

382
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.069
No, he wants to do well.

383
00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:18.310
Do it seriously.

384
00:14:18.469 --> 00:14:21.079
(The fate of this round depends on Kwang Soo.)

385
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.140
(Can Kwang Soo succeed?)

386
00:14:25.849 --> 00:14:27.819
(Kwang Soo does it again.)

387
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.650
(He jumps slightly, so he won't touch it.)

388
00:14:31.219 --> 00:14:32.550
He failed.

389
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:35.790
I can't believe him!

390
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.859
It could be a part of his plan.

391
00:14:38.859 --> 00:14:40.290
It's not easy...

392
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.859
- to kick the trays with both feet. - That's not the case.

393
00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:43.329
He must have bet on losing.

394
00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:45.800
- It's neither win nor lose. - Both of them lost.

395
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.430
- They did, right? - It's a failure.

396
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:50.339
- It's neither win nor lose. - Both of them lost.

397
00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:52.040
- They did, right? - It's a failure.

398
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.339
In this case,

399
00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:54.880
there is neither a winner nor a loser.

400
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.380
(Now, there is neither a winner nor a loser.)

401
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.550
Is that the case?

402
00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:02.319
Kwang Soo...

403
00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:05.349
bet everything on losing.

404
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.420
I will take the number of R Ddakjis...

405
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.859
everyone bet.

406
00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:10.219
Are you taking it from all of us?

407
00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:11.930
Yes, I am.

408
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.530
- Thank goodness I bet 5. - I also bet 5.

409
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.530
Thank goodness. I bet one.

410
00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:19.530
I bet one.

411
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.400
Will you take it from all of us?

412
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.500
(Is that how the rules work?)

413
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.770
How many did Kwang Soo bet?

414
00:15:23.969 --> 00:15:25.670
Did you bet on winning or losing?

415
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.369
- I bet on losing. - Show us your board.

416
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.579
- I bet on losing. - What did you write?

417
00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:30.780
- I took off my pants... - What did he write?

418
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.349
- to bet on losing. - What did he write?

419
00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.910
He bet 15 on losing.

420
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.550
- You are less than human! - It's not like that.

421
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.920
People bet their R Ddakjis on you.

422
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.589
He didn't bet 15, but 45.

423
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.959
- 45. - Hold on.

424
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.089
- Hold on. - You are less than human!

425
00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:46.189
- It's not like that. - You are less than human!

426
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:48.030
Why do the rules work that way?

427
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.530
- For goodness' sake. - 45.

428
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.130
You failed, Kwang Soo.

429
00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:53.699
(The current rankings: Jae Seok, Haha, Kwang Soo,)

430
00:15:53.699 --> 00:15:56.140
(So Min, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

431
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.239
(The current rankings: Jae Seok, Haha, Kwang Soo,)

432
00:15:57.239 --> 00:15:58.310
(Jong Kook, Seok Jin, So Min, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

433
00:15:58.369 --> 00:15:59.709
Kwang Soo.

434
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.380
Kwang Soo took a big loss.

435
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.410
You shouldn't have been so greedy.

436
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.079
I didn't think you would fail!

437
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.510
I couldn't do it.

438
00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:09.750
Jae Seok is in first place.

439
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.520
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" is in first place.

440
00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:14.189
- We have to stop it. - We can't let that happen.

441
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:16.459
- We have to stop it. - We will be dressed up as animals.

442
00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:18.560
Haha's "Man out of a Comic Book" is on the second place.

443
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.060
- It's a good one. - If you win this round,

444
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.599
yours will get chosen.

445
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.500
Should I go all in?

446
00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:25.599
This is the final round.

447
00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:29.369
The representatives for this round are...

448
00:16:29.369 --> 00:16:31.010
Seok Jin and Jong Kook.

449
00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:32.540
The mission is...

450
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.979
Dibidibidip.

451
00:16:34.979 --> 00:16:36.540
(Dibidibidip)

452
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.910
I don't know how it will go.

453
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.810
It doesn't go as you wish.

454
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.780
- This one... - I don't know how it will go.

455
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.890
I don't have a choice but to bet on winning.

456
00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:46.619
I will bet on winning.

457
00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:47.890
It will give us more R Ddakjis.

458
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.060
(A lot of members go all in.)

459
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.189
Look. This is my only chance.

460
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:54.229
(Jae Seok goes all in despite being in 1st place.)

461
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.160
He went all in. What is going on?

462
00:16:57.729 --> 00:16:59.599
You're going to go all in too.

463
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.839
I might lose.

464
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.099
Right? I might lose.

465
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.609
Seok Jin will go first.

466
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.379
Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Haha will defend.

467
00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.510
Do you want me to win?

468
00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.679
- You have to win. - I have to win.

469
00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:16.220
The outcome depends on the number of times you hold out.

470
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.690
The number of times I hold out.

471
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.190
- Ji Hyo. - I am done if Seok Jin loses.

472
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.020
- Hang in there. - Nevis Swing! Let's go!

473
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.419
- Let's go. - Nevis Swing.

474
00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:25.589
- Nevis... - In 1, 2, 3. Swing!

475
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.829
- He has to win. - He has to win.

476
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.260
- Winning is good. - Seok Jin.

477
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.730
Eliminate her right away.

478
00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:32.500
Eliminate her right away.

479
00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:34.030
Eliminate her right away.

480
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.800
- Eliminate her right away. - All right.

481
00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:39.010
Let's begin.

482
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.139
Dibidibidip.

483
00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:42.109
(He eliminates her in one try.)

484
00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:43.409
Okay.

485
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.349
He really beat her in one try.

486
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.649
Dibidibidip.

487
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.919
Dibidibidip.

488
00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:50.280
Okay!

489
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.950
(He eliminates 2 people in 2 turns.)

490
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.819
(This is incredible.)

491
00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:54.919
(Sighing)

492
00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:57.960
(Seok Jin is ready to eliminate...)

493
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.730
(3 people in 3 turns.)

494
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.159
(Can Seok Jin's third attack go as well?)

495
00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:05.569
(He is stopped.)

496
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.339
Okay. He did it.

497
00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:12.010
(He eliminates everyone in four turns.)

498
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.210
(He screams in excitement.)

499
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.109
- Dibidibidip. - Okay.

500
00:18:15.109 --> 00:18:16.280
(What happened?)

501
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.810
(He wins after four tries.)

502
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.149
Are you next?

503
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:20.210
He wins in four tries.

504
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.819
(Thanks to Seok Jin, Jae Seok is more likely to win.)

505
00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:24.190
Listen, Jae Seok.

506
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.389
- Go easy on me during your shoot. - Okay.

507
00:18:26.389 --> 00:18:27.889
Make me look nice.

508
00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:28.960
If he defeats everyone...

509
00:18:29.119 --> 00:18:31.659
Gosh, you're terrible.

510
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.790
(Haha)

511
00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.399
It's over if he defeats all at once.

512
00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:36.829
That's correct.

513
00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:40.399
(Haha's fate depends on Jong Kook.)

514
00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.599
(He's close to winning.)

515
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.310
Let's start.

516
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.240
- You can do it. - If Jong Kook...

517
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.909
defeats all of them,

518
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:49.909
it'll be very surprising.

519
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:51.480
Kim Jong Kook.

520
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.909
- Kim Jong Kook. - Kim Jong Kook.

521
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:54.280
- Nevis. - Kim Jong Kook.

522
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.280
Nevis.

523
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.349
Let's do it.

524
00:18:56.619 --> 00:18:58.319
Goodness.

525
00:18:58.849 --> 00:18:59.990
It won't be easy.

526
00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:01.990
Shall I start?

527
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960
Here I go.

528
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.230
(Will Haha's belief in Jong Kook help him win?)

529
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.200
Dibidibidip.

530
00:19:08.829 --> 00:19:09.829
Wait a minute.

531
00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:12.869
Dibidibidip.

532
00:19:13.399 --> 00:19:15.500
- Wait a minute. - Why?

533
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.000
I...

534
00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:18.310
Did you bet on your loss?

535
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.740
(Did he bet on his loss?)

536
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.109
- He did. - Kwang Soo.

537
00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:22.210
(I was supposed to lose.)

538
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.579
Do I win if I defend once more?

539
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.179
Do this next, Jong Kook.

540
00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:28.220
Do I win if I defend once more?

541
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.349
(Remember this, Kwang Soo.)

542
00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:31.349
That would be cheating.

543
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.889
Dibidibidip.

544
00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:41.159
(Gosh, I fell for it.)

545
00:19:43.429 --> 00:19:44.929
(That seemed natural.)

546
00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:47.099
Do a fake one.

547
00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:49.740
So Min, you must win.

548
00:19:50.069 --> 00:19:51.109
You have to win.

549
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.069
Dibidibidip.

550
00:19:53.069 --> 00:19:54.579
(Jong Kook was blocked once.)

551
00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:56.079
I really want to win.

552
00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:57.079
(This round determines the winner.)

553
00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:59.109
- It's for a month. - It'd be great.

554
00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:00.579
Dibidibidip.

555
00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:02.619
(She blocks him.)

556
00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:03.720
She blocked him.

557
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.919
Dibidibidip.

558
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.020
(Jong Kook loses.)

559
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.419
It's over.

560
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.119
(Jae Seok's victory is confirmed.)

561
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.730
I'm in complete darkness.

562
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.990
- It's over. - But...

563
00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:14.260
I'm not happy...

564
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.700
because I don't want to become a parrot.

565
00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:19.099
I won.

566
00:20:19.399 --> 00:20:20.770
It's the animal kingdom.

567
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:21.839
(The winner is "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".)

568
00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:24.540
The winning TV rating notice is...

569
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.310
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

570
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.780
What far do I go to dress up as a catfish?

571
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.780
- Pardon? - To dress up.

572
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.609
- I will... - How do I dress up as a giraffe?

573
00:20:32.609 --> 00:20:35.079
discuss with the staff in detail.

574
00:20:35.349 --> 00:20:36.480
I'll make it happen.

575
00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:39.950
It's called "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

576
00:20:40.389 --> 00:20:42.119
You'll simply dress up as animals.

577
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.589
(He prepares in detail.)

578
00:20:43.589 --> 00:20:45.889
(There are new shocking characters.)

579
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.629
(The terrible reality of "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals")

580
00:20:48.629 --> 00:20:52.669
(Jae Seok's shooting of TV rating notice is coming up soon.)

581
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.470
Everyone did a good job during the shoot.

582
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.540
Thank you.

583
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.310
- Thank you. - This is upsetting.

584
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.010
Let's do it one more time.

585
00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:03.409
Let's do it again after one month.

586
00:21:03.609 --> 00:21:06.349
I realized how seriously I must play.

587
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:07.349
No way.

588
00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.649
I gave them good roles, but they're upset.

589
00:21:09.819 --> 00:21:13.520
You must be hungry since we started early.

590
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.020
- That's right. - We're hungry.

591
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.990
We prepared Monday Tasting Session...

592
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.159
where you can eat whatever menu you want.

593
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.129
(Monday Tasting Session?)

594
00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:25.629
- This is necessary. - I'm so excited.

595
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:26.970
We haven't done it in a long time.

596
00:21:28.399 --> 00:21:31.169
(It's a delicious gift from the staff.)

597
00:21:31.569 --> 00:21:33.540
(Common lunch dishes...)

598
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.240
(are all in one place.)

599
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.510
Gukbap sounds good.

600
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.409
Vietnamese spring rolls?

601
00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:39.450
Steak?

602
00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:40.849
I want gukbap.

603
00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:42.550
What I want now is gukbap.

604
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.490
- What's this? - Among the dishes,

605
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.560
select the one that you'd like to eat.

606
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.619
Okay.

607
00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:51.889
- Really? - One dish we want?

608
00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:52.889
I want jjajangmyeon.

609
00:21:52.889 --> 00:21:54.230
(Jae Seok chooses jjajangmyeon.)

610
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.659
I want this one.

611
00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:56.929
Goodness.

612
00:21:56.929 --> 00:21:58.429
- I want Vietnamese spring rolls. - Get out of my way.

613
00:21:58.429 --> 00:21:59.770
You move.

614
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.940
- Mine is steak. - Mine is Vietnamese spring rolls.

615
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.470
Is that so? Mine is steak.

616
00:22:04.409 --> 00:22:06.609
(Each member picks a dish.)

617
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.040
Did you pick a dish?

618
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.109
- Yes. - Yes.

619
00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:11.649
With the name of the dish,

620
00:22:11.879 --> 00:22:13.480
each of you will jump...

621
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.149
on the box.

622
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:16.720
Four of them are filled with ice water.

623
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.349
The other four are safe.

624
00:22:18.349 --> 00:22:21.020
The menus chosen by those who fall into the ice water are eliminated.

625
00:22:22.389 --> 00:22:24.659
The menus chosen by the ones who are safe...

626
00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:26.159
are the menus you will eat.

627
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:30.329
(They can only try the menus chosen by the 4 surviving members.)

628
00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:31.470
Really?

629
00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:33.669
(Only half of the chosen dishes can be eaten.)

630
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:35.800
Please stand next to the box of your choice.

631
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:38.609
- Is yours 7? - Shall I pick 4?

632
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.109
I'll take four.

633
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:41.679
I'll take one.

634
00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:45.810
The menus of the members who falls into the water will be eliminated.

635
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:46.810
(If you fall, say goodbye to your menu.)

636
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.079
I want some chicken.

637
00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:49.379
I want gukbap.

638
00:22:49.379 --> 00:22:50.419
(Chicken)

639
00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:51.950
Please.

640
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.990
Okay.

641
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.790
1, 2, 3.

642
00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:57.589
(Se Chan's steak is out.)

643
00:22:57.589 --> 00:22:58.760
Goodness.

644
00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.889
I knew it.

645
00:22:59.889 --> 00:23:00.960
Pork cutlet.

646
00:23:01.359 --> 00:23:03.899
(Jjajangmyeon and pork cutlet are safe.)

647
00:23:03.899 --> 00:23:04.899
Let's go.

648
00:23:05.069 --> 00:23:06.530
I knew it.

649
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.839
(Vietnamese spring rolls are out.)

650
00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:09.000
Who's next?

651
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.069
(Chicken is out.)

652
00:23:11.069 --> 00:23:12.470
- 1, 2, 3. - 3.

653
00:23:13.169 --> 00:23:14.679
(Pork belly barbecue is safe.)

654
00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:16.179
That's great, Jong Kook.

655
00:23:16.179 --> 00:23:17.210
I'm hungry.

656
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.710
Shall we jump at the same time?

657
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.980
- At the same time? - Three dishes are safe.

658
00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.750
(One of them is safe.)

659
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.889
Please. What's yours?

660
00:23:25.089 --> 00:23:26.089
- Tangsuyuk. - Tangsuyuk?

661
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.619
Jjajangmyeon is safe, right?

662
00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:30.260
- Yes. - That's right.

663
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.030
- They'll jump together. - No.

664
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.060
They're similar.

665
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.060
One.

666
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200
Two.

667
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.300
(Gukbap and tangsuyuk)

668
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.470
- Two. - Get a shot of Ji Hyo's face.

669
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.099
He said to get a shot of her face.

670
00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:42.599
Is it me?

671
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.740
You can't tell each other.

672
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.970
That makes it obvious.

673
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.240
My goodness.

674
00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:49.639
You can't do that, Director.

675
00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:50.710
(Don't make it so obvious.)

676
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.980
Let's go. 1, 2, 3.

677
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.550
It's Ji Hyo. No, it's not.

678
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:55.619
Is it me?

679
00:23:56.079 --> 00:23:59.319
(Contrary to everyone's prediction, Haha is eliminated.)

680
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.260
(She gets tangsuyuk.)

681
00:24:02.089 --> 00:24:03.089
Is it me?

682
00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:04.530
(He gets fooled.)

683
00:24:05.659 --> 00:24:06.790
(The broken box reminds him.)

684
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.159
I jumped too confidently.

685
00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:09.230
(The broken box reminds him.)

686
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.230
I'm in complete darkness.

687
00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:15.869
The four dishes that you chose are...

688
00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:18.169
jjajangmyeon, pork belly, tangsuyuk, and pork cutlet...

689
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:19.369
for today.

690
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.210
For Monday Tasting Session,

691
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.579
today's real race is...

692
00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:26.480
(Today's real race is...)

693
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.950
It's called Someone's Bad Luck.

694
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.250
- What do you mean? - Happiness with 10 Dollars?

695
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:34.319
Within five hours,

696
00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:36.919
you must eat all four dishes...

697
00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:38.730
- with 10 dollars. - What?

698
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.260
You must eat all four dishes...

699
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.760
- with 10 dollars. - What?

700
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.899
(All with 10 dollars?)

701
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:45.000
All of them?

702
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.369
If you go over time...

703
00:24:46.369 --> 00:24:48.740
or fail to eat all the dishes with 10 dollars,

704
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.869
everyone will be penalized.

705
00:24:50.869 --> 00:24:52.169
What is he talking about?

706
00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:54.069
- Only use 10 dollars? - All 8 of us?

707
00:24:54.069 --> 00:24:56.609
Don't you know how much one jjajangmyeon is?

708
00:24:56.609 --> 00:24:57.810
What about tangsuyuk?

709
00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.349
During the race,

710
00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:01.050
the member who doesn't get to eat...

711
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.179
receives a Bad Luck Badge.

712
00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:04.619
If you clear the mission,

713
00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:07.450
the one with the most Bad Luck Badges places last.

714
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.760
The one who comes in last chooses another member...

715
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.530
to be penalized together.

716
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.560
Again?

717
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560
(Two members are penalized.)

718
00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:17.970
For 2018, the year of dog, the penalty is...

719
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.730
walking 10,000 steps with a dog penalty suit on.

720
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.839
(Walking 10,000 steps with a dog penalty suit on)

721
00:25:21.839 --> 00:25:23.899
- 10,000 steps? - The penalty is taking...

722
00:25:23.899 --> 00:25:26.240
10,000 steps.

723
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.379
Here's 10 dollars.

724
00:25:28.579 --> 00:25:31.250
How can we eat 4 dishes with 10 dollars?

725
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.310
We must go to cheap restaurants.

726
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.550
We should search the cheapest restaurants.

727
00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:37.919
- We don't have time. - Let's hurry.

728
00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:38.990
Let's go.

729
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.659
(Happiness with 10 Dollars race starts.)

730
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.060
(Where should we go first?)

731
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.960
Wait, where should we go?

732
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.530
(The timer is on.)

733
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.129
- The time started. - Right.

734
00:25:49.129 --> 00:25:50.260
There goes the time.

735
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.270
(Time limit is 5 hours.)

736
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.470
Where should we go first?

737
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.599
Let's eat jjajangmyeon first.

738
00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:54.639
- Jjajangmyeon? - Let's do that.

739
00:25:54.639 --> 00:25:55.800
Jjajangmyeon.

740
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.540
(They must find a cheap place to eat.)

741
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.510
- Let's go. - Machine jjajangmyeon.

742
00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:05.909
- A cheap restaurant... - Let's go here.

743
00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:08.649
I found jjajangmyeon that costs a dollar.

744
00:26:08.649 --> 00:26:09.679
- A dollar? - Yes.

745
00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.990
(Jjajangmyeon is a dollar?)

746
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.720
It costs a dollar.

747
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.020
- Where is it? - In Gunpo.

748
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.260
Let's go.

749
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.790
Are we going to Gunpo?

750
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.929
- Let's go. It's only a dollar. - Isn't it too far?

751
00:26:19.929 --> 00:26:21.129
There's enough gas in the car.

752
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.700
There's enough gas.

753
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.970
We should go there.

754
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.470
There's tangsuyuk for 1.5 dollars in Gangseo-gu.

755
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.369
- 1.5 dollars? - It's 1.5 dollars in Gangseo-gu.

756
00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:34.040
- Let's go to Gunpo. - Hey.

757
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.579
Let's go to Gunpo first.

758
00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:36.579
Why are you angry?

759
00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:37.710
Let's eat jjajangmyeon.

760
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.950
Why are you so angry?

761
00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:40.179
Let's go now.

762
00:26:40.179 --> 00:26:42.020
- Their break time starts at 3pm. - Let's go.

763
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.550
Let's go to Gunpo.

764
00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.550
(No one can stop Jae Seok from eating jjajangmyeon.)

765
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.290
Let's go to Gunpo.

766
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.389
Let me call the restaurant first.

767
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.629
Let's call first.

768
00:26:51.629 --> 00:26:53.829
We don't have time, so call in the car.

769
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.460
Why is Jae Seok so angry?

770
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.530
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

771
00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.569
Close the door.

772
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.200
(Close the door?)

773
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.369
I'm going to Gunpo, so get in another van.

774
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.679
I'm going to Gunpo, so get in another van.

775
00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:09.780
- What? - Wait for me.

776
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.280
- What's wrong? - Hurry. We don't have time.

777
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.980
- Goodness. - We have time.

778
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.149
Let's get in.

779
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:18.119
- I'll sit in the back. - Goodness.

780
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:20.089
Why are you so impatient?

781
00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:23.119
Hurry up. We don't have time.

782
00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:24.790
Goodness.

783
00:27:24.929 --> 00:27:28.030
Jae Seok, it's in Gunpo.

784
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.060
(No one can stop Jae Seok.)

785
00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:31.929
Jae Seok is so into it.

786
00:27:32.329 --> 00:27:33.899
- What's the number? - I have to go, Bo Pil.

787
00:27:33.899 --> 00:27:35.540
Please put on your seat belt.

788
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.970
I have to go, Bo Pil.

789
00:27:38.409 --> 00:27:40.409
Is it really a dollar in Anyang?

790
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:41.510
How can they make profit?

791
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.579
There's a place that sells pork cutlet for a dollar in Sanbon.

792
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.179
- What? - We can go after Gunpo.

793
00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:46.349
Let's eat everything there.

794
00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:48.780
- Is it okay if we go? - Yes.

795
00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:50.379
It's in Sanbon.

796
00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:51.720
(They head to the jjajangmyeon restaurant.)

797
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.290
Jjajangmyeon will be delicious.

798
00:27:53.649 --> 00:27:55.990
- Gosh, I'm so hungry. - It'll be delicious.

799
00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:59.030
I like green peas in jjajangmyeon.

800
00:27:59.359 --> 00:28:02.829
Fried egg with jjajangmyeon is good too.

801
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.129
- I agree. - Right.

802
00:28:04.429 --> 00:28:05.700
I like ground beef jjajangmyeon.

803
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.470
It's with ground beef.

804
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.200
- It's fun to pick out the beef. - It's expensive.

805
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.270
It's expensive though.

806
00:28:12.369 --> 00:28:14.940
Seok Jin, how much was jjajangmyeon when you were little?

807
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:20.250
(Seok Jin vaguely remembers how it tasted 40 years.)

808
00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:22.649
- How much... - Five cents?

809
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.250
I'd say 30 cents.

810
00:28:24.849 --> 00:28:25.919
- 30 cents. - I don't remember.

811
00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:29.990
They had to go to China if they wanted jjajangmyeon.

812
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.829
That's not true.

813
00:28:31.829 --> 00:28:33.030
They had to go to China.

814
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.329
It was the Korean Empire period.

815
00:28:34.329 --> 00:28:36.730
They had to travel to Tang Dynasty.

816
00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:37.730
Tang Dynasty?

817
00:28:38.329 --> 00:28:40.569
Tang Dynasty envoys would bring jjajangmyeon...

818
00:28:40.629 --> 00:28:44.040
when they were visiting our king.

819
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.139
Exactly.

820
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.079
You used brass coins, right?

821
00:28:50.179 --> 00:28:51.710
I did.

822
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.280
You did?

823
00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:55.319
He used Joseon coins.

824
00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:57.280
Joseon coins...

825
00:28:57.619 --> 00:28:59.250
(Have you ever seen secret royal inspectors?)

826
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.690
Have you ever seen secret royal inspectors?

827
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.730
Have you ever seen horse badges?

828
00:29:04.929 --> 00:29:06.490
One of my school friends became a secret royal inspector.

829
00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.359
One of your school friends?

830
00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:10.359
One of my school friends...

831
00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:12.169
He used to be such a troublemaker,

832
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:14.700
but he became a secret royal inspector.

833
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.700
(He passed the 17th-century state exam.)

834
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.440
I didn't know he became one.

835
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.240
Weren't you taken during the Manchu War of 1636?

836
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.079
I worked as a Japanese interpreter.

837
00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:26.649
(He even interpreted.)

838
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.250
It's the Qing Dynasty, not Japan.

839
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.190
It is?

840
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:38.260
One of the Qing commanders was Japanese.

841
00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:39.990
Were there really dinosaurs?

842
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.599
- What? - Were there really dinosaurs?

843
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.929
Did you evolve from a monkey?

844
00:29:44.099 --> 00:29:45.129
Bipedalism.

845
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.329
(Are you taking it that far?)

846
00:29:47.329 --> 00:29:50.200
Can you handle this one too?

847
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.139
Back then, my back didn't ache.

848
00:29:54.379 --> 00:29:57.440
My back became bad when I started walking on two legs.

849
00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.480
(He'll soon remember the time he was an ameba.)

850
00:29:59.849 --> 00:30:00.849
(From Seoul to Gunpo)

851
00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:03.879
I wonder how one-dollar jjajangmyeon tastes.

852
00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:07.589
This place was going to close down.

853
00:30:07.619 --> 00:30:09.760
That's why they started selling jjajangmyeon for one dollar.

854
00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:11.159
- But... - It became popular?

855
00:30:11.159 --> 00:30:13.060
It became so popular, and they're still in business.

856
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.089
(Their one-dollar jjajangmyeon became a hit.)

857
00:30:14.089 --> 00:30:15.300
That's incredible.

858
00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:17.730
(Mouth-watering)

859
00:30:18.369 --> 00:30:19.629
I think we're almost there.

860
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.139
Can't you use GPS?

861
00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:23.000
- It's in that building. - Are we here?

862
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.069
- I found it. "Free jjajangmyeon". - Okay.

863
00:30:25.109 --> 00:30:26.210
It's that place.

864
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:27.810
- "5-dollar tangsuyuk". - "5-dollar tangsuyuk".

865
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.579
- We found it! - Tangsuyuk costs five dollars?

866
00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:30.950
- Awesome. - One-dollar jjajangmyeon?

867
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.020
Is there really one-dollar jjajangmyeon?

868
00:30:35.619 --> 00:30:38.589
Can they get any profit?

869
00:30:39.349 --> 00:30:42.690
Running Man members are about to taste one-dollar jjajangmyeon.

870
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.790
My mouth is watering.

871
00:30:46.659 --> 00:30:50.460
Smell it. It smells so good. Ji Hyo, it smells great.

872
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.230
This costs only one dollar?

873
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.839
Hello.

874
00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:56.099
- Can we order? - Does it really cost one dollar?

875
00:30:56.099 --> 00:30:57.710
Excuse me.

876
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.970
Is it okay if we shoot in the corner?

877
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.440
- Sure. - Is it okay?

878
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.440
Thank you.

879
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.980
(Jjajangmyeon, 1 dollar)

880
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.349
Does it really cost only one dollar?

881
00:31:05.349 --> 00:31:07.149
It's incredible.

882
00:31:07.649 --> 00:31:10.750
Let's just eat as much as we want here.

883
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.990
Happiness with 10 Dollars. We're at the first restaurant now.

884
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.760
Order one portion,

885
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.460
and pay for it.

886
00:31:18.859 --> 00:31:21.629
Before we start,

887
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:23.599
let's decide how many people will eat here...

888
00:31:23.599 --> 00:31:25.470
by playing a game.

889
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.240
Choose one customer here.

890
00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:32.540
The number of bills the customer has...

891
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.839
will determine how many people will eat.

892
00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:38.210
Each member will randomly draw...

893
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.310
a number.

894
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:44.750
The result will determine who will eat here.

895
00:31:44.849 --> 00:31:46.389
Those who don't get to eat here...

896
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:49.359
will get a Bad Luck Badge.

897
00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:51.290
If the customer has eight bills, everyone gets to eat?

898
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.300
The bigger your number is, the lower your chance is.

899
00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:57.200
I guess up to three people will eat.

900
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.800
If the customer has one bill, will only one person eat?

901
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.470
Yes.

902
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.069
Eight would be the worst.

903
00:32:02.069 --> 00:32:03.240
(Smaller numbers are better.)

904
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.240
Let's see.

905
00:32:05.369 --> 00:32:06.440
I want one.

906
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.780
(Who will lucky and choose a low number?)

907
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.079
Please.

908
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.550
This.

909
00:32:12.349 --> 00:32:15.220
- Seok Jin, turn your spoon around. - I haven't seen mine.

910
00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:18.190
It's five.

911
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.220
- Can I try again? - It's over.

912
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.690
It's my turn.

913
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.359
I doubt it's eight.

914
00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:24.359
(Jae Seok's turn)

915
00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:28.230
- Four. - It's not bad.

916
00:32:28.659 --> 00:32:30.429
- Three. - Three.

917
00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:31.429
Three.

918
00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:32.429
My turn.

919
00:32:32.899 --> 00:32:34.270
Eight.

920
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.040
(Haha picked 8.)

921
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.770
I'm in complete darkness.

922
00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:40.980
It's true. You've been very unlucky these days.

923
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.339
Here we go.

924
00:32:43.339 --> 00:32:44.849
(Kwang Soo's turn)

925
00:32:44.849 --> 00:32:45.849
Six.

926
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.220
4, 5, 6.

927
00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.649
1, 2, 3 are left.

928
00:32:49.649 --> 00:32:50.679
Seven is left too.

929
00:32:50.919 --> 00:32:52.819
Let's turn them around at the same time. 1, 2, 3.

930
00:32:52.819 --> 00:32:54.220
(1, 2, and 7 are left.)

931
00:32:58.129 --> 00:32:59.129
It's seven.

932
00:32:59.329 --> 00:33:01.329
(So Min: 1, Ji Hyo: 2)

933
00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:02.700
Yes.

934
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.899
It's seven.

935
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.069
- Choose one customer now. - The lady.

936
00:33:08.069 --> 00:33:10.169
Hold on. Let's look around.

937
00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:12.909
They must be friends.

938
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.609
- There's a lady over there too. - Choose the lady.

939
00:33:14.609 --> 00:33:15.710
- This lady? - Yes.

940
00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:19.179
- Because... - Could we see...

941
00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:21.319
how many bills you have?

942
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.819
Mothers usually use credit cards. It's students that use...

943
00:33:23.819 --> 00:33:26.290
No, it's not like that.

944
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.119
- Are you sure? - Because...

945
00:33:28.119 --> 00:33:29.560
Just sit down.

946
00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.560
Be quiet.

947
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.129
The number of bills in her wallet.

948
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.829
- Just the bills? - Yes.

949
00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:37.359
(The number of bills will determine how many members can eat.)

950
00:33:37.883 --> 00:33:42.883

952
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:46.710
one...

953

(Two bills)

954
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.480
She must use credit cards.

955
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.349
- Thank you. - It's 11 dollars.

956
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.550
- Thank you. - She must use credit cards.

957

Who will get to eat?

959
00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:05.829
Just those two will eat.

960
00:34:05.829 --> 00:34:07.859
I wanted jjajangmyeon.

961
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.329
(We get to eat.)

962
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.000
Could Kwang Soo have been right about students?

963
00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.599
Do you have any bills?

964
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.170
How many do you have?

965
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.540
In your wallet.

966
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.540
Wait.

967
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.610
(A lot)

968
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.279
- Gosh. - I knew it.

969
00:34:29.279 --> 00:34:30.349
He has more than 10.

970
00:34:31.049 --> 00:34:32.849
What did I say?

971
00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:33.989
(Kwang Soo is speechless.)

972
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.989
(We should have listened to him.)

973
00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:37.219
What did I tell you?

974
00:34:37.259 --> 00:34:38.389
Students use cash.

975
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:39.560
You have a lot of cash.

976
00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.329
(Disappointed)

977
00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.400
Kid, are you going to eat that?

978
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.699
- Stop it. - Gosh.

979
00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.000
Don't do that.

980
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.639
- You shouldn't leave any food. - Be quiet.

981
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.639
Stop it.

982
00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.270
Be quiet.

983
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.480
Those who don't get to eat will receive a Bad Luck Badge.

984
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.849
My goodness.

985
00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:01.119
(Bad Luck Badges)

986
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:03.119
Two bowls of jjajangmyeon are served.

987
00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.549
- Gosh. - So Min and Ji Hyo.

988
00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:07.719
(They're for So Min and Ji Hyo.)

989
00:35:07.759 --> 00:35:09.219
Like this?

990
00:35:09.219 --> 00:35:10.460
Two bowls are served.

991
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.329
Even though we paid for one portion?

992
00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:13.630
(One-dollar jjajangmyeon for So Min and Ji Hyo)

993
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.460
- We could have all eaten. - Exactly.

994
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.230
We could have all eaten.

995
00:35:17.799 --> 00:35:19.199
I thought we were going to share one bowl.

996
00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:21.639
- Let me mix it for you. - Can I get chili powder?

997
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.340
I thought we were going to share one bowl.

998
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.770
- So did I. - After we're done shooting,

999
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.710
come back here.

1000
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.179
- It looks so tasty. - You can eat then.

1001
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:34.719
- I want it so badly. - Jjajangmyeon...

1002
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:36.750
She's eating it.

1003
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.520
Eat it with pickled radish.

1004
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.520
- The slurping sound. - Does it taste good?

1005
00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:43.719
Eat it with pickled radish.

1006
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.130
It looks tasty.

1007
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.199
(It's driving me crazy.)

1008
00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:50.060
- It tastes really good. - I can't believe...

1009
00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.130
it costs only one dollar.

1010
00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:53.770
- It doesn't taste cheap. - There's enough sauce too.

1011
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:56.739
- It's just right. - It's sweet and spicy.

1012
00:35:56.739 --> 00:35:57.739
Guys.

1013
00:35:57.739 --> 00:35:58.739
(It's sweet and spicy.)

1014
00:35:59.239 --> 00:36:01.340
(I'm happy I'm so lucky.)

1015
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.110
We came all the way to Gunpo. Can't we...

1016
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.110
Call your friends.

1017
00:36:05.179 --> 00:36:07.250
Guys, why don't we order one more bowl?

1018
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:10.250
- Don't do that. - Can we do that?

1019
00:36:10.449 --> 00:36:14.090
If you really want to eat,

1020
00:36:14.659 --> 00:36:16.719
- pay another dollar... - Are we going to draw again?

1021
00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:17.790
Are we drawing again?

1022
00:36:17.929 --> 00:36:21.099
The one who draws one will get to eat.

1023
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.159
- One? - Okay.

1024
00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:24.429
I want one.

1025
00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.900
Let's draw one at the same time.

1026
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.770
- Draw one. - Let's do it together.

1027
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.369
Please.

1028
00:36:29.369 --> 00:36:30.540
- At the same time. - Please.

1029
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.369
I'm not sure if I'll be lucky.

1030
00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:34.310
Please. Just this once.

1031
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.040
Hold on.

1032
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.549
What did you pick?

1033
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:39.949
- What's your number? - Six.

1034
00:36:39.949 --> 00:36:42.020
We're 6 people, and I picked 6.

1035
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.779
That was close. Two.

1036
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.349
- The rest... - I still have a chance.

1037
00:36:46.389 --> 00:36:48.219
- It's your turn. - Turn it around.

1038
00:36:48.219 --> 00:36:51.230
You know how much I love jjajangmyeon, right?

1039
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360
Please.

1040
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.829
I want my number to change to one.

1041
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:56.360
Jae Seok chose this place.

1042
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.429
(I want my number to change to one.)

1043
00:36:58.429 --> 00:36:59.529
Jae Seok chose this place.

1044
00:36:59.529 --> 00:37:00.529
What are you doing?

1045
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.099
- Five. - I still have a chance.

1046
00:37:03.099 --> 00:37:05.469
(Jae Seok is eliminated.)

1047
00:37:05.469 --> 00:37:06.469
I have a chance.

1048
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.980
I actually don't want it that much.

1049
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.849
- Could it be Jong Kook? - Let me eat.

1050
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:12.349
I have a feeling it's Jong Kook.

1051
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:13.349
Should Jong Kook wait?

1052
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:15.449
The two of us should go first. You go first.

1053
00:37:15.449 --> 00:37:16.719
(Kwang Soo checks his number.)

1054
00:37:16.719 --> 00:37:19.349
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1055
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:21.060
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1056
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.090
Could it be Jong Kook?

1057
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.929
(It's either Haha or Jong Kook.)

1058
00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:27.630
It's either of these two.

1059
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.460
- Jong Kook... - But...

1060
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.469
(Please let me eat.)

1061
00:37:31.469 --> 00:37:32.529
- Jjajangmyeon... - Should I go first?

1062
00:37:32.529 --> 00:37:33.929
Hold on.

1063
00:37:33.929 --> 00:37:35.469
(Please let me eat.)

1064
00:37:35.469 --> 00:37:36.940
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1065
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.739
(Shouting)

1066
00:37:41.079 --> 00:37:43.639
(Haha is exhilarated.)

1067
00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:49.079
(Haha surpassed the darkness and picked 1.)

1068
00:37:50.279 --> 00:37:52.049
(My goodness.)

1069
00:37:52.049 --> 00:37:53.049
Haha.

1070
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.119
Thank you.

1071
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.460
Whatever. I'll just eat it.

1072
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.759
Hey.

1073
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.099
You're breaking the rules.

1074
00:38:02.529 --> 00:38:04.029
Pay another dollar and try again.

1075
00:38:04.529 --> 00:38:05.570
No.

1076
00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.739
If you run out of time,

1077
00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:08.739
- Right. - everyone will be penalized.

1078
00:38:08.739 --> 00:38:09.840
Let's hurry.

1079
00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:12.040
It looks like more than one serving.

1080
00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:13.670
My gosh, this is amazing.

1081
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:16.840
(Slurping)

1082
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.009
I really want to eat it.

1083
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.119
(It's driving him crazy as he can hear and see the noodles.)

1084
00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:27.119
- Doesn't it look really delicious? - Yes, indeed.

1085
00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:28.960
I will let you have a bite if you take my badge.

1086
00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:30.960
(Haha, the strategist, makes a sweet deal.)

1087
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.259
- My gosh, that's really tempting. - Goodness.

1088
00:38:32.259 --> 00:38:33.460
- I will give you this much. - My gosh, you...

1089
00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.630
I will feed you this much.

1090
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.199
- If you take this. - Dear me.

1091
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.000
5, 4...

1092
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.270
We have to go to four places.

1093
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.099
(I can't stop thinking about the slurping sound.)

1094
00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:44.270
(Will someone be tempted to accept this deal?)

1095
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:45.639
- I'm in! - Okay.

1096
00:38:45.639 --> 00:38:48.710
(Kwang Soo, the lover of jjajangmyeon, is in.)

1097
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.179
(He's a slave to his desire.)

1098
00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:52.679
- I'll give you the Bad Luck Badge. - You can't...

1099
00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:53.849
- skimp on the food. - Okay.

1100
00:38:54.179 --> 00:38:55.650
(I should've gone for it.)

1101
00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:56.820
Gosh, that looks so tasty.

1102
00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.049
- All right. - Let me taste it.

1103
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.190
- Hey, here it is. - Give him a lot.

1104
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.920
- I'm going to give you a lot. - Okay.

1105
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.460
- Here you go. 1, 2, 3. - My gosh.

1106
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.489
I really want to eat jjajangmyeon.

1107
00:39:05.489 --> 00:39:06.759
(Eating someone else's food is the tastiest.)

1108
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:09.599
(I'm not going to watch this.)

1109
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.270
- Whose badge is that now? - Can't we give it to other people?

1110
00:39:16.299 --> 00:39:18.540
- We need to go to the next place. - Right.

1111
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.670
- Let's have pork belly. - What's next?

1112
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.610
- Let's eat pork belly next. - Yes, let's do that.

1113
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.610
There's a thin pork belly place near Bucheon Station.

1114
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.710
- It's open 24 hours. - Let's go.

1115
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.110
Let's go to Bucheon.

1116
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.150
- You must order one serving. - Let's get going first.

1117
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.320
It is cheap.

1118
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.090
(The number of Bad Luck Badges for each member)

1119
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:36.020
- We'll have pork belly next. - That sounds good too.

1120
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.329
I'm going to put rice, a piece of pork belly,

1121
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.759
garlic with gochujang on top of the lettuce.

1122
00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:43.000
garlic with gochujang on top of the lettuce.

1123
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.329
I'm going to eat it with salt.

1124
00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:48.000
- I'm so hungry. - We must eat it with rice.

1125
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.400
I think we're almost there.

1126
00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:51.739
- We are 3.7km away. - All right.

1127
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.340
(Humming)

1128
00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.110
We got here faster than I thought.

1129
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.179
(Seok Jin starts humming all of a sudden.)

1130
00:40:02.619 --> 00:40:03.920
(Glancing)

1131
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.520
(Singing)

1132
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.920
What was the name of the song?

1133
00:40:12.389 --> 00:40:13.730
(He makes a trumpet sound.)

1134
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:14.929
- What? - That was good.

1135
00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:17.259
- I was surprised with myself too. - Hey, that sounded really cool.

1136
00:40:17.259 --> 00:40:18.369
Let's try that again.

1137
00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:20.670
(They suddenly form an a capella group.)

1138
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.570
(So Min joins in too.)

1139
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.869
What is that?

1140
00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:28.739
(Drop the beat.)

1141
00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:29.880
Hey, we sound great.

1142
00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:33.210
(Their questionable song continues.)

1143
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.650
(It's caught between being a noise and a song.)

1144
00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.560
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo is enjoying the song in her dreams.)

1145
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.560
How could Ji Hyo sleep in this commotion?

1146
00:40:47.029 --> 00:40:48.159
Is she sleeping? My gosh, Ji Hyo is sleeping?

1147
00:40:48.159 --> 00:40:49.400
Is she sleeping? My gosh, Ji Hyo is sleeping?

1148
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.529
(It must have been the tasty jjajangmyeon.)

1149
00:40:50.529 --> 00:40:51.869
- We are here. We arrived. - We're at the restaurant.

1150
00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:53.029
- We are here. We arrived. - We're at the restaurant.

1151
00:40:53.029 --> 00:40:54.969
- Jae Seok, it's this one here. - This is it.

1152
00:40:55.239 --> 00:40:56.340
Let's eat!

1153
00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.139
- Let's eat! - It's 2 dollars and 50 cents.

1154
00:40:58.139 --> 00:40:59.469
- No way. - This is the place.

1155
00:40:59.469 --> 00:41:01.739
- Look. It's open 24 hours. - It's 2 dollars and 50 cents.

1156
00:41:01.779 --> 00:41:03.340
How could it be only 2 dollars and 50 cents?

1157
00:41:03.639 --> 00:41:05.250
My gosh, thin pork belly. I love it.

1158
00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.779
- It's only 2 dollars and 50 cents? - Hello.

1159
00:41:07.779 --> 00:41:10.949
- Has the owner gone mad? - My gosh.

1160
00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:13.119
- It's only 2 dollars and 50 cents? - Yes.

1161
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.719
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1162
00:41:15.719 --> 00:41:17.060
I'm sorry to ask this,

1163
00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:19.860
but could we film in this restaurant?

1164
00:41:20.929 --> 00:41:22.259
- Would it be okay? - Sure.

1165
00:41:22.259 --> 00:41:24.099
- Thank you, ma'am. - We'll film only on this side.

1166
00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:25.699
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1167
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.440
My gosh, the owner seems really good-natured.

1168
00:41:30.299 --> 00:41:33.909
(The cameras are set up quickly to film at the corner.)

1169
00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:35.009
We're rolling.

1170
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.610
- You've arrived now. - Yes, we have.

1171
00:41:38.449 --> 00:41:40.310
This time, you won't have to choose a number.

1172
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.619
- All of you might be able to eat. - Okay!

1173
00:41:42.619 --> 00:41:43.750
- Awesome. - What is the mission?

1174
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.119
For this mission,

1175
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.590
you'll choose either odd or even.

1176
00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:48.619
How are we going to play that?

1177
00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:51.829
Whoever correctly guesses whether the number of spoons...

1178
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:53.159
and chopsticks is odd or even will get to eat.

1179
00:41:53.929 --> 00:41:55.299
- This is an individual game. - Right.

1180
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:58.699
- I can shake this, right? - Yes, you can.

1181
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.900
Of course.

1182
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.570
- It sounds like there are a lot. - The chopsticks are in there too.

1183
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.710
Hey, Jae Seok, what do you think?

1184
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:07.779
(I can pick the opposite of his choice.)

1185
00:42:07.779 --> 00:42:08.810
I'll choose the opposite.

1186
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:10.909
- I'll go last. - No, tell us.

1187
00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:13.079
- I want to pick the opposite. - Let's choose the same answer.

1188
00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:14.480
What do you think, So Min?

1189
00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:15.750
I'll go with odd.

1190
00:42:16.279 --> 00:42:17.590
- Me too. - Odd?

1191
00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.719
- Odd? - Then I'll go with even.

1192
00:42:18.889 --> 00:42:20.150
Even, odd, even.

1193
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.989
Hey, everyone. What about this?

1194
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.790
If you think it's odd, go that side. Come here if you think it's even.

1195
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:25.929
- That was clever. - Okay.

1196
00:42:25.929 --> 00:42:27.329
My gosh, we picked different choices. This is bad.

1197
00:42:27.329 --> 00:42:28.860
- Which side is for even? - This side.

1198
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.929
This side is for even, and that side is for odd.

1199
00:42:30.929 --> 00:42:33.000
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo choose odd.)

1200
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.969
- I'll count one by one. - All right.

1201
00:42:35.099 --> 00:42:36.139
Okay.

1202
00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:37.239
- Odd. - Okay.

1203
00:42:37.239 --> 00:42:38.340
Don't play any tricks now.

1204
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.009
- Don't play tricks. - You think so lowly of me.

1205
00:42:40.509 --> 00:42:41.779
- Even. - Even.

1206
00:42:41.779 --> 00:42:43.239
- Let's all say it. Odd. - Odd!

1207
00:42:43.239 --> 00:42:44.310
That's great.

1208
00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:45.579
- Even! - Even!

1209
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:47.750
- Odd! - Odd!

1210
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:49.980
- Even! - Even!

1211
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.920
Hey, this is making me so nervous.

1212
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.549
- Odd. We're almost there. - We are almost done.

1213
00:42:54.159 --> 00:42:55.820
(Does he have 1 or 2 spoons left?)

1214
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.119
He has more.

1215
00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:59.659
- There are two left. - It looks like there are more.

1216
00:42:59.659 --> 00:43:00.829
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo chose odd.)

1217
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:02.130
(Jae Seok, Haha, Se Chan, and So Min chose even.)

1218
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:04.400
Gosh, there are two left.

1219
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.699
(Fidgeting)

1220
00:43:05.699 --> 00:43:09.239
Wait, why are you putting the spoon between your bottom?

1221
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.739
- Why are you doing that? - No, this is the last one.

1222
00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:12.409
(I only have one left. There's an even number of them.)

1223
00:43:12.409 --> 00:43:13.670
Odd!

1224
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.239
- Yes! - Hold on.

1225
00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:17.210
(He finds a deeply hidden spoon.)

1226
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.710
- Hey. - All right. It's odd.

1227
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:19.980
(He fails to hide a spoon.)

1228
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.880
- Don't join Jae Seok. Then you win. - Seriously?

1229
00:43:23.579 --> 00:43:24.750
I wasn't even expecting to win.

1230
00:43:24.949 --> 00:43:26.150
(The losing members will receive Bad Luck Badges.)

1231
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.860
- Four servings of pork belly. - My gosh, Jae Seok.

1232
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.290
They have to get the badges too, right?

1233
00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.590
(The number of Bad Luck Badges for each member)

1234
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:34.799
(The thin pork belly is being grilled on the pan.)

1235
00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:37.130
- My goodness. - Oh, my. Can you hear it sizzling?

1236
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.369
- It looks good, Seok Jin. - This is amazing.

1237
00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:41.139
Don't grill them. You have to stir-fry them.

1238
00:43:41.139 --> 00:43:43.739
- Right. That's the way to go. - Stop teasing us.

1239
00:43:43.739 --> 00:43:45.670
- The oil seeps out. - You're right.

1240
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.040
- Cook kimchi too. - We can cook kimchi with it.

1241
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.610
(I'd give anything to eat that.)

1242
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.210
(This is like a torture for members who lost.)

1243
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.779
My goodness. Look at this.

1244
00:43:52.279 --> 00:43:54.480
Seriously? You're not good at cooking pork melly.

1245
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.779
- Seriously. - "Pork melly"?

1246
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.790
- I bet you want to eat this. - You don't know how to cook it.

1247
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:59.820
- Move aside. - Are you trying to eat this?

1248
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.989
No, no. Let me cook it for you.

1249
00:44:00.989 --> 00:44:02.719
- No, that's all right. - Come on.

1250
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.230
- Why are you hitting me? - There's no need.

1251
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.259
- What's wrong with you? - Let me cook it for you.

1252
00:44:06.259 --> 00:44:08.230
- Why would you cook it for us? - Come on. Move aside.

1253
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.929
- Hey, eat up. - My goodness.

1254
00:44:09.929 --> 00:44:11.199
- Are you serious? - Why are you doing this?

1255
00:44:11.199 --> 00:44:12.429
This is how you ought to do it.

1256
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.400
- Unbelievable. - Hey, hold on. Hey.

1257
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.070
(His hands are swifter than their eyes.)

1258
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.139
- Get it. - Wait.

1259
00:44:18.139 --> 00:44:19.670
There's a fight going on over there.

1260
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.639
(They are searching and seizing the hidden pork belly.)

1261
00:44:22.639 --> 00:44:24.849
(Screaming in pain)

1262
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:27.619
I researched a lot about this while watching TV.

1263
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.250
(He's always improving as he watches the shows.)

1264
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.790
I studied a lot about you.

1265
00:44:33.449 --> 00:44:34.590
- He's bleeding! - My gosh!

1266
00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:35.860
Hey.

1267
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.860
(Shall we enjoy our meal now?)

1268
00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.460
- I got to taste one. - He ate one in the end.

1269
00:44:41.299 --> 00:44:42.400
I ate it.

1270
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.799
(Place the piece of meat, a bit of doenjang,)

1271
00:44:46.799 --> 00:44:48.369
(and seasoned, sliced spring onions.)

1272
00:44:48.369 --> 00:44:50.099
- It's true. - Haha.

1273
00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:56.239
(This is the pork belly that brings joy to Ji Hyo.)

1274
00:44:56.779 --> 00:44:57.949
I gave you half of my jjajangmyeon.

1275
00:44:59.079 --> 00:45:00.949
(The meat impresses him right away.)

1276
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.150
I will buy someone's Bad Luck Badge.

1277
00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:07.320
I'm going to trade one.

1278
00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.520
(Haha and Se Chan get a bite and take the badge.)

1279
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.159
- That's good. - Why are you doing this?

1280
00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:11.659
- You're going to take my badge. - Okay.

1281
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:13.630
- No, you can't do that. - I can't help myself.

1282
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.199
(It's a good deal for Kwang Soo since he has two badges.)

1283
00:45:15.199 --> 00:45:16.960
I sold my badge to him. I gave it back to him.

1284
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.900
(Se Chan and Haha receive 1 more badge.)

1285
00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:24.139
- Give him your badge. - Come on, do it.

1286
00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:26.310
- Yes, give one to Jae Seok. - Give it to Jae Seok.

1287
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:28.110
(Should I try getting rid of mine too?)

1288
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.380
- Everyone. - Hey.

1289
00:45:30.639 --> 00:45:33.980
I will give this to whoever takes my badge.

1290
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.150
No, no. Forget it.

1291
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.320
(No, no. Forget it.)

1292
00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:41.460
- Gosh, he's so annoying. - Forget it.

1293
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:43.790
Why would I take his badge?

1294
00:45:43.989 --> 00:45:45.960
- Why would I do that? - Give him your badge.

1295
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.460
- The price was very reasonable, - Right.

1296
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.659
- but the meat was fresh. - It was very delicious.

1297
00:45:50.759 --> 00:45:53.070
- Which food will you try next? - I didn't even get to eat a lot.

1298
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.599
- Tangsuyuk in Mok-dong. - Let's eat pork cutlet.

1299
00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:55.969
- Shouldn't we eat tangsuyuk? - Did you find a place?

1300
00:45:55.969 --> 00:45:57.670
- Tangsuyuk! - It's time for tangsuyuk.

1301
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:58.840
- Tangsuyuk. - It's cheap.

1302
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.440
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1303
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.909
I have to eat tangsuyuk.

1304
00:46:03.509 --> 00:46:06.579
- We don't have much time left. - We're running out of time.

1305
00:46:06.579 --> 00:46:08.549
If we don't finish on time, all of us will face the punishment.

1306
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:09.679
- Exactly. - That's right.

1307
00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:11.250
It's going to be evening rush hour soon.

1308
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:12.549
- There will be a lot of traffic. - Precisely.

1309
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:13.750
- So we must hurry. - Luckily,

1310
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.860
tangsuyuk and pork cutlet restaurants are nearby.

1311
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.529
I must eat tangsuyuk. Seriously. That's only fair.

1312
00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:20.429
I'll choose tangsuyuk over pork cutlet.

1313
00:46:20.429 --> 00:46:21.529
Let me have tangsuyuk.

1314
00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:22.829
Tangsuyuk must be delicious too.

1315
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:24.829
Strangely, we are only eating pork today.

1316
00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.230
- That's right. - If I eat tangsuyuk...

1317
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.699
(She sounds happy.)

1318
00:46:27.699 --> 00:46:29.139
(Eat ulmyeon in sadness, eat jjajangmyeon when you're annoyed)

1319
00:46:29.139 --> 00:46:30.570
I'm annoyed, so be quiet.

1320
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.139
(I'm starving right now.)

1321
00:46:32.139 --> 00:46:33.469
(She stubbornly sings the song.)

1322
00:46:33.469 --> 00:46:34.909
(Tangsuyuk)

1323
00:46:34.909 --> 00:46:36.380
- Tangsuyuk - Tangsuyuk

1324
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.549
My goodness.

1325
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:39.349
If I don't get to eat tangsuyuk,

1326
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:40.380
it won't be pretty then.

1327
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.349
I don't think you will be able to eat pork cutlet either.

1328
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:44.619
- Jae Seok can't eat that either. - Right?

1329
00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:45.989
- Hey, Se Chan. - Yes?

1330
00:46:45.989 --> 00:46:48.190
Se Chan, you'd better watch your tongue.

1331
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.590
- It's either me or you. - Today, I'm...

1332
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.029
I'm really on the edge today.

1333
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.829
I have a feeling that Jae Seok will go back on an empty stomach.

1334
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:57.000
(Look at that joker.)

1335
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.400
This is driving me crazy.

1336
00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.730
- Hey, we're here. - Yes, we are.

1337
00:47:01.369 --> 00:47:02.869
- We are only 400m away. - There's a college here?

1338
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:04.239
We are almost there.

1339
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.139
Besides, since we don't have much time, we must hurry.

1340
00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:08.610
When we get there, we'll finish the game quickly.

1341
00:47:08.779 --> 00:47:10.409
We'll move things along really fast.

1342
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.980
My gosh, I can't believe we actually found this place and came.

1343
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.549
- My gosh. - That's pork cutlet!

1344
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.020
- It's only two dollars! - That looks good.

1345
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.549
Goodness, let's get pork cutlet.

1346
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:19.949
(There's a pork cutlet restaurant next to the tangsuyuk restaurant.)

1347
00:47:19.949 --> 00:47:21.659
Hey, the pork cutlet costs only two dollars. We'll be done then.

1348
00:47:21.659 --> 00:47:23.060
(How amazing!)

1349
00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:24.860
- It's right next to each other. - It's next to the other restaurant.

1350
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.090
They are next to each other.

1351
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.159
- We will accomplish our mission. - This is incredible.

1352
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.759
- This is the tangsuyuk place. - This is it.

1353
00:47:30.759 --> 00:47:32.170
- Here it is. - 1 dollar and 50 cents!

1354
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:33.529
This must be the place.

1355
00:47:33.529 --> 00:47:34.670
Hey, a bowl of anchovy noodles is only a dollar.

1356
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:36.000
(Tangsuyuk, 1 dollar and 50 cents)

1357
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.909
We can walk to the next restaurant after this.

1358
00:47:37.909 --> 00:47:39.469
They are right next to each other.

1359
00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:40.639
How could this be possible?

1360
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:44.509
- Excuse me, could we film in here? - Yes.

1361
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:45.880
- Could we film in here? - Would you be okay with that?

1362
00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.520
- Is that all right with you? - Thank you.

1363
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.849
All right. Thank you.

1364
00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:51.150
- Is it only 1 dollar and 50 cents? - Hello.

1365
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:53.150
- Is that so? - We'll have some while we shoot.

1366
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.420
- We're sorry. - Thank you.

1367
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.960
- My gosh, this is amazing. - I see.

1368
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.020
(Which members will get to eat?)

1369
00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.190
Thank you.

1370
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.730
I'm surprised that we found this place and actually came here.

1371
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.670
- "1 dollar and 50 cents"? - How could it be so cheap?

1372
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.599
It's crispy and savory.

1373
00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:10.799
Freshly-fried tangsuyuk costs only 1 dollar and 50 cents.

1374
00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:11.840
(It's only 1 dollar and 50 cents!)

1375
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.909
I'm jealous of people who live in the neighborhood.

1376
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:16.880
Students must come here often.

1377
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.210
It's perfect for students.

1378
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.849
It's not only for students.

1379
00:48:20.849 --> 00:48:22.150
(How many will enjoy tangsuyuk?)

1380
00:48:22.449 --> 00:48:23.619
I hope we all get to eat it.

1381
00:48:23.719 --> 00:48:26.119
Here's the next mission.

1382
00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:28.020
- There are four in the kitchen. - Right.

1383
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.329
Ask one of them for their age.

1384
00:48:31.329 --> 00:48:36.199
The number of members that corresponds to the first digit of...

1385
00:48:36.199 --> 00:48:38.070
their age will get to eat.

1386
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.699
The 10th digit?

1387
00:48:39.699 --> 00:48:40.940
No, the first digit.

1388
00:48:41.369 --> 00:48:43.670
- If it's 31, 1 gets to eat. - 1 person gets to eat.

1389
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:44.770
(It depends on their age.)

1390
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:48.279
We must select someone in their late 20s or 30s.

1391
00:48:48.679 --> 00:48:50.210
We can all eat if the age is 28.

1392
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.909
What if it's zero like 30?

1393
00:48:52.909 --> 00:48:53.980
No one gets to eat.

1394
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.420
We're in trouble.

1395
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.079
Choose a number.

1396
00:48:57.079 --> 00:48:59.790
We should choose the early digits.

1397
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.790
It's difficult.

1398
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:02.060
Pick one, Kwang Soo.

1399
00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.790
(Kwang Soo starts.)

1400
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.230
I'll eat tangsuyuk no matter what.

1401
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:08.299
What's your number?

1402
00:49:08.529 --> 00:49:09.730
1, 2, 3.

1403
00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.969
(Which number did he pick?)

1404
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.070
(He gets number 8.)

1405
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.279
(We knew it.)

1406
00:49:21.279 --> 00:49:22.810
He was so determined to eat.

1407
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.139
(Why does it always happen to me?)

1408
00:49:24.139 --> 00:49:25.679
I bet you won't get to eat.

1409
00:49:25.679 --> 00:49:26.880
That's hilarious.

1410
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.949
Who's next?

1411
00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:29.520
I want to eat something.

1412
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.779
1, 2, 3.

1413
00:49:30.779 --> 00:49:32.049
(Se Chan gets 7.)

1414
00:49:32.049 --> 00:49:33.090
- 7. - 7.

1415
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:34.119
What is it?

1416
00:49:34.119 --> 00:49:35.520
- 7. - In 2, 3.

1417
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.090
(So Min gets 5.)

1418
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.659
- Five. - Ji Hyo?

1419
00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:39.989
- 4. - She gets 4.

1420
00:49:40.329 --> 00:49:41.860
I'm next. In 2, 3.

1421
00:49:42.429 --> 00:49:44.429
- Mine is 6. - It's 6.

1422
00:49:44.429 --> 00:49:45.670
(Haha gets number 6.)

1423
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.770
- We'll get... - They're 1, 2, 3.

1424
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:49.000
- We're 1, 2, 3. - We'll eat no matter what.

1425
00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:50.340
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1426
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.710
I got two.

1427
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.440
- Am I 1? - 3.

1428
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.239
(Seok Jin is 3, Jae Seok is 2, Jong Kook is 1.)

1429
00:49:56.239 --> 00:49:58.150
He doesn't even like it.

1430
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.750
He doesn't even want any.

1431
00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.650
I got number one.

1432
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:04.349
I was only thinking about their age.

1433
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:05.349
I didn't care which number I would pick,

1434
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:06.590
but it turned out to be one.

1435
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.489
Jong Kook is good at guessing the age.

1436
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.560
Let's pick one person.

1437
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.929
If it's 28, all of us get to eat.

1438
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.199
I bet the owner is 28.

1439
00:50:14.199 --> 00:50:16.500
- The person on the right. - They could be...

1440
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.969
31 years old.

1441
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.139
Pick the woman in the middle.

1442
00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:22.170
Let's pick the one in the middle.

1443
00:50:22.739 --> 00:50:24.170
She seems 27 years old.

1444
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:25.369
(She appears to be 27.)

1445
00:50:25.369 --> 00:50:27.070
She's in her early 20s.

1446
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:29.139
- She's in her early 20s. - She's in her early or mid 20s.

1447
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:32.380
I pick the man on the left.

1448
00:50:33.009 --> 00:50:36.150
(He seems to be in the late 20s or 30s.)

1449
00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:38.849
- Let's pick the one on the right. - It could be...

1450
00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:40.449
- Could he be in his 30s? - By the way,

1451
00:50:40.449 --> 00:50:42.420
I'm sorry for barging in like this.

1452
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.989
We apologize.

1453
00:50:43.989 --> 00:50:46.730
Which person shall we pick?

1454
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.000
Let's pick the woman.

1455
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.529
The one in the middle.

1456
00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:50.560
- I agree. - Me too.

1457
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.699
- Me too. - Do you want to choose?

1458
00:50:51.699 --> 00:50:54.199
Based on majority vote, you choose the woman.

1459
00:50:54.199 --> 00:50:55.540
(They pick the woman.)

1460
00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.739
How old are you?

1461
00:50:57.469 --> 00:50:59.070
- Is she in her early 20s? - How old are you?

1462
00:51:00.909 --> 00:51:02.040
(Tangsuyuk depends on her age.)

1463
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.480
If it's 28, all of us get to eat.

1464
00:51:03.509 --> 00:51:05.310
(Tangsuyuk depends on her age.)

1465
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:06.349
How old are you?

1466
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:08.579
(How old could she be?)

1467
00:51:08.579 --> 00:51:09.849
I'm 33 years old.

1468
00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:12.150
(She's in her early 30s.)

1469
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:13.290
I'm 33 years old.

1470
00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:16.989
See? She's 33.

1471
00:51:16.989 --> 00:51:18.060
(Four members fail to eat.)

1472
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.759
She's as old as you.

1473
00:51:19.759 --> 00:51:20.860
Does Jae Seok get to eat?

1474
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.429
(The three get to eat.)

1475
00:51:23.429 --> 00:51:24.630
We're the first three.

1476
00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:26.500
- We're the first three. - Does he get to eat?

1477
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:27.639
It's the three of us.

1478
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:31.139
(33 years is the best age.)

1479
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.610
She looks very young.

1480
00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.739
- I thought you were in your teens. - I thought she was 26.

1481
00:51:34.739 --> 00:51:35.810
(Did you think I was in my late 20s?)

1482
00:51:37.079 --> 00:51:38.250
What about the man on the right?

1483
00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:40.210
- Pardon? - I'm 37 years old.

1484
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.179
(He's 37 years old. That was close.)

1485
00:51:43.179 --> 00:51:44.590
We should have picked him.

1486
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.650
(He could have gotten his first meal.)

1487
00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:47.860
How old are you?

1488
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.690
- I'm 19 years old. - 19?

1489
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.889
(You should have picked me.)

1490
00:51:52.889 --> 00:51:54.799
- He's 19. - 19?

1491
00:51:54.799 --> 00:51:56.230
- Is he 19 years old? - 19?

1492
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.299
- He's a senior in high school. - Who?

1493
00:51:57.299 --> 00:51:58.529
(He could have made everyone eat.)

1494
00:51:58.529 --> 00:52:00.730
He's a senior in high school.

1495
00:52:00.869 --> 00:52:02.199
He's 19 years old!

1496
00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:04.810
(He wasn't 33 years old!)

1497
00:52:04.869 --> 00:52:06.770
I had a chance to eat too.

1498
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:07.810
You picked her.

1499
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.110
I said to pick the man!

1500
00:52:09.279 --> 00:52:10.739
I told you that he looked young.

1501
00:52:11.009 --> 00:52:12.980
I told you that he seemed young.

1502
00:52:13.449 --> 00:52:14.650
Even I could have eaten.

1503
00:52:14.719 --> 00:52:17.949
- Anyway, we get to eat. - Let's eat.

1504
00:52:19.049 --> 00:52:20.549
I already have two badges.

1505
00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:23.659
I had nothing to eat for hours.

1506
00:52:23.659 --> 00:52:24.690
(Each of them gets a badge.)

1507
00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:25.960
For how many people is it?

1508
00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.460
- It's for 1 person. - 1 person?

1509
00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.730
- Is it this much? - Really?

1510
00:52:28.759 --> 00:52:29.929
It's a lot.

1511
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.099
- It's freshly fried. - Right.

1512
00:52:32.099 --> 00:52:33.429
- Really? - It smells amazing.

1513
00:52:33.429 --> 00:52:34.540
The portion is generous.

1514
00:52:35.139 --> 00:52:37.469
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

1515
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.570
(He takes a bite.)

1516
00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:40.980
(It only costs 1.5 dollars.)

1517
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.040
Is it delicious?

1518
00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:43.380
It's very good.

1519
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.509
- It only costs 1.5 dollars. - It's really delicious.

1520
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.679
(They're about to pass out.)

1521
00:52:49.679 --> 00:52:50.750
It's really delicious.

1522
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:53.590
Give me a piece.

1523
00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:54.619
I gave you some.

1524
00:52:54.619 --> 00:52:55.619
I'm so tired.

1525
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:57.320
(He's desperate.)

1526
00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.060
- It's because I'm tired. - Bring your dish.

1527
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.329
Look at my eyes.

1528
00:53:01.329 --> 00:53:02.400
(They complain about hunger.)

1529
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.400
Look at Haha.

1530
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:06.230
(Will So Min get a bite?)

1531
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:07.369
No, it's okay.

1532
00:53:07.369 --> 00:53:08.540
- It's really good. - It's okay.

1533
00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:11.509
(Did she really refuse?)

1534
00:53:11.509 --> 00:53:12.639
It's okay.

1535
00:53:12.639 --> 00:53:14.210
(Is she refusing a bite?)

1536
00:53:15.139 --> 00:53:20.610
(So Min loves to steal other people's food.)

1537
00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:21.719
It's really good.

1538
00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.619
- What's going on? - What's happening?

1539
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:26.790
What's going on?

1540
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.489
- What's happening? - What's going on?

1541
00:53:28.489 --> 00:53:29.759
(The other table gets tangsuyuk.)

1542
00:53:29.759 --> 00:53:30.829
That's not right.

1543
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.929
It's because...

1544
00:53:32.929 --> 00:53:33.929
(You didn't know, did you?)

1545
00:53:33.929 --> 00:53:35.230
- The pork cutlet is... - What are you doing?

1546
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:36.259
What's going on?

1547
00:53:36.259 --> 00:53:37.829
You should win to eat.

1548
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:40.199
Pork cutlet costs 2.5 dollars.

1549
00:53:40.199 --> 00:53:41.599
We have enough money to eat it.

1550
00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:42.940
- What are you doing? - What's going on?

1551
00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:46.110
If we spend more, imagine what will happen to you.

1552
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.480
If we spend more, imagine what will happen to you.

1553
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.810
(He's about to choke.)

1554
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:51.909
I'm about to choke.

1555
00:53:52.279 --> 00:53:54.279
You're not some gangster.

1556
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:56.650
I'm just informing them.

1557
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:57.719
(He gives him a warning.)

1558
00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.119
He's drinking the sauce.

1559
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.860
(He's so hungry that he drinks the sauce.)

1560
00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.029
- Hey. - It's because I'm really hungry.

1561
00:54:06.029 --> 00:54:07.060
Wait a minute.

1562
00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.529
- Se Chan is very hungry. - It's because I like it.

1563
00:54:09.529 --> 00:54:10.630
It's delicious.

1564
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:11.730
Were you that hungry?

1565
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.829
Still, you shouldn't drink the sauce.

1566
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:14.840
It's delicious.

1567
00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.940
- Let's eat pork cutlet. - Let's go.

1568
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.969
Let's go. Shall we go next door?

1569
00:54:18.969 --> 00:54:20.880
- It's right next door. - It's two dollars.

1570
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.009
- Is it right next door? - Yes.

1571
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:23.380
- Thank you. - Let's go.

1572
00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.610
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1573
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:25.650
(We thank the staff.)

1574
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:27.110
It's right next door.

1575
00:54:27.679 --> 00:54:29.949
- We have 2 dollars and 50 cents. - That's great.

1576
00:54:29.949 --> 00:54:30.949
(They take their time.)

1577
00:54:32.119 --> 00:54:33.119
Wait.

1578
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.790
Is it closed?

1579
00:54:37.929 --> 00:54:40.529
(We're on break.)

1580
00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.901
- We're in trouble. - Why?

1581
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.901
- It's closed. - The restaurant is closed.

1582
00:54:46.119 --> 00:54:47.119
Wait.

1583
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.790
Is it closed?

1584
00:54:51.929 --> 00:54:54.529
(We're on break.)

1585
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.901
- We're in trouble. - Why?

1586
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:59.901
- It's closed. - The restaurant is closed.

1587
00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:02.171
- Why did you eat? - Wait.

1588
00:55:02.171 --> 00:55:03.200
(This is bad news.)

1589
00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:07.711
(The pork cutlet restaurant was next door to the tangsuyuk place.)

1590
00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:14.521
(They took their time as they were certain to clear the mission.)

1591
00:55:14.521 --> 00:55:15.821
It's their break time.

1592
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.790
- Right now? - They're preparing.

1593
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.191
Why did you eat without thinking?

1594
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:22.921
(They only have 2.5 dollars left.)

1595
00:55:22.921 --> 00:55:24.231
- It's because of Se Chan. - Didn't you read it?

1596
00:55:24.231 --> 00:55:26.191
Where's the two-dollar place?

1597
00:55:26.191 --> 00:55:27.231
Find it now.

1598
00:55:27.231 --> 00:55:28.560
- Isn't it in Mokdong? - Goodness.

1599
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.131
- Where was it? - Where is it?

1600
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.330
- I saw it. - This is terrible.

1601
00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:34.401
- Didn't you read it? - It's in Hongdae.

1602
00:55:34.401 --> 00:55:35.501
Let's go to Hongdae.

1603
00:55:35.501 --> 00:55:38.071
- Let's go. - Let's go to Hongdae.

1604
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:39.071
Let's hurry.

1605
00:55:39.071 --> 00:55:40.571
- There's one. - Let's just go.

1606
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.010
I'll scold you in the car.

1607
00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:44.350
Let's go.

1608
00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:46.850
- Is it 2.5 dollars? - Yes.

1609
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.321
How could you act out of whim?

1610
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:51.091
I saw how flustered Se Chan was.

1611
00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:52.220
(They head to Hongdae.)

1612
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:53.290
I was so surprised.

1613
00:55:53.751 --> 00:55:55.290
Where is it in Hongdae?

1614
00:55:55.361 --> 00:55:56.390
Call the restaurant.

1615
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:58.131
- Where is it in Hongdae? - It can't be more than 2.5 dollars.

1616
00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:00.930
We almost got in trouble.

1617
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:04.001
No, we're already in trouble.

1618
00:56:04.001 --> 00:56:05.100
We don't have time.

1619
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.901
Turn on the light.

1620
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:08.100
How much time do we have?

1621
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.301
(They have 40 minutes left.)

1622
00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:10.470
How much is the place?

1623
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.810
- It's 2.5 dollars. - Are you sure?

1624
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:14.341
- Yes. - If it's 50 cents more...

1625
00:56:14.341 --> 00:56:15.510
(They fail if it's more than 2.5 dollars.)

1626
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:17.211
If it's 2.8 or 2.9 dollars,

1627
00:56:17.211 --> 00:56:18.981
- it's over. - What is it?

1628
00:56:18.981 --> 00:56:21.580
- Is it more expensive? - There's a 1.9-dollar one.

1629
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:22.981
- Where? - It's in Hongdae.

1630
00:56:22.981 --> 00:56:24.350
Really? Let's go.

1631
00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:27.091
- Is it in Hongdae? - Is it an old price?

1632
00:56:27.091 --> 00:56:28.821
The blog post was written...

1633
00:56:28.821 --> 00:56:29.890
- It's this year. - It was posted...

1634
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:31.231
- No, it's last year. - in September 2017.

1635
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:33.591
- It's served with kkakdugi. - That's great.

1636
00:56:33.591 --> 00:56:34.801
I want some kkakdugi.

1637
00:56:34.801 --> 00:56:35.861
(They head for the pork cutlet.)

1638
00:56:36.301 --> 00:56:39.700
(They arrive at the restaurant in 25 minutes.)

1639
00:56:40.941 --> 00:56:42.700
Even noodles cost three dollars.

1640
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:43.740
(Is this the place?)

1641
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.341
How can pork cutlet cost 1.9 dollars?

1642
00:56:45.771 --> 00:56:48.040
- It's the main street. - It's true.

1643
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.810
Is it okay to shoot?

1644
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.080
Is it okay?

1645
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.350
Is it okay to shoot here?

1646
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:54.781
There's fish cake soup too.

1647
00:56:54.781 --> 00:56:56.781
- We're here to eat pork cutlets. - Hello.

1648
00:56:56.781 --> 00:56:57.950
- Hello. - Hello.

1649
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.251
Does your pork cutlet cost...

1650
00:56:59.251 --> 00:57:01.660
Does it really cost a dollar and 90 cents?

1651
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:05.260
The members have found pork cutlets...

1652
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.801
that cost a dollar and 90 cents per portion.

1653
00:57:07.901 --> 00:57:10.060
How lucky they are.

1654
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.071
(They're so lucky.)

1655
00:57:11.071 --> 00:57:13.071
The owners must be out of their minds.

1656
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.001
Is it even possible?

1657
00:57:15.271 --> 00:57:16.801
Does it really cost only a dollar and 90 cents?

1658
00:57:16.801 --> 00:57:18.271
- Do we just get pork cutlets? - Yes.

1659
00:57:18.271 --> 00:57:20.410
- That's okay. - That's okay.

1660
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:21.941
They must get no profit.

1661
00:57:22.211 --> 00:57:23.810
Noodles cost more than pork cutlets.

1662
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:26.611
(Their pork cutlets cost a dollar less than the noodles.)

1663
00:57:26.611 --> 00:57:29.651
Curry pork cutlet with sauce costs exactly 2 dollars and 50 cents.

1664
00:57:29.651 --> 00:57:31.350
(Curry pork cutlet with sauce)

1665
00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:33.350
Guys, you have to draw a number.

1666
00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.921
- Here we go. - Let's do this.

1667
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.231
If I fail this time too, I'll have starved all day.

1668
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.260
Jong Kook isn't...

1669
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.600
- desperate. - I'm not.

1670
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.470
You shouldn't be desperate if you want to win.

1671
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:45.930
Draw a number...

1672
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:47.540
1, 2, 3.

1673
00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:49.700
- 3. - Mine must be 1.

1674
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.470
- 1, 2, 3. - Unbelievable.

1675
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.341
- I can't believe it. - I picked two.

1676
00:57:53.341 --> 00:57:54.841
1 of the 2...

1677
00:57:54.841 --> 00:57:56.140
(If they're lucky, everyone will get to eat.)

1678
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:57.310
I'm so happy.

1679
00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:01.720
You'll roll an eight-sided dice.

1680
00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:03.251
The number will determine how many can eat?

1681
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:05.251
(They'll roll an eight-sided dice.)

1682
00:58:05.251 --> 00:58:06.720
That's correct.

1683
00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.620
Ma'am, please roll the dice.

1684
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:10.220
Are you ready?

1685
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:11.531
- Ready... - You can do this.

1686
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:13.560
- Please. - We want an eight.

1687
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.531
Please do a good job.

1688
00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.131
- We want an eight. - Please.

1689
00:58:17.131 --> 00:58:18.801
Throw it high.

1690
00:58:19.071 --> 00:58:20.271
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1691
00:58:20.271 --> 00:58:24.370
(They're hungry, and some of them will be penalized soon.)

1692
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:30.481
(The owner will determine who will get pork cutlets.)

1693
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.551
- Wow, two. - Okay.

1694
00:58:32.551 --> 00:58:37.990
(Only 2 people can eat.)

1695
00:58:38.251 --> 00:58:40.521
- Okay. - Two people can eat.

1696
00:58:40.521 --> 00:58:42.361
I haven't eaten anything.

1697
00:58:42.361 --> 00:58:44.760
- What number do you have? - I haven't eaten anything.

1698
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.790
Four.

1699
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.001
- My number is five. - I haven't eaten anything.

1700
00:58:48.001 --> 00:58:49.260
Too bad.

1701
00:58:49.501 --> 00:58:52.071
- We can order curry pork cutlets. - Okay.

1702
00:58:52.071 --> 00:58:53.870
- Two curry pork cutlets? - Yes.

1703
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:54.870
- Two? - Yes.

1704
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:58.040
We have to move to another place.

1705
00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.540
- Okay. - Okay.

1706
00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:01.640
I haven't eaten anything.

1707
00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.841
Is that even possible?

1708
00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:05.450
- Pork cutlets have arrived. - Thank you.

1709
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:06.481
(They'll enjoy the pork cutlets in a park.)

1710
00:59:06.481 --> 00:59:07.850
Thank you.

1711
00:59:07.881 --> 00:59:09.651
Two-dollar pork cutlets.

1712
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:12.921
- They're freshly fried. - Pork cutlets.

1713
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:14.961
- Oh, my. - Look at that.

1714
00:59:15.421 --> 00:59:17.990
This costs two dollars?

1715
00:59:18.591 --> 00:59:20.591
Let me try a piece first.

1716
00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:21.600
- Okay. - Go ahead.

1717
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.001
Let's try it.

1718
00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:24.071
(Impressed)

1719
00:59:24.071 --> 00:59:26.131
- It looks tasty. - It's steaming.

1720
00:59:26.131 --> 00:59:27.131
Does it taste like curry?

1721
00:59:27.131 --> 00:59:28.801
- It tastes good. - It tastes good.

1722
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:32.470
- It's driving me crazy. - Can I try the sauce?

1723
00:59:33.341 --> 00:59:35.140
Se Chan, come here.

1724
00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.841
Okay. I'll be right there.

1725
00:59:38.251 --> 00:59:39.651
- Here. - Thank you.

1726
00:59:40.111 --> 00:59:42.881
(Jong Kook shares his food with others.)

1727
00:59:42.881 --> 00:59:44.021
Thank you.

1728
00:59:45.521 --> 00:59:48.160
(I picked it up on the street.)

1729
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.660
Thank you.

1730
00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.790
Aren't you going to eat?

1731
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.290
Eat.

1732
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:56.260
The one who has accumulated the most Bad Luck Badges...

1733
00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.401
is Se Chan.

1734
00:59:59.501 --> 01:00:04.040
He'll choose one member who will be penalized with him.

1735
01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.470
You know what the penalty is.

1736
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:08.580
You have to take 10,000 steps in dog costumes.

1737
01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.680
You can only walk straight.

1738
01:00:12.211 --> 01:00:14.580
(They'll walk the crowded Hongdae street...)

1739
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.850
(in these costumes.)

1740
01:00:18.551 --> 01:00:22.191
Se Chan, please put this headband on a member.

1741
01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:24.990
(This is hard.)

1742
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.890
I'll put it on from behind.

1743
01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.961
(The Nevis Swing trio and Jae Seok have been excluded.)

1744
01:00:28.961 --> 01:00:30.600
I've been penalized so many times.

1745
01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.801
One...

1746
01:00:31.801 --> 01:00:34.171
(The candidates are Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and So Min.)

1747
01:00:34.171 --> 01:00:35.171
Two...

1748
01:00:35.171 --> 01:00:36.640
(The candidates are Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and So Min.)

1749
01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:42.510
(One of them will take 10,000 steps in a dog costume.)

1750
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080
Three.

1751
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.481
(Who will wear the costume that symbolizes the Year of the Dog?)

1752
01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:55.620
(So Min)

1753
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.160
(Se Chan, you brat.)

1754
01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.660
Good. It's a good choice.

1755
01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:01.631
I was hoping he'd choose So Min.

1756
01:01:01.631 --> 01:01:03.660
So Min has never done anything like this.

1757
01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:07.501
You should try wearing tights. So Min.

1758
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.671
I had to walk next to Kwang Soo when he was wearing a rooster costume.

1759
01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:13.870
(It's no big deal.)

1760
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.881
That's right.

1761
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.781
- Yes. - In the Year of the Rooster.

1762
01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:18.950
Our youngest members will be penalized.

1763
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:20.481
It's been decided.

1764
01:01:21.751 --> 01:01:25.651
(It even starts to snow.)

1765
01:01:25.651 --> 01:01:27.490
- It's snowing. - It's freezing.

1766
01:01:29.321 --> 01:01:31.631
(The dogs,)

1767
01:01:31.631 --> 01:01:35.801
(Se Chan, and So Min are on the street.)

1768
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:40.131
It's like "A Dog of Flanders".

1769
01:01:40.501 --> 01:01:42.841
- You look cute. - You look great.

1770
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:44.071
I love it.

1771
01:01:44.071 --> 01:01:46.140
I'd love to try it.

1772
01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.740
Are you sure? Do you want to switch?

1773
01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.680
- I'd love to try it. - It's freezing.

1774
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:52.410
- So Min, this is amazing. - You look great.

1775
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:53.611
It's hilarious.

1776
01:01:53.611 --> 01:01:55.151
- It's snowing. - Guys.

1777
01:01:55.151 --> 01:01:56.620
We'll give you step counters.

1778
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.720
If you take 5,000 steps for real, you'll have to walk 2.5km.

1779
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.461
- 2.5km? - So just shake your step counter...

1780
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:04.131
while you walk until it says you've taken 5,000 steps.

1781
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:06.231
- Shake it while you walk. - Shake your step counter.

1782
01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:08.600
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1783
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.961
We'll see you next week.

1784
01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:10.970
See you next week.

1785
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:12.370
(We'll see you next week.)

1786
01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:13.870
- Can we go home? - Bye.

1787
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:15.901
Se Chan and So Min, bye.

1788
01:02:15.901 --> 01:02:18.510
- Bye! - Bye!

1789
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:21.540
Se Chan, wait and see.

1790
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.481
I'll get back at you.

1791
01:02:23.481 --> 01:02:25.151
- I'll get back at you next week. - You look great.

1792
01:02:25.151 --> 01:02:26.211
(See you next week.)

1793
01:02:26.211 --> 01:02:27.251
Bye!

1794
01:02:27.251 --> 01:02:28.651
Bye!

1795
01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.950
- We have to walk 2.5km? - Yes.

1796
01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:32.350
Guys, be careful.

1797
01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:34.220
- There you go. - Come here.

1798
01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.390
- You're doing great. - Don't fight.

1799
01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:39.091
- That's my boy. - You're doing a good job.

1800
01:02:39.531 --> 01:02:41.560
- That's my boy. - Look at that.

1801
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.060
What's happening?

1802
01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.071
(People are surprised to see them.)

1803
01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:45.801
Don't take pictures.

1804
01:02:45.801 --> 01:02:46.870
(Embarrassed)

1805
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:48.071
I'm so embarrassed.

1806
01:02:48.771 --> 01:02:50.711
Se Chan, I'm so embarrassed.

1807
01:02:51.611 --> 01:02:55.441
(They became stars on social media that day.)

1808
01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:59.251
(It's Running Man again.)

1809
01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:01.950
Hello, I'm Yang Se Hyung.

1810
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:04.350
(Lying)

1811
01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:06.490
- Hello, I'm Song Ji Hyo. - This is Jeon So Min.

1812
01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:09.260
I'm Song Ji Hyo. Hello.

1813
01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.160
(Sorry. We had no choice.)

1814
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.961
Why are we doing this in Hongdae on a snowy evening?

1815
01:03:17.231 --> 01:03:18.301
You and me...

1816
01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:21.501
(I'm sorry, So Min.)

1817
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:25.310
So Min, we're almost done. We'll walk to Hapjeong-dong.

1818
01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:26.310
(They might walk all the way to Hapjeong-dong.)

1819
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.310
(They're shaking their step counters.)

1820
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:31.850
I'm done!

1821
01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.151
(Finally!)

1822
01:03:34.881 --> 01:03:37.450
- You're lying. - I'm serious.

1823
01:03:38.151 --> 01:03:39.151
I'm done.

1824
01:03:39.251 --> 01:03:40.251
Okay.

1825
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:41.521
You're finished.

1826
01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:43.990
Both of you are finished.

1827
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:45.361
- You can go home now. - Let's go home!

1828
01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:47.260
Let's go. Thank you.

1829
01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.560
Bye.

1830
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.731
You can see it on TV at 4:50pm on Sunday. Thank you.

1831
01:03:52.731 --> 01:03:55.600
(Now, "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" will be revealed.)

1832
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.071
Please watch Running Man.

1833
01:03:57.441 --> 01:04:00.441
I'm so embarrassed.

1834
01:04:00.441 --> 01:04:01.481
(Now, "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" will be revealed.)

1835
01:04:02.341 --> 01:04:04.850
(The shooting starts early in the morning.)

1836
01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:06.211
It's pretty.

1837
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.950
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1838
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:11.521
I see all the costumes are ready.

1839
01:04:12.521 --> 01:04:14.521
I love this. It's perfect.

1840
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.220
Kwang Soo is just a giraffe?

1841
01:04:17.531 --> 01:04:19.160
I should have made him do something else.

1842
01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.490
What a shame.

1843
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.901
I didn't pay so much attention to Kwang Soo.

1844
01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.631
(They start preparing in the waiting room.)

1845
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.001
(Other members arrive.)

1846
01:04:28.001 --> 01:04:29.370
- What are you doing here? - Good morning.

1847
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:31.841
- Good morning. - Is today the day?

1848
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.510
Look at those costumes.

1849
01:04:38.151 --> 01:04:39.680
Is there a catfish costume?

1850
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.251
(Everything is set for you.)

1851
01:04:43.251 --> 01:04:44.450
What is this?

1852
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:46.990
(The costumes have been prepared according to Jae Seok's plan.)

1853
01:04:48.361 --> 01:04:50.260
- This is Seok Jin's. - Yours is here.

1854
01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.760
This is mine? What am I?

1855
01:04:51.861 --> 01:04:55.060
- What are you? - What am I?

1856
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.461
You look like a kid. What am I?

1857
01:04:58.131 --> 01:05:00.271
- You look like a kid. What am I? - You're Toshio.

1858
01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.700
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1859
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.771
- Why do you look so neat? - I won't...

1860
01:05:03.771 --> 01:05:05.640
do anything.

1861
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.711
(Haha's role is...)

1862
01:05:06.711 --> 01:05:08.310
You'll be Toshio.

1863
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:09.481
(Toshio)

1864
01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:14.151
(Toshio is a baby ghost from the movie, "Ju-On".)

1865
01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:15.521
What?

1866
01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:16.651
(Jae Seok put a lot of thought into it.)

1867
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.120
You said you wanted to be something funny.

1868
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:20.390
You said you were tired of penguins.

1869
01:05:20.551 --> 01:05:21.591
Is this mine?

1870
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.021
What? Yes. It's a catfish.

1871
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.160
This doesn't look like a catfish.

1872
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.790
I know. What happened?

1873
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.700
I'm a man.

1874
01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.430
(Why does a catfish need a bra?)

1875
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.801
Haha, good morning. Are you Toshio?

1876
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:37.470
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1877
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:39.640
- Your costume is cute. - Go to the next room.

1878
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.580
Se Chan, will you be a mermaid?

1879
01:05:43.111 --> 01:05:44.910
I'm supposed to be a catfish. I'm not sure.

1880
01:05:45.211 --> 01:05:47.111
Why would a catfish wear a bra?

1881
01:05:47.751 --> 01:05:50.151
Are you a female catfish?

1882
01:05:50.151 --> 01:05:52.450
- Are you female? - Yes. I'm a female catfish.

1883
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.450
(He's given up.)

1884
01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:58.160
(They have to wear costumes Jae Seok assigned to them.)

1885
01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.790
It's going to be cold.

1886
01:06:00.631 --> 01:06:02.100
It looks more like a mermaid.

1887
01:06:02.361 --> 01:06:03.861
It does.

1888
01:06:03.861 --> 01:06:04.870
(The silver costume looks garish.)

1889
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.370
I'm a man.

1890
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:10.970
Good morning.

1891
01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:12.571
- Seok Jin is here. - Good morning.

1892
01:06:12.571 --> 01:06:13.841
Good morning.

1893
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:15.341
- Seok Jin, you'll be a beggar. - What?

1894
01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:17.040
(You'll be a beggar.)

1895
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.211
- What? - You'll be a beggar.

1896
01:06:18.211 --> 01:06:20.410
A beggar? Why am I a beggar?

1897
01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.481
A beggar? Good morning.

1898
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:25.251
- Okay. - A beggar.

1899
01:06:25.251 --> 01:06:26.450
Why am I a beggar?

1900
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:27.560
Are you a beggar?

1901
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.620
What is this?

1902
01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.861
(Why am I a beggar?)

1903
01:06:30.961 --> 01:06:33.861
(He bet all his money that Jong Kook and Ji Hyo weren't together.)

1904
01:06:33.861 --> 01:06:37.870
(Many viewers said they wanted to see him broke.)

1905
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.071
(Jae Seok decided to grant their wish.)

1906
01:06:40.231 --> 01:06:43.740
I'm a beggar? What are you?

1907
01:06:43.771 --> 01:06:44.810
A catfish.

1908
01:06:45.271 --> 01:06:46.410
(He's no better.)

1909
01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:47.640
I'm a female catfish.

1910
01:06:47.981 --> 01:06:50.281
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1911
01:06:51.281 --> 01:06:52.450
It's so noisy.

1912
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.151
(Jong Kook comes in.)

1913
01:06:54.151 --> 01:06:55.251
Hello.

1914
01:06:55.251 --> 01:06:56.720
- Hello. - He's here.

1915
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.091
- Jong Kook... - Your costume is a cat.

1916
01:06:59.091 --> 01:07:01.691
- I'm a cat. - It's pink.

1917
01:07:01.691 --> 01:07:03.191
- It's cute. - It is.

1918
01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.791
I like cute things.

1919
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:06.531
It's cute.

1920
01:07:06.531 --> 01:07:08.130
I'm a cat.

1921
01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.170
- I'm glad you like it. - It's cute.

1922
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.771
It looks like you're shooting a finance commercial.

1923
01:07:15.771 --> 01:07:18.911
- I tried to look normal. - It's like a finance commercial.

1924
01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:20.371
You look trustworthy.

1925
01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:22.640
(Ji Hyo arrives.)

1926
01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.781
What's this?

1927
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:26.111
No way.

1928
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:28.220
(Goodness)

1929
01:07:29.121 --> 01:07:31.191
(This can't be.)

1930
01:07:31.191 --> 01:07:32.590
Ji Hyo, that's you.

1931
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.090
- Am I No-Face? - Yes, you are.

1932
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.991
- I'm No-Face? - Yes.

1933
01:07:35.991 --> 01:07:37.630
- What is wrong with you? - Aren't you happy?

1934
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:38.930
You're No-Face.

1935
01:07:39.491 --> 01:07:41.430
(No-Face is a character in Japanese animation.)

1936
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:43.600
(It has an oval face with dark eye makeup.)

1937
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.201
- You need to... - What's this?

1938
01:07:45.201 --> 01:07:47.840
do makeup like No-Face, okay?

1939
01:07:48.441 --> 01:07:51.071
You're No-Face. I thought hard...

1940
01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:53.670
to make you look funny and settled on this.

1941
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:55.411
- You're No-Face. - Seriously.

1942
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.180
- She's No-Face. - No way.

1943
01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.010
I had no idea.

1944
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.621
I'm a man. Why do I have to dress as a woman?

1945
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.451
- You're here. - Just do it.

1946
01:08:06.651 --> 01:08:08.220
- Hey. - Just do it.

1947
01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.960
(He makes everybody laugh.)

1948
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.291
What are you supposed to be?

1949
01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:14.600
I'm supposed to be a catfish.

1950
01:08:15.701 --> 01:08:17.100
Why do I look like a cutlassfish?

1951
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.401
You're a female catfish. Why are your shoulders so wide?

1952
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:20.840
Hey.

1953
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.800
You don't need to put any makeup on.

1954
01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.941
You look like a catfish.

1955
01:08:23.941 --> 01:08:25.271
You do.

1956
01:08:25.271 --> 01:08:27.441
(He already looks like a catfish with his face alone.)

1957
01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:30.210
- Hello. - Hello.

1958
01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.151
- Come on over, Kwang Soo. - Hello.

1959
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.451
- Hi, Haha. - Hi.

1960
01:08:33.451 --> 01:08:35.121
- Kwang Soo. - Get changed, giraffe.

1961
01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.350
- Kwang Soo... - What's this?

1962
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:39.050
needs some makeup too.

1963
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:40.321
That's you today.

1964
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.560
- That's me? - How do I put this on?

1965
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.691
Yes, it's you.

1966
01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:45.090
Hurry, Kwang Soo.

1967
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.000
If you don't want to do it, you can win.

1968
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.201
- Okay. - Sure.

1969
01:08:50.201 --> 01:08:52.031
Let's play another round.

1970
01:08:52.031 --> 01:08:53.731
- All right. - What?

1971
01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.941
It looks good.

1972
01:08:56.941 --> 01:08:58.541
You look so scary.

1973
01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:01.140
Is this Toshio?

1974
01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.611
Am I just a person next to the homeless person?

1975
01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.550
It looks good.

1976
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:11.050
What's this? Goodness.

1977
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:13.321
- It's good. Good. - Where are you?

1978
01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:15.060
Let's play another round.

1979
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:16.991
Let's play another round.

1980
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.361
Just another round.

1981
01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.630
I'm so mad.

1982
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:23.201
(He gets up.)

1983
01:09:23.831 --> 01:09:25.231
How tall am I?

1984
01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.541
I'm too tall.

1985
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.771
You have to put makeup on. Sit down.

1986
01:09:29.771 --> 01:09:30.941
That's so cool.

1987
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:32.871
Let's do another round.

1988
01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:34.541
(He still wants to play another round.)

1989
01:09:34.541 --> 01:09:37.710
Another round. I mean it. Please?

1990
01:09:37.981 --> 01:09:40.050
I just remembered what I could dress Jae Seok as.

1991
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.180
I can't say it now because he may not do it.

1992
01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.451
Let's play another round.

1993
01:09:44.521 --> 01:09:47.050
- Am I an alien? - One more time.

1994
01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.260
I'm not a catfish.

1995
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.521
- You can't. - Let's play another round.

1996
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:52.960
Why am I female?

1997
01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.401
Why am I female? Why?

1998
01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.670
What's this?

1999
01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.170
I have a fear of heights.

2000
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.340
(Shaking)

2001
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.840
(He's wobbly.)

2002
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:06.670
Can you catch Kwang Soo in the camera?

2003
01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:08.081
You have to.

2004
01:10:08.081 --> 01:10:10.411
Ji Hyo likes her No-Face costume.

2005
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.310
It's a giraffe.

2006
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:13.951
I'm not a giraffe.

2007
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:15.821
He ate it.

2008
01:10:15.821 --> 01:10:18.250
Everybody is happy.

2009
01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:20.521
It looked like I was feeding a real giraffe.

2010
01:10:21.861 --> 01:10:23.991
Eat, giraffe.

2011
01:10:23.991 --> 01:10:25.260
Who told you to win?

2012
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.401
(It's a giraffe that eats gimbap.)

2013
01:10:29.401 --> 01:10:31.231
The giraffe almost ate my hand.

2014
01:10:33.331 --> 01:10:34.771
- Let me ask you for a favor. - What is it?

2015
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.500
Can you change the lightbulb?

2016
01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.741
You're going to fall.

2017
01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:43.241
I'm relieved.

2018
01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:44.911
They're so happy.

2019
01:10:45.651 --> 01:10:47.451
I knew they'd like it.

2020
01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:48.481
(While they have fun,)

2021
01:10:48.481 --> 01:10:51.090
(the set is being prepared.)

2022
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:55.321
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals", directed by Jae Seok)

2023
01:10:55.621 --> 01:11:00.531
(How will the set look?)

2024
01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:04.970
- It's because I'm wearing this. - Really?

2025
01:11:05.031 --> 01:11:06.630
It's because of this.

2026
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:09.441
Seok Jin is naturally funny.

2027
01:11:09.571 --> 01:11:11.970
- He's totally transformed. - The makeup was done perfectly.

2028
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:13.241
Thank you.

2029
01:11:14.411 --> 01:11:16.510
(He's a homeless person.)

2030
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:17.651
What?

2031
01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.380
It doesn't look like you put makeup on.

2032
01:11:19.451 --> 01:11:20.981
- Gosh. - I'm serious.

2033
01:11:20.981 --> 01:11:22.581
Of course, this is my makeup.

2034
01:11:22.581 --> 01:11:23.781
Did you see what he did?

2035
01:11:23.781 --> 01:11:25.621
- "Gosh". - You punk.

2036
01:11:26.021 --> 01:11:27.151
"You punk".

2037
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.861
(The trophy goes in the can.)

2038
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:30.021
I need to find it.

2039
01:11:30.191 --> 01:11:32.130
It's Top Excellence Award.

2040
01:11:32.361 --> 01:11:33.661
Gosh.

2041
01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.731
Jee Seok Jin of Running Man.

2042
01:11:37.731 --> 01:11:43.340
(He received the award last month.)

2043
01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.340
(It's the irony of fate.)

2044
01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:48.210
Why is my nose runny?

2045
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:49.411
Do homeless people have runny noses?

2046
01:11:49.441 --> 01:11:51.880
- I don't think so. - It's cold.

2047
01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.411
Why do I have a runny nose?

2048
01:11:53.411 --> 01:11:54.581
And...

2049
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.491
we haven't started yet,

2050
01:11:57.491 --> 01:11:59.151
so don't run around too much. Stay still.

2051
01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:02.390
- Okay? - I'm not running around.

2052
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:04.231
- I'm staying still. - Don't run around.

2053
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.331
(Fidgeting)

2054
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.331
And Seok Jin.

2055
01:12:09.401 --> 01:12:12.000
Stop looking for cameras. Stay still.

2056
01:12:12.831 --> 01:12:14.840
My feet are frozen.

2057
01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:16.470
You're a parrot.

2058
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:17.640
Thank you.

2059
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.571
(At that moment)

2060
01:12:24.151 --> 01:12:26.810
- You look great. - That looks great, Ji Hyo.

2061
01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:29.880
(Ta-da)

2062
01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:31.550
- Leave it that way. - Leave it.

2063
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:32.791
She looks great.

2064
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:34.021
Don't touch her.

2065
01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:35.260
It looks perfect.

2066
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:36.521
It does?

2067
01:12:36.521 --> 01:12:38.531
(She looks exactly like No-Face. The actress has transformed.)

2068
01:12:38.531 --> 01:12:39.691
Aren't you happy with it?

2069
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.630
It'll help you get new roles.

2070
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.670
(She can act more characters now.)

2071
01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:51.271
(She puts the costume on.)

2072
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:54.541
(She claps for herself.)

2073
01:12:56.441 --> 01:13:00.880
(She's put on many costumes before,)

2074
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.781
(but this one is the best.)

2075
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.951
(She comes in.)

2076
01:13:06.951 --> 01:13:08.161
You scared me.

2077
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.260
- I was startled. - You look great, Ji Hyo.

2078
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:13.090
- That scared me. - It's No-Face.

2079
01:13:13.191 --> 01:13:15.130
- Goodness. - You really scared me.

2080
01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:16.361
(She has everybody's attention.)

2081
01:13:16.361 --> 01:13:17.571
It looks great.

2082
01:13:17.571 --> 01:13:20.401
- This is so funny. - Ji Hyo.

2083
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:22.000
Kwang Soo looks cool.

2084
01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.041
- Who? - Kwang Soo.

2085
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.710
He looks like a character from "Cats".

2086
01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:28.741
I do look cool. I like this.

2087
01:13:29.611 --> 01:13:30.810
For his nose...

2088
01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:32.411
Can you let...

2089
01:13:32.411 --> 01:13:34.050
- Se Chan do this? - Do this.

2090
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:35.350
- Let him do it. - It's okay.

2091
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:37.050
- Would you like to try? - Ma'am.

2092
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:39.791
Don't give up on me. Please.

2093
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:41.760
Do this for the nose.

2094
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.890
(Leave me to it.)

2095
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:44.291
- Is that white? - Yes.

2096
01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:46.861
I'll do the outline.

2097
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:50.031
- Why? Just do it. - No, this is right.

2098
01:13:50.531 --> 01:13:53.470
(Let me see.)

2099
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.640
(It goes like this.)

2100
01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.640
All right. You have to do that on the nose.

2101
01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.140
- This is meticulous. - Right.

2102
01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:05.651
- See? It's better. - That's good.

2103
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.021
You are happy about it.

2104
01:14:08.151 --> 01:14:09.321
Aren't you happy it looks good?

2105
01:14:09.321 --> 01:14:11.621
- This is it. - Right?

2106
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:13.691
That's what we want.

2107
01:14:15.161 --> 01:14:19.460
(The expert and Se Chan work passionately together.)

2108
01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.231
(The giraffe makeup is complete.)

2109
01:14:22.231 --> 01:14:23.460
Thank you.

2110
01:14:25.371 --> 01:14:27.640
(He gets up.)

2111
01:14:31.611 --> 01:14:33.670
(Sighing)

2112
01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:39.010
(He puts the giraffe head on.)

2113
01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:41.180
You've never been a giraffe to this level, right?

2114
01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:43.081
You're a perfect giraffe.

2115
01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:46.220
- He looks great. - You never did it to this level.

2116
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.621
He thinks Kwang Soo looks great.

2117
01:14:47.621 --> 01:14:48.791
(He looks biologically giraffe.)

2118
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:50.590
Can you do it up to here?

2119
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:51.791
Let's take a picture.

2120
01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:55.500
How am I supposed to do this?

2121
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.161
You're not in the screen.

2122
01:14:57.161 --> 01:14:59.231
- I can't do anything else. - Hold on.

2123
01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:00.970
- Wait. - I can't do this.

2124
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:02.201
I'm coming down.

2125
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:03.371
Come down.

2126
01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:04.810
Let's take...

2127
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:06.771
(Collapsing)

2128
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:08.241
Are you all right?

2129
01:15:09.241 --> 01:15:10.680
(It's dangerous to stand on two feet.)

2130
01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.510
Are you okay? Be careful.

2131
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:14.151
Be careful.

2132
01:15:14.151 --> 01:15:16.481
Be careful, Kwang Soo. Are you okay?

2133
01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:17.791
I just bungee jumped.

2134
01:15:18.021 --> 01:15:19.390
That was so scary.

2135
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.991
(He's petrified.)

2136
01:15:20.991 --> 01:15:22.920
Who did that?

2137
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.390
Don't take pictures.

2138
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:26.090
Don't try to take pictures.

2139
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:27.460
I wanted to commemorate...

2140
01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:28.930
My phone is broken.

2141
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.771
- Is it okay? - It's broken.

2142
01:15:30.771 --> 01:15:32.130
Why did you do this?

2143
01:15:32.271 --> 01:15:34.241
- Is it okay? - This is all I had, and it's gone.

2144
01:15:34.241 --> 01:15:35.371
- Goodness. - Is it okay?

2145
01:15:35.371 --> 01:15:37.710
- I lost everything. - Seok Jin.

2146
01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.571
- His phone is broken. - It is.

2147
01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:40.810
It won't work.

2148
01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:48.121
(So Min, the parrot, shows up.)

2149
01:15:50.521 --> 01:15:56.090
(She's an angry parrot.)

2150
01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.430
I'm angry.

2151
01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.161
I'm angry.

2152
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.531
It looks great.

2153
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.630
- I like the parrot. - She's a parrot.

2154
01:16:05.571 --> 01:16:06.731
Look at the giraffe.

2155
01:16:06.731 --> 01:16:08.640
Are you a giraffe or a lion? What are you?

2156
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.340
- He's a giraffe. - How could you?

2157
01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.970
- I can knock you out. - How is he a lion?

2158
01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:13.340
(This looks like "Fantastic Beasts".)

2159
01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.210
- You look like a duck. - She's a parrot.

2160
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:20.981
(The angry parrot terrorizes the giraffe.)

2161
01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:22.420
Stop it.

2162
01:16:23.451 --> 01:16:24.621
She kicked him.

2163
01:16:24.691 --> 01:16:26.121
Stop it.

2164
01:16:26.121 --> 01:16:27.861
(He can't move by himself.)

2165
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:30.021
I can't move.

2166
01:16:30.021 --> 01:16:32.231
(I was born human.)

2167
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:33.991
What's this? What did I do?

2168
01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:36.630
(Who is this giraffe in the mirror?)

2169
01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:40.271
- Put your shoes on, Jong Kook. - I have shoes?

2170
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.701
I'm sorry, but I wasn't trying to make you look cute.

2171
01:16:42.701 --> 01:16:43.871
I'm so cute.

2172
01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:45.241
I love this.

2173
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:47.741
- Gosh... - He loves it.

2174
01:16:47.741 --> 01:16:50.640
(He's supposed to be a cat, but he looks like Tiger Mask.)

2175
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:54.050
(The members are ready to go.)

2176
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:56.581
I think we are all ready. Let's get moving.

2177
01:16:56.581 --> 01:16:57.720
- Okay, let's go. - Let's go to the set.

2178
01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720
Let's finish this fast.

2179
01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.350
- Hold onto him. Stop eating. - Seok Jin.

2180
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.691
You have to hold him. He can't walk on his own.

2181
01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.630
You've never been a giraffe to this level, right?

2182
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:07.661
(Kwang Soo is a perfect giraffe today.)

2183
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.531
She's a parrot on a roost.

2184
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:13.701
(Jong Kook is a muscular cat.)

2185
01:17:13.701 --> 01:17:16.271
He can be a cat on top of a fireplace.

2186
01:17:18.371 --> 01:17:19.970
Seok Jin needs to hold an empty can.

2187
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:21.281
(Se Chan is a catfish, and Seok Jin is a beggar.)

2188
01:17:22.210 --> 01:17:23.380
(Ji Hyo is No-Face, and Haha is Toshio.)

2189
01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.010
No-Face looks great.

2190
01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:29.481
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals")

2191
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:33.151
- This is yours. - I caught a cat.

2192
01:17:33.151 --> 01:17:34.260
(They're in the studio.)

2193
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.861
What's that?

2194
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:41.361
It looks like we're doing a performance.

2195
01:17:41.731 --> 01:17:43.760
This looks like a performance.

2196
01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.130
Who does this for a TV rating notice?

2197
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:47.500
Who does a TV rating notice like this?

2198
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.140
Why is one shoulder lower than the other?

2199
01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.210
Haha is a bit taller.

2200
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.241
(My crutches are of different heights.)

2201
01:17:54.241 --> 01:17:55.310
It's high.

2202
01:17:55.411 --> 01:17:56.680
Everybody.

2203
01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.210
(He's the main guy today.)

2204
01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:00.210
So Min, go on the roost.

2205
01:18:00.481 --> 01:18:01.981
You are the only one who looks nice.

2206
01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.420
(She fits in 200 percent.)

2207
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.720
So Min.

2208
01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.691
You look like a real bird.

2209
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:10.121
That's so funny.

2210
01:18:10.121 --> 01:18:12.161
I'll put you into places.

2211
01:18:12.161 --> 01:18:13.231
(I'm a real bird.)

2212
01:18:13.231 --> 01:18:15.930
The giraffe goes at the back.

2213
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:16.960
Where?

2214
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.130
Move over.

2215
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:20.430
(He's slow.)

2216
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:23.071
(He's slow.)

2217
01:18:23.071 --> 01:18:25.170
(He's a sad animal with a long torso.)

2218
01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:27.781
- In front of that? - That's good.

2219
01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.140
- Turn around. - Stop going. Turn.

2220
01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.250
(He takes forever.)

2221
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:35.951
- And the cat... - Okay.

2222
01:18:35.951 --> 01:18:37.121
is next to the parrot.

2223
01:18:37.281 --> 01:18:38.951
- Go next to the parrot. - Here?

2224
01:18:38.951 --> 01:18:40.151
- Here? - Yes.

2225
01:18:40.151 --> 01:18:41.420
That's a good seat.

2226
01:18:41.491 --> 01:18:43.720
It's good. I'm in the middle.

2227
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.161
Move. Go away.

2228
01:18:47.161 --> 01:18:48.401
She's too into her role.

2229
01:18:50.201 --> 01:18:51.201
Let me see.

2230
01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:54.041
(He's not into his character yet.)

2231
01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:55.840
(She isn't either.)

2232
01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.911
(He isn't.)

2233
01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:01.941
You have to lie down.

2234
01:19:03.981 --> 01:19:05.451
You have to lie down. You're a catfish.

2235
01:19:05.611 --> 01:19:07.581
- Am I really a catfish? - Yes.

2236
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:09.621
(He keeps on having identity issues.)

2237
01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:10.850
- Your costume... - You can't see me.

2238
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:12.521
wasn't ready.

2239
01:19:14.361 --> 01:19:17.960
Shouldn't the giraffe go in between those two?

2240
01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.161
- Where? - Next to the parrot.

2241
01:19:20.161 --> 01:19:21.300
(That's the spot.)

2242
01:19:22.361 --> 01:19:25.071
(They help him.)

2243
01:19:25.071 --> 01:19:28.970
(It requires a few people to move him.)

2244
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.840
We can do this in five seconds?

2245
01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:35.180
Are there too many people on this side?

2246
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.840
Yes, there are.

2247
01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.250
- Let's go back then. - Jae Seok.

2248
01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:41.981
Stop moving me around.

2249
01:19:41.981 --> 01:19:43.550
There are too many people here.

2250
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:44.850
It's not an easy thing to do.

2251
01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:49.291
The beggar has cookies in his can.

2252
01:19:49.521 --> 01:19:52.191
(Goodness)

2253
01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:54.201
- Take it out. - Why?

2254
01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:55.231
Stop eating.

2255
01:19:55.231 --> 01:19:56.901
- Why do you want to take it out? - What are you doing?

2256
01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.371
- Hey. - Stop eating.

2257
01:19:58.371 --> 01:19:59.470
My trophy.

2258
01:20:00.331 --> 01:20:02.541
- Bring it back. - He put cookies in here.

2259
01:20:02.541 --> 01:20:05.210
- Hey. - It has to be realistic.

2260
01:20:05.611 --> 01:20:08.140
You have to be hungry. Why did you put cookies in there?

2261
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:09.541
My gosh.

2262
01:20:09.541 --> 01:20:10.581
(Don't ruin the atmosphere. Stay still, homeless man.)

2263
01:20:11.481 --> 01:20:13.810
This is good. You two look so cute.

2264
01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:15.750
(Toshio and No-Face)

2265
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.750
(Are we doing this right?)

2266
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:17.920
You guys are so cute.

2267
01:20:18.191 --> 01:20:19.521
- What about me? - What?

2268
01:20:19.521 --> 01:20:21.291
- What about me? - Stay still.

2269
01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.090
(This is so sad.)

2270
01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:26.161
Jong Kook looks like Ahn Moon Suk.

2271
01:20:27.831 --> 01:20:29.800
He looks like her from the side.

2272
01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.470
(Who's Ahn Moon Suk from these two?)

2273
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.401
Cat, come here please.

2274
01:20:34.401 --> 01:20:35.401
Where?

2275
01:20:35.401 --> 01:20:37.170
The beggar...

2276
01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:39.941
- is your owner. - I am his?

2277
01:20:39.941 --> 01:20:42.510
(The beggar is your owner.)

2278
01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:44.250
- Okay. - Lie down.

2279
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:46.750
(I am...)

2280
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:49.050
(the cute cat.)

2281
01:20:49.481 --> 01:20:51.590
- Good job. - You met a bad owner.

2282
01:20:52.151 --> 01:20:54.890
Seok Jin is pretending to pat Jong Kook's head.

2283
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:56.021
He's not really touching him.

2284
01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.661
He's pretending.

2285
01:20:57.661 --> 01:20:58.731
(I can't touch this cat.)

2286
01:20:58.731 --> 01:21:01.161
Then I'll come in.

2287
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:03.430
I'll stand here. It's here.

2288
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:05.831
(He wants the camera on him.)

2289
01:21:05.831 --> 01:21:08.401
- Let's not move around. - Sorry?

2290
01:21:08.401 --> 01:21:09.800
Give us some lines.

2291
01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.271
- What lines? - Let us say the age 12 part.

2292
01:21:12.611 --> 01:21:13.771
Okay. I'll give you a line.

2293
01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:15.581
We can say, "12 years and older".

2294
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:17.310
You can make a squawking sound.

2295
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:18.510
Like this?

2296
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:19.850
Say, "rated".

2297
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:21.951
- Rated. - "Rated 12 years and older".

2298
01:21:22.121 --> 01:21:23.920
Rated. Okay?

2299
01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.350
I'll come to the middle.

2300
01:21:26.951 --> 01:21:28.060
Running Man is...

2301
01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.121
- Rated... - Rated...

2302
01:21:29.121 --> 01:21:31.460
12 years and older.

2303
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:32.630
Be louder.

2304
01:21:32.831 --> 01:21:35.031
12 years and older.

2305
01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.371
12 years and older.

2306
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.100
- 12 years and older. - 12 years and older.

2307
01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.500
Stop it.

2308
01:21:41.871 --> 01:21:43.000
Do your job.

2309
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.541
I was teaching her.

2310
01:21:44.541 --> 01:21:47.170
- 12 years and older. - 12 years and older.

2311
01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:49.281
12 years and older. Rated 12 years and older.

2312
01:21:49.281 --> 01:21:50.640
12 years and older.

2313
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.651
(I can do it too.)

2314
01:21:51.651 --> 01:21:52.680
Stop it.

2315
01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.220
- Why are you holding the trophy? - Right?

2316
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.691
Why is his trophy there?

2317
01:21:57.890 --> 01:22:00.590
It's honoring his past.

2318
01:22:00.861 --> 01:22:01.991
Okay?

2319
01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:04.130
Jong Kook, can you go on your knees?

2320
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:06.531
- I can't see your face. Do this. - Okay.

2321
01:22:06.991 --> 01:22:08.201
Lick your hands.

2322
01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:10.500
(I'm an obedient cat.)

2323
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:11.970
You two are great.

2324
01:22:12.170 --> 01:22:14.470
Toshio and No-Face are good.

2325
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:15.470
- What about me? - The giraffe.

2326
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:18.241
You have to make some noise. Do this with your tongue.

2327
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.880
Right.

2328
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880
(Like this?)

2329
01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.680
- Do this. - Do I say something?

2330
01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.050
No, don't do that.

2331
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.911
Stick your tongue out, and act.

2332
01:22:26.911 --> 01:22:28.021
(This is good acting.)

2333
01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.050
I won't come to the center.

2334
01:22:31.951 --> 01:22:33.250
I own this beggar.

2335
01:22:35.121 --> 01:22:36.161
I own this beggar.

2336
01:22:36.291 --> 01:22:37.491
- That looks so scary. - Wait.

2337
01:22:37.491 --> 01:22:39.390
I feel sorry for that beggar.

2338
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:41.460
- What's wrong? - What?

2339
01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.031
Why can't a cat raise a person?

2340
01:22:43.031 --> 01:22:44.071
- Lie on his lap. - Me?

2341
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:45.071
Yes.

2342
01:22:45.371 --> 01:22:47.941
Repeat after Jae Seok.

2343
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:50.340
Say, "Running Man is".

2344
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.611
I'll copy him.

2345
01:22:52.071 --> 01:22:54.810
While you guys are here,

2346
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:56.611
I'll come in.

2347
01:22:56.611 --> 01:22:58.050
Do you have to look so gentle?

2348
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:02.121
- Running Man is... - Running Man is...

2349
01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.321
No.

2350
01:23:03.481 --> 01:23:04.550
Running Man is...

2351
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:05.691
- Rated... - Rated 12 years and older.

2352
01:23:05.691 --> 01:23:07.191
12 years and older. Got it?

2353
01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:09.260
She's copying you because she's a parrot.

2354
01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:12.130
It's not funny.

2355
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.460
Sir, you can do that when you're the director.

2356
01:23:15.701 --> 01:23:17.630
Let's do this again.

2357
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:19.000
Let's do it again.

2358
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.100
I'm so mad!

2359
01:23:20.401 --> 01:23:22.271
What if I win again?

2360
01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:23.371
My gosh.

2361
01:23:23.371 --> 01:23:25.441
Keep doing that, So Min.

2362
01:23:25.441 --> 01:23:26.970
Keep doing that.

2363
01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:29.241
Let's practice. This is the last time.

2364
01:23:29.781 --> 01:23:30.781
Ready.

2365
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.521
- It's good. - Let's go.

2366
01:23:34.821 --> 01:23:37.521
(They've practiced.)

2367
01:23:37.521 --> 01:23:38.991
(They're absorbed in their roles.)

2368
01:23:38.991 --> 01:23:42.590
(Let's show our great acting skills.)

2369
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:45.231
- Sorry. I need to use the bathroom. - Jae Seok.

2370
01:23:45.231 --> 01:23:47.800
(Excuse me.)

2371
01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.060
Jae Seok.

2372
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.060
Why do you need to use the bathroom?

2373
01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.130
I'll be back.

2374
01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.000
Why all of a sudden?

2375
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:54.771
Does he have a mission to complete?

2376
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.300
Is this a mission or something?

2377
01:23:57.911 --> 01:23:59.411
I'm getting dizzy.

2378
01:24:01.441 --> 01:24:03.880
(Chuckling)

2379
01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.521
(She's satisfied with how she looks.)

2380
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.691
- This looks good. - We can't get...

2381
01:24:11.691 --> 01:24:12.691
solo shots, right?

2382
01:24:12.691 --> 01:24:13.750
You have a good spot.

2383
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:15.590
- We're in the background, right? - Yes.

2384
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:16.960
- Running Man is... - Hey.

2385
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.890
When Jae Seok says his line, let's jump in.

2386
01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:22.861
You can't do that.

2387
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:28.600
It won't take long. Let's go in one try.

2388
01:24:28.701 --> 01:24:30.741
Let's do it twice and pick the better one.

2389
01:24:32.071 --> 01:24:34.310
Let's practice. Let's go.

2390
01:24:34.481 --> 01:24:35.640
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2391
01:24:35.981 --> 01:24:37.010
Let's go.

2392
01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:40.981
Running Man is...

2393
01:24:40.981 --> 01:24:42.081
- Rated... - Rated...

2394
01:24:42.081 --> 01:24:45.291
12 years and older. Jae Seok is stupid.

2395
01:24:45.621 --> 01:24:47.861
(Jae Seok is stupid.)

2396
01:24:48.321 --> 01:24:49.760
Don't do that.

2397
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:51.691
- Don't do that. - That was good.

2398
01:24:51.691 --> 01:24:52.831
Hey, don't do that.

2399
01:24:53.191 --> 01:24:54.401
You call that improvisation?

2400
01:24:54.531 --> 01:24:55.701
She's a drunk parrot.

2401
01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:59.100
Let's go twice.

2402
01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:02.170
Flap your wings as if you're flying.

2403
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.741
You have a big role, So Min. I'm jealous.

2404
01:25:05.741 --> 01:25:07.481
- You get to flap your wings. - She's the main character.

2405
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:09.010
I have a big role.

2406
01:25:09.441 --> 01:25:11.411
Jong Kook, lick your hand.

2407
01:25:11.411 --> 01:25:13.050
You're sticking your tongue out, right?

2408
01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:14.821
No-Face and Toshio.

2409
01:25:14.821 --> 01:25:15.821
- I'm doing it. - Good.

2410
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.220
And... Hey.

2411
01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:20.791
(What?)

2412
01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.521
Why are you playing the lobster?

2413
01:25:23.621 --> 01:25:25.130
I have to do something.

2414
01:25:25.791 --> 01:25:27.361
This is a lonely spot.

2415
01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:30.401
- I don't know what you are. - Me neither.

2416
01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:32.670
- Are you a catfish or a mermaid? - I don't know.

2417
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:33.871
You're an alien.

2418
01:25:34.041 --> 01:25:35.100
Let's go.

2419
01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.500
I should play this.

2420
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.041
- Let's go. - You'll make noise.

2421
01:25:38.041 --> 01:25:39.741
Don't play that.

2422
01:25:39.871 --> 01:25:42.310
- You'll make noise. Stay still. - Let me do it.

2423
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:44.050
- Stay still. - Goodness.

2424
01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:45.750
Do what I tell you to do.

2425
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:47.781
Why do you have so many ambitions?

2426
01:25:47.781 --> 01:25:49.521
I thought I was supposed to hit this.

2427
01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:51.550
- I'm sorry. - Put it down.

2428
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:52.951
Don't do it.

2429
01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:58.731
(While the three members argue,)

2430
01:25:58.731 --> 01:26:00.260
(they are forgotten.)

2431
01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:01.331
Seok Jin.

2432
01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:06.331
- Put it down. - Don't do it.

2433
01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:08.571
You scumbag of a beggar!

2434
01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:11.241
- Stop it. - I'm sorry.

2435
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:13.541
- Finish it. - Stop it.

2436
01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:14.680
Hurry.

2437
01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:16.880
Why are you hitting me?

2438
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.010
(Too much greed makes the other members mad.)

2439
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.151
- Why do I have this then? - Don't be greedy.

2440
01:26:21.151 --> 01:26:22.720
- Fine. - Don't be greedy.

2441
01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.750
- This is a TV rating notice. - Put it down.

2442
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:26.991
Viewers don't expect anything from you,

2443
01:26:27.491 --> 01:26:29.321
- so don't do it. - It's mine.

2444
01:26:29.321 --> 01:26:31.460
Don't do it. Put this inside.

2445
01:26:32.161 --> 01:26:34.430
This is symbolic. Leave it alone.

2446
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:36.201
- Go. - Leave it inside.

2447
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:37.231
It's mine!

2448
01:26:37.231 --> 01:26:39.470
- That stupid beggar. - Hurry up.

2449
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:42.170
- Get out. Come here. - Hurry.

2450
01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:43.201
(They wrestle with each other.)

2451
01:26:43.201 --> 01:26:44.871
- Don't do it. - Kick him out.

2452
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:46.340
Get out.

2453
01:26:46.441 --> 01:26:47.510
- Don't do it. - Kick him out.

2454
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:49.210
- Fine. - Do as you are told.

2455
01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:50.581
- Spray salt on him. - Gosh.

2456
01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:52.880
- What are you doing? - He's a tyrant.

2457
01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:54.781
Do as you are told, everybody.

2458
01:26:54.781 --> 01:26:56.281
That's the only way we will get done quickly.

2459
01:26:56.281 --> 01:26:57.750
- Let's do two takes. - Okay.

2460
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:59.390
Here we go. Cue.

2461
01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:00.791
(They calm down.)

2462
01:27:02.991 --> 01:27:04.021
Running Man is...

2463
01:27:04.021 --> 01:27:05.331
- Rated... - Rated...

2464
01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:08.460
12 years and older.

2465
01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.300
You blocked out the words.

2466
01:27:10.331 --> 01:27:11.670
His timing was off, too.

2467
01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:14.371
- You blocked out my voice. - He said the words a bit late.

2468
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.970
- You blocked out my voice. - He said the words a bit late.

2469
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:18.470
This is a festival.

2470
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:21.411
- Festival, my foot! - It's a festival.

2471
01:27:21.411 --> 01:27:23.210
The audio...

2472
01:27:23.210 --> 01:27:24.951
(Kicking)

2473
01:27:24.951 --> 01:27:26.781
You blocked out the audio.

2474
01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:27.981
No-Face is angry.

2475
01:27:28.121 --> 01:27:29.380
No-Face, are you okay?

2476
01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.621
Do it right.

2477
01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:31.850
All right.

2478
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:34.861
You blocked out So Min's voice.

2479
01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:38.231
Don't beat the empty can. Take it from him.

2480
01:27:38.231 --> 01:27:39.231
Hey.

2481
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.861
- Why are you coming this way? - He is exhausted.

2482
01:27:42.861 --> 01:27:43.861
(Kicking)

2483
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800
Hey.

2484
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800
(Kicking)

2485
01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.340
What do you think you are doing?

2486
01:27:48.941 --> 01:27:50.840
- Seok Jin. - All right. All right.

2487
01:27:51.071 --> 01:27:53.170
I want to get off this thing.

2488
01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:54.411
All right. I won't beat the empty can.

2489
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.340
I am feeling dizzy.

2490
01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:59.180
I need some anxiety-relieving pills.

2491
01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:02.281
It's a festival. I did it because it's a festival.

2492
01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.521
This will be our last take.

2493
01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:08.220
I am not the type to shoot for long. I work quickly.

2494
01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:09.460
- Okay. - We only need five seconds.

2495
01:28:10.021 --> 01:28:12.390
- It's shaped like a heart. - Stop it.

2496
01:28:13.691 --> 01:28:15.831
Let's go. Position your hands.

2497
01:28:17.161 --> 01:28:18.831
- Let's go. - Your hair is flying in the air.

2498
01:28:19.371 --> 01:28:20.800
I can't make you go flying in the air.

2499
01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.500
(What can I do?)

2500
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.541
(I guess you are right.)

2501
01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:28.741
Focus. This is the last take.

2502
01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:31.210
(For the last time, action.)

2503
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:32.850
Running Man is...

2504
01:28:32.951 --> 01:28:34.050
- Rated... - Rated...

2505
01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:38.021
12 years and older. Jae Seok is an utter jerk!

2506
01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:40.590
- So Min! - What are you doing?

2507
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:41.920
You utter jerk!

2508
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:44.560
Can't you do it right?

2509
01:28:44.661 --> 01:28:46.260
Hey!

2510
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.800
(There goes what was supposed to be our last take.)

2511
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.960
- What are you doing? - I got so angry.

2512
01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.130
I was too angry.

2513
01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:52.970
This is a TV rating notice for 12 years and older.

2514
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:55.041
What exactly is our problem?

2515
01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:56.541
Why can't we finish it?

2516
01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:58.571
Let me take off my shoes!

2517
01:28:59.071 --> 01:29:00.640
I feel nauseous.

2518
01:29:01.941 --> 01:29:04.710
Focus. This is the last take.

2519
01:29:05.210 --> 01:29:08.151
Let's focus. This isn't hard.

2520
01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.850
Your greed is making this hard.

2521
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:12.350
Why do you keep messing it up...

2522
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.821
when there is only one line?

2523
01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:17.430
Look at us siblings from Mapo-gu.

2524
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:19.231
- You are doing well. - We don't try anything.

2525
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:22.800
- Your greed is making this hard. - Stop being greedy.

2526
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.331
Why are you so greedy?

2527
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:26.571
Squash the greed that bubbles up in your heart.

2528
01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:28.970
All of us need to do our part.

2529
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:30.470
Put it down.

2530
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.071
- What? - Put the lobster down.

2531
01:29:33.071 --> 01:29:34.840
This is the last piece of my pride.

2532
01:29:35.481 --> 01:29:37.111
I need this for my pride.

2533
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:38.111
All right.

2534
01:29:38.151 --> 01:29:39.651
It's okay to hold a lobster.

2535
01:29:40.151 --> 01:29:41.151
Let's go.

2536
01:29:42.521 --> 01:29:45.691
This is the last take. You need to do your parts well.

2537
01:29:45.691 --> 01:29:48.260
(With the hope that this'll be the last take, action.)

2538
01:29:48.521 --> 01:29:49.621
Running Man is...

2539
01:29:49.661 --> 01:29:50.691
- Rated... - Rated...

2540
01:29:50.691 --> 01:29:54.531
12 years and older. 12 years and older.

2541
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.701
Why does it sound like she's swearing?

2542
01:29:56.701 --> 01:29:58.970
(Did she just swear?)

2543
01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:00.941
Hold on. Don't repeat it like that.

2544
01:30:00.941 --> 01:30:03.800
- Don't do it. - Don't do it.

2545
01:30:04.871 --> 01:30:06.241
It really sounds a bit...

2546
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:07.880
It sounds like a swear word.

2547
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.441
Let's wrap it up. I think we are getting there.

2548
01:30:10.441 --> 01:30:12.210
- You are doing well, right? - Yes.

2549
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:14.281
Let's go.

2550
01:30:14.281 --> 01:30:17.220
No matter how it goes, this will be our last take.

2551
01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.250
- Okay. - Okay.

2552
01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:19.451
Let's go.

2553
01:30:19.451 --> 01:30:21.321
(The production crew is out of tape.)

2554
01:30:21.321 --> 01:30:22.491
It will air for a month.

2555
01:30:22.491 --> 01:30:23.920
(This time, it's the real one.)

2556
01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:28.531
No matter how it goes, this will be our last take.

2557
01:30:28.531 --> 01:30:29.560
Okay.

2558
01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.571
Cue.

2559
01:30:31.571 --> 01:30:33.031
(Let go of your greed.)

2560
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:35.441
(For the very last time, action.)

2561
01:30:35.441 --> 01:30:36.441
Running Man is...

2562
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:41.941
(We reveal the finished version of "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".)

2563
01:30:41.941 --> 01:30:43.041
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals")

2564
01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:45.781
(You will see this TV rating notice starting from next week.)

2565
01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:47.680
- Running Man is... - Rated...

2566
01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:52.021
