00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.920 line:93%
(Episode 36)

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.659 line:93%
I'm sorry for being late.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.860 line:93%
It's okay. My class ended early.

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.229 line:93%
I rushed a little bit.

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.569 line:93%
Order something that she'd like.

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:25.630 line:93%
It's okay.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.940 line:93%
Let's eat after we finish talking.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.269 line:93%
Okay.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.109 line:93%
How are you? Are you feeling okay?

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.749 line:93%
There are some aftereffects,
but it's okay.

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.179 line:93%
My heart fluttered a little
while coming here...

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.289 line:93%
since you asked me on a date first.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.319 line:93%
I came here to discuss something
about Tae Yang.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.060 line:93%
That's been giving me a headache.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.130 line:93%
I don't know what to do...

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.899 line:93%
because Lee Ru Ri is so persistent.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.730 line:93%
I think we'll find answer today...

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.670 line:93%
about what we should do.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.139 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.740 line:93%
Leave. You are so rude.

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:14.819 line:93%
Wait a minute.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.220 line:93%
I have something to tell you.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.520 line:93%
Please allow me some time.

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:23.059 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.229 line:93%
The guest is leaving. See them out.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.100 line:93%
It's okay.

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:29.259 line:93%
They're my guests.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.669 line:93%
You must have gone through
a lot of trouble to be here.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.580 line:93%
Thank you for giving us the chance.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.610 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.910 line:93%
She gave...

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.619 line:93%
me a call this morning.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.289 line:93%
She wanted to know more about Ru Ri
and asked us to meet.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.259 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.259 line:93%
What is there more to know about her
to make this happen?

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:02.259 line:93%
Isn't what we've found out
about her enough?

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.630 line:93%
Kevin.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.399 line:93%
I don't know what happened...

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.770 line:93%
and how they persuaded you,

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.569 line:93%
but I don't want to know more
or find out more about her.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.379 line:93%
Chairman, look.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.379 line:93%
You told me yourself last time
when you were in my office.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.679 line:93%
You refused this marriage because
it was dirty and cheap.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.320 line:93%
How should I understand you
changing your words...

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.960 line:93%
like this?

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.960 line:93%
The fact that you're saying
different things...

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.189 line:93%
is the proof that
you're not truthful.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.230 line:93%
Wait a minute. Please listen to me.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.599 line:93%
It's...

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.300 line:93%
I'm not saying different things.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.140 line:93%
I can say things differently because
the situation has changed.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.080 line:93%
This all happened
because of a misunderstanding.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.480 line:93%
What is a misunderstanding?

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.580 line:93%
Is it a misunderstanding that your
son broke up with someone...

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.119 line:93%
before marriage all because of you?

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:56.920 line:93%
That's true,
but there's a reason for that.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.849 line:93%
Is it also a misunderstanding that
she became a single mother...

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.559 line:93%
and got locked up in prison?

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.059 line:93%
Chairman, nothing will be solved...

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.499 line:93%
if you keep on picking on
every single thing.

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.599 line:93%
Listen to me first.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.770 line:93%
I don't have time to listen to you.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.700 line:93%
Let's go.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.770 line:93%
Wait a minute. They have gone
through a lot of trouble to be here.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.969 line:93%
Please leave first.

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.809 line:93%
People are watching.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.210 line:93%
What are you doing? Move.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:25.349 line:93%
Wait a minute.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.219 line:93%
Don't move.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.490 line:93%
Honey.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.730 line:93%
I already embarrassed myself.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.129 line:93%
Please excuse me for a little more.

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.700 line:93%
Will you give me some time,

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.070 line:93%
or will you promote your restaurant
with such scene on the Internet?

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.490 line:93%
We're in trouble.

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.890 line:93%
I think that you were right.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.290 line:93%
Jung Hwa Young invited
Lee Ru Ri's parents,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.960 line:93%
and they're having
a face-to-face meeting.

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.099 line:93%
What are they talking
about right now?

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.869 line:93%
Lee Shin Mo is intent on resolving
their misunderstanding.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.869 line:93%
It will be dangerous
if they start talking about it.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.540 line:93%
We have no choice now.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.270 line:93%
We'll have to use the last plan
as expected.

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.510 line:93%
When will Dad return to the company?

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.049 line:93%
3 pm?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.849 line:93%
Okay.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.899 line:93%
Why are you doing this?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.070 line:93%
You've found out enough about
Lee Ru Ri and her family.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.000 line:93%
Why would you make such an
uncomfortable event like this?

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:58.409 line:93%
You're right.

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.539 line:93%
I've found out enough about
Lee Ru Ri.

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.310 line:93%
I even met Jung Su Mi in prison,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.810 line:93%
and I even saw documents about
her after a private investigation.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.180 line:93%
I also heard about everything
that happened in the past...

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.520 line:93%
from the director and Ae Ri.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.020 line:93%
Isn't that enough?
Why do we need to be here?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.760 line:93%
But I haven't heard anything
directly from her.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.089 line:93%
Everything we heard was from
a third party.

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:19.659 line:93%
I wanted to hear it
directly from herself.

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.370 line:93%
That's how you get to know
a person properly.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.070 line:93%
If we hear from her directly, do you
think she will tell us the truth?

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.700 line:93%
She will do anything to marry
Tae Yang.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.299 line:93%
Is it that great...

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.469 line:93%
to be your son?

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.510 line:93%
Honey.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.810 line:93%
What is the exact reason
for opposing my daughter?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.919 line:93%
You're doing this to find a good
match for Tae Yang, right?

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.359 line:93%
That's why I'm opposing like this.

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:47.460 line:93%
How will you take...

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.830 line:93%
responsibility then?

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.799 line:93%
As your wife said, if they break up
despite their true love...

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:56.700 line:93%
because of your misunderstanding,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.930 line:93%
will you take responsibility?

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.000 line:93%
What did you say?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.710 line:93%
To be honest,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.380 line:93%
I was hesitant
about this marriage...

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.080 line:93%
after learning Tae Yang's
background.

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.109 line:93%
Ru Ri's father was also hesitant.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.880 line:93%
But we accepted them
because they were sincere.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.919 line:93%
You might think...

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:22.659 line:93%
that we changed our minds
because of your background.

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:25.589 line:93%
But him being your son
isn't great enough...

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.930 line:93%
to sell my daughter's life.

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.000 line:93%
That's good then.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.770 line:93%
Let's end this since we have
reached an agreement.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.870 line:93%
Chairman.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.810 line:93%
Will you be okay...

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.680 line:93%
with your son living exactly
like you?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.479 line:93%
What?

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.750 line:93%
I heard that you longed for your
loved ones for your entire life...

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:49.250 line:93%
because you made a mistake
and got separated.

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.419 line:93%
Will you be okay with your son
living the exact life as yours...

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.859 line:93%
because of your mistake?

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.760 line:93%
Be careful with your words.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.399 line:93%
I'm enduring you to not let
him live like me.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:10.169 line:93%
Chairman,
please try a little bit harder.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.339 line:93%
We will give up completely...

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:18.549 line:93%
if the misunderstanding isn't
resolved after listening to me.

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:30.159 line:93%
Okay.

00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:32.359 line:93%
The incident at the Guam resort...

00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:34.899 line:93%
is solved by Stephanie
who used to work together.

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:36.969 line:93%
The director of the printing office
said...

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:39.839 line:93%
he would write a statement
about the fake poster.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.239 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri, you're over now.

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.080 line:93%
Myung Rang, I got the data
that the manager asked for.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.210 line:93%
Okay.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.680 line:93%
I've never seen a scarier person
than Joo Ae Ri.

00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:53.419 line:93%
Ru Ri will be okay now, right?

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:54.849 line:93%
Of course.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.820 line:93%
We're also in trouble.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.919 line:93%
Dad wants to meet you.

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.960 line:93%
What? What should we do?

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.330 line:93%
Don't worry.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.399 line:93%
My dad likes humorous people.

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:10.729 line:93%
Try telling me a funny story
as a practice.

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:13.839 line:93%
I'm bad at making people laugh.

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:19.839 line:93%
Ginseng is the best when you harvest
it after six years.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.440 line:93%
When should you harvest
wild ginseng then?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.210 line:93%
When should I harvest it?
After three years?

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.620 line:93%
No, as soon as you see it.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.989 line:93%
Wait a minute. So you have
to harvest it as soon as you see it?

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.760 line:93%
That hurts.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.989 line:93%
I'm sorry. That must have hurt.

00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:43.030 line:93%
I have a habit of slapping people
while laughing.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.469 line:93%
This is funny though. Try again.

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:48.400 line:93%
I don't have any more funny stories.

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:50.310 line:93%
I don't have any more!
No more jokes!

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.509 line:93%
That's not good.
You're going to meet my dad.

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:54.940 line:93%
What about this one?

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:56.450 line:93%
What time is it in India now?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.180 line:93%
I don't know.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.719 line:93%
It's Indonesia.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.150 line:93%
Stop hitting me!

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:09.830 line:93%
Gosh, come on! Tell me more jokes!
Sung Tan!

00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:16.469 line:93%
There's only one way.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.430 line:93%
I'll settle it by tomorrow.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.109 line:93%
You said you'll settle the matter
today. What are you going to do?

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:31.210 line:93%
Let's meet the chairman together
and tell him the truth.

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:40.790 line:93%
This isn't going to be pretty.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.960 line:93%
I don't want you to be involved.

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:46.330 line:93%
I can take care of this.
Just wait until then.

00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:56.040 line:93%
I'll wait for you.
Tell me when you need my help.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.910 line:93%
I don't want to be played
by Joo Ae Ri's tricks.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.889 line:93%
(Joo Ae Ri)

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.030 line:93%
Hello.

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:22.060 line:93%
We should meet today.

00:10:22.359 --> 00:10:24.070 line:93%
I need some answers from you.

00:10:25.469 --> 00:10:28.139 line:93%
What did you say?
How dare you say that to me?

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.540 line:93%
I'm the one who needs answers.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.109 line:93%
That's why we should meet
and discuss this.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.349 line:93%
If you feel wronged, come to
the conference room by three.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.249 line:93%
Hey, Joo Ae Ri! Joo Ae Ri!

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.530 line:93%
Please tell us
what we have misunderstood.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.960 line:93%
All right.
My daughter can tell you herself...

00:10:54.499 --> 00:10:57.369 line:93%
what you have
misunderstood about her.

00:10:57.769 --> 00:11:02.400 line:93%
I'm going to explain
the matter regarding my son.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:07.810 line:93%
Manager Jung gave me the recording,

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:11.379 line:93%
and I listened to
what Su Mi said over 10 times.

00:11:14.349 --> 00:11:15.749 line:93%
Please take a look at this.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.589 line:93%
(Transaction Receipt)

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:26.129 line:93%
(Recipient: Jung Su Mi,
Amount: 50,000 dollars)

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.969 line:93%
(I, Jung Su Mi, promise not to
hold Lee So Won responsible.)

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.700 line:93%
What is this?

00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:38.339 line:93%
After my son started his army duty,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.080 line:93%
she came to visit me.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.680 line:93%
I want to give him a clean break,
but I have a problem.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.979 line:93%
What is the problem?

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:48.280 line:93%
I need money.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.219 line:93%
A lot of money.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.589 line:93%
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

00:11:52.719 --> 00:11:53.960 line:93%
Haven't you figured it out yet?

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.160 line:93%
Why I ordered...

00:11:57.089 --> 00:11:58.729 line:93%
juice instead of coffee?

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:01.960 line:93%
She told me she was pregnant.
She suggested first...

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:06.170 line:93%
that she'd get an abortion
if I pay her 100,000 dollars.

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:13.180 line:93%
I didn't like her anyway,

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:15.979 line:93%
so I accepted her suggestion...

00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:17.810 line:93%
and sent her the money.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.150 line:93%
That's the receipt and memorandum
I received at that time.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.050 line:93%
My goodness.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.460 line:93%
(I, Jung Su Mi, promise not to
hold Lee So Won responsible.)

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:34.960 line:93%
She hadn't contacted us
for all these years.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.900 line:93%
Only a few months ago,

00:12:38.229 --> 00:12:41.570 line:93%
a girl was abandoned
in front of my son's clinic.

00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:44.269 line:93%
What's going on?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.440 line:93%
After her mother went to prison,
she lived in a dump.

00:12:47.739 --> 00:12:51.009 line:93%
The girl's aunt abandoned her
in front of his clinic.

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:54.150 line:93%
My daughter-in-law is sterile,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.389 line:93%
so Su Mi said that we took
her daughter away from her.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.790 line:93%
That is not true either.

00:13:01.859 --> 00:13:04.930 line:93%
Because of the child,
my son was divorced.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.930 line:93%
We are raising the child.

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:12.469 line:93%
Even though we don't like
her mother, we adore the child...

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:15.269 line:93%
perhaps, because
she carries our lineage.

00:13:19.339 --> 00:13:22.609 line:93%
Wait. Then why did that woman...

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.479 line:93%
tell these vicious lies
when she's abandoned her child?

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.790 line:93%
We don't know why she told...

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.820 line:93%
those lies either.

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:35.160 line:93%
It doesn't matter
how disappointed she is.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.830 line:93%
We are raising her daughter
after all.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.700 line:93%
I don't understand
why she'd go that far.

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:43.670 line:93%
At first,
what she did infuriated me.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.769 line:93%
But thinking back,
it's all my fault.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.670 line:93%
You were right, sir.

00:13:51.239 --> 00:13:52.609 line:93%
I did everything in my power...

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.710 line:93%
to make sure my son had
an easy and comfortable life.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.349 line:93%
In a nutshell, I just wanted
my son to live in comfort.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.080 line:93%
But in doing so,
I hurt someone else's daughter.

00:14:03.089 --> 00:14:04.619 line:93%
What goes around comes around.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.889 line:93%
My wife and I...

00:14:07.989 --> 00:14:11.830 line:93%
don't have anything to offer
unlike you, a successful chairman.

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:15.460 line:93%
However, we raised our children
with love to make sure...

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.900 line:93%
they lead an honest life.

00:14:18.999 --> 00:14:20.099 line:93%
I came here...

00:14:21.739 --> 00:14:23.369 line:93%
because I can't stand the fact...

00:14:23.739 --> 00:14:25.739 line:93%
that she's going to live...

00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:29.410 line:93%
the rest of her life with pain
because of my mistake.

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:35.950 line:93%
My hands are tied if you still don't
believe me after my explanation.

00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:42.460 line:93%
If you can understand where
I'm coming from as a parent,

00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:46.999 line:93%
please give your blessing
for my daughter.

00:14:48.999 --> 00:14:52.129 line:93%
Ru Ri lived an ordinary life,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.700 line:93%
but she has the biggest heart.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.639 line:93%
She's thoughtful, cheerful,

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:59.139 line:93%
understanding, and diligent.

00:15:00.109 --> 00:15:04.249 line:93%
Most of all, she loves
Manager Jung with all her heart.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.019 line:93%
About the rumors you heard...

00:15:09.249 --> 00:15:11.119 line:93%
about Ru Ri,

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:16.160 line:93%
please get to the bottom of them...

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.859 line:93%
with Manager Jung and Ru Ri.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.560 line:93%
They will give you clarity.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.599 line:93%
Yes, we will.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.499 line:93%
I'm glad that
we had this meeting today.

00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:29.200 line:93%
If everything you told us is true,

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:31.910 line:93%
I don't have
any reasons to oppose...

00:15:32.469 --> 00:15:33.979 line:93%
this marriage.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.379 line:93%
Because both of us...

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.979 line:93%
lived an unfortunate life,
we just wanted...

00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:44.249 line:93%
Tae Yang to marry...

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:47.660 line:93%
a girl who grew up in a happy family
with a lot of love.

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.629 line:93%
That's why...

00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:03.170 line:93%
Thank you for the explanation.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.869 line:93%
I will look into this
when I get back.

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:08.979 line:93%
Thank you.

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:34.239 line:93%
The chairman will be
on his way soon.

00:16:34.499 --> 00:16:35.639 line:93%
Get ready.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:26.190 line:93%
Yeon Ju loves you,
but it's a secret.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.829 line:93%
It's a secret.
You should never say it.

00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:31.489 line:93%
I told you not to say it.

00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:40.670 line:93%
Why are you laughing?

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.700 line:93%
Would you tell me why?

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.370 line:93%
It's a secret, Aunt.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.779 line:93%
But what is that?

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.979 line:93%
This?

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.779 line:93%
It's a hat for babies in Africa.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.420 line:93%
Why do babies wear hats?

00:17:57.519 --> 00:17:59.319 line:93%
So they won't die from cold...

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.289 line:93%
but live a very long life.

00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:06.430 line:93%
That's why Hat Granny wears a hat.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.499 line:93%
So she can live a very long life.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.700 line:93%
What a pig.

00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:13.499 line:93%
Hat Granny?

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.309 line:93%
When children grow up,

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:27.180 line:93%
we need to let them go their ways.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.650 line:93%
The only thing...

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:32.719 line:93%
you can do is
watch her live her life.

00:18:44.769 --> 00:18:48.739 line:93%
Mark my words. Your child is going
to suffer the sin you committed!

00:18:50.069 --> 00:18:51.170 line:93%
Right.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.539 line:93%
This is what I'm destined for.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.979 line:93%
I heard destiny isn't something
you can change.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.880 line:93%
That must be right.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.620 line:93%
I'm handing down my destiny.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.860 line:93%
Mom, how did you sleep?

00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:15.299 line:93%
My only daughter went out
and didn't come in.

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:18.100 line:93%
How do you think I would have slept?

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.269 line:93%
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:24.370 line:93%
I told you that I needed fresh air
because I had a lot on my mind.

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:26.809 line:93%
Gosh.

00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:30.079 line:93%
For someone who needed fresh air
for having a lot on one's mind,

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:32.950 line:93%
you look really good.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:37.450 line:93%
You face is literally glowing.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.690 line:93%
Gosh, Mom.

00:19:40.719 --> 00:19:43.029 line:93%
By the way, what happened
to the Harvard conman?

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.900 line:93%
You should have put the twins
and their mother to prison.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.930 line:93%
If words get out,
it won't do any good.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.529 line:93%
But I hit them really hard...

00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:54.539 line:93%
and broke a few teeth.
I can't lift my arm now.

00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:55.969 line:93%
That's how it ended.

00:19:55.969 --> 00:19:57.940 line:93%
Well done.

00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:02.239 line:93%
By the way, So Won was
really cool that day.

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:04.110 line:93%
Do you remember?

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.319 line:93%
He came in out of nowhere
and saved you.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.690 line:93%
If it were not for him,
you would have been...

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.749 line:93%
hospitalized for
at least five weeks.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.789 line:93%
You shouldn't ever forget that,
all right?

00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:18.630 line:93%
Of course I know that.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.360 line:93%
If it were not for him, you'd have
gotten married to that conman.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.569 line:93%
I can't forget that.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.739 line:93%
By the way, you just came in.
Where are you going again?

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.039 line:93%
I... I need to go to the store.

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:35.979 line:93%
New clothes are arriving today,

00:20:35.979 --> 00:20:37.350 line:93%
so I'm going to be busy.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.880 line:93%
Gosh, Yeon Ju.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.620 line:93%
I got you wrapped around my finger.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.719 line:93%
Gosh. Your store?

00:20:46.719 --> 00:20:50.329 line:93%
I know already that
you're going out to see a man.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.130 line:93%
Gosh, I can't bear to see this.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.840 line:93%
I'm so thankful
that I can be with you.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.779 line:93%
I'm so happy to have you
by my side as well.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.690 line:93%
Mom, I have something to tell you.

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:21.360 line:93%
Can we meet at home?

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.930 line:93%
Ta-da.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.670 line:93%
What are you doing? You said
you only had the morning shift.

00:21:35.539 --> 00:21:37.039 line:93%
You look so pretty.

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:41.340 line:93%
It's been months since I visited
your place. I need to look pretty.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.979 line:93%
I feel as nervous as
the first day I went to...

00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:46.249 line:93%
visit your place.

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:50.390 line:93%
Don't worry. No one in my family
will be against us.

00:21:51.249 --> 00:21:53.289 line:93%
I've been thinking overnight,

00:21:53.289 --> 00:21:56.660 line:93%
and if Mom disagrees again,
I'll just go and live at your dad's.

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:59.390 line:93%
You said he's gotten better
at housekeeping.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.200 line:93%
We won't starve there, will we?

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.029 line:93%
That's the scariest thing
I've ever heard.

00:22:04.829 --> 00:22:07.340 line:93%
I'll do my best
so that it won't ever happen.

00:22:10.469 --> 00:22:14.140 line:93%
If we had a time machine, it'd be
nice to skip all the middle parts...

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.509 line:93%
and fast-forward to the part
where we live together again.

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:20.450 line:93%
I told you not to worry.

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.549 line:93%
I won't lose you ever again.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.489 line:93%
Okay.

00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:39.370 line:93%
Why did you buy so many ingredients?

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.210 line:93%
Shin Mo did well today,
so I want to give him a prize.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.210 line:93%
Is this abalone his prize?

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.009 line:93%
I'm worried about
his ocular hypertension.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.749 line:93%
I heard abalone is good for that,
so I'll make some abalone porridge.

00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:54.150 line:93%
Gosh, Young Hye.

00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:56.890 line:93%
Why do you bother
with marriage graduation?

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.920 line:93%
You've done enough
to tame your husband.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.620 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.529 line:93%
The fact that you're still
worried about his health...

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:08.460 line:93%
shows that you still love Shin Mo.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.529 line:93%
You shouldn't stress yourself
with marriage graduation.

00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:13.900 line:93%
Just live together again.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.710 line:93%
Whatever happens, money is the best.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.539 line:93%
And having a husband is
good for you too.

00:23:20.809 --> 00:23:23.309 line:93%
You won't find a better husband
than Shin Mo.

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:26.479 line:93%
You should try living with him
and see if you can say that then.

00:23:27.279 --> 00:23:30.319 line:93%
I came because So Won said
he had something to tell me.

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:34.160 line:93%
Oh my goodness.
He must be about to do it.

00:23:35.059 --> 00:23:36.829 line:93%
It's good news.
You should look forward to it.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.960 line:93%
Mom.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.059 line:93%
We have a guest.

00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:44.269 line:93%
A guest?

00:23:50.039 --> 00:23:51.640 line:93%
Hello, Mother.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.039 line:93%
Why did you two come in together?

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.650 line:93%
I told you. It's good news.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.690 line:93%
Yeon Ju, welcome to
So Won's house.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.850 line:93%
Hello.

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:13.400 line:93%
How about Mr. Jang?

00:24:13.729 --> 00:24:15.999 line:93%
Did you find out
what I asked you to do?

00:24:17.229 --> 00:24:19.469 line:93%
A house facing south
with plentiful sunlight.

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:21.600 line:93%
How large?

00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:23.940 line:93%
That's enough.

00:24:24.309 --> 00:24:28.180 line:93%
I'll make a contract tomorrow.
Get an appointment.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.620 line:93%
What? Reunion?

00:24:37.249 --> 00:24:39.920 line:93%
Oh, my. How?

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.890 line:93%
When did this happen?

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.960 line:93%
We've never really broken up
in our minds.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.460 line:93%
We tried because of my mom,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.829 line:93%
but we just realized
that it's not possible.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.539 line:93%
We don't want to waste time.

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:55.539 line:93%
Han Gyul will be going to school
next year.

00:24:55.539 --> 00:24:57.569 line:93%
We need to make a home for her.

00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:01.309 line:93%
Will you give us your blessings?

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.880 line:93%
Of course.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.690 line:93%
If you want to get married again,

00:25:09.819 --> 00:25:13.019 line:93%
I'm thankful and happy.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.660 line:93%
But Mrs. Yang is the problem.

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:18.890 line:93%
She tried so hard...

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.930 line:93%
and even made you get divorced.

00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:25.100 line:93%
She won't agree to this easily.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.640 line:93%
Right. Nothing has really changed.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.110 line:93%
How will you persuade Mrs. Yang?

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.440 line:93%
We'll need to go through with it.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.239 line:93%
We'll try to persuade her
even if it means...

00:25:35.239 --> 00:25:37.049 line:93%
we need to try 10 or 20 times.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.979 line:93%
If that doesn't work,
I'll move here.

00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:42.950 line:93%
I was too young in the past,

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.190 line:93%
and I didn't want to live
with in-laws.

00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:48.660 line:93%
But now, I'm not in the place
to make a choice.

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:53.430 line:93%
We agree to you living together.

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:57.100 line:93%
But I think you need to
think carefully...

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.100 line:93%
about leaving your mother's house.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.539 line:93%
What do you mean?
They've gone through enough already.

00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:06.640 line:93%
They love each other,
but they had to get divorced.

00:26:07.009 --> 00:26:10.309 line:93%
They both had a hard time.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.920 line:93%
Ha Yeon Ju,

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.690 line:93%
can you swear
that you'll keep your word?

00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:18.519 line:93%
If Mrs. Yang disagrees
until the end,

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:20.920 line:93%
you need to come
and live in this house.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.960 line:93%
Yes, I swear. You can trust me.

00:26:25.289 --> 00:26:26.499 line:93%
That's enough for me.

00:26:27.229 --> 00:26:29.999 line:93%
They don't need to
go through any more trouble.

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:33.670 line:93%
I'll go and persuade
that stubborn lady.

00:26:34.969 --> 00:26:36.710 line:93%
You don't need to do that.

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:42.009 line:93%
Mom.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.710 line:93%
She just came.

00:26:45.579 --> 00:26:47.620 line:93%
Take a seat.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.979 line:93%
It'll take a while.

00:26:48.979 --> 00:26:51.190 line:93%
We don't need to talk for long.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.059 line:93%
I see how you're isolating me...

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:59.460 line:93%
and planning things by yourselves.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.259 line:93%
But I think you should listen to
what I have to say.

00:27:02.299 --> 00:27:03.600 line:93%
I'm sorry, Mother.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.999 line:93%
We were going to visit you tonight
to announce the news.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.110 line:93%
News? What news?

00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:15.239 line:93%
Yeon Ju and I are going to get
married again.

00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:18.380 line:93%
We're going to try hard
and show you that we're happy.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.719 line:93%
Please give us your blessings.

00:27:19.719 --> 00:27:21.249 line:93%
Yes, Mom.

00:27:21.249 --> 00:27:23.819 line:93%
I might die without So Won
beside me.

00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:25.450 line:93%
You've done enough.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.559 line:93%
You tried to match me up
with that Harvard conman.

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:32.660 line:93%
You've done enough to oppose us.
You should stop now.

00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:36.870 line:93%
You should. Give your blessings.

00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:39.100 line:93%
Only if you change your mind,

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.269 line:93%
everyone in this room will be happy.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.640 line:93%
That's right. They want it so much.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.440 line:93%
Just let them win this time.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.950 line:93%
They've matured so much.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.450 line:93%
They'll be all right.

00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:53.380 line:93%
I told you...

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.450 line:93%
that it's time for you
to let them go.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.920 line:93%
Hat Granny,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.120 line:93%
Yeon Ju and Dad
like each other a lot.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.259 line:93%
You should give your blessings.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:07.460 line:93%
If you don't, you're a dummy.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.729 line:93%
Hey!

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.539 line:93%
Gosh, Han Gyul.

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:15.239 line:93%
If you keep...

00:28:15.239 --> 00:28:17.269 line:93%
saying mean things to me,

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:19.710 line:93%
I won't have you
as my granddaughter.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.610 line:93%
If you call me "dummy" again,

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.279 line:93%
I'm going to scold you!

00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:26.049 line:93%
Mom.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:30.049 line:93%
Shut your mouth, everyone.

00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:35.860 line:93%
Doctor Lee, come here.
Stand beside me.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.769 line:93%
I'm not going to hit you.
Don't be scared.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.779 line:93%
You saved Yeon Ju from marrying
that Harvard conman.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:55.680 line:93%
I'll allow...

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:57.710 line:93%
you to marry again.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.350 line:93%
You make me sick, but do your best
to live happily.

00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:04.190 line:93%
Mother.

00:29:04.749 --> 00:29:06.190 line:93%
I'm so happy.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.090 line:93%
You thought well.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.789 line:93%
You made a really hard decision.

00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:13.630 line:93%
You're very broad-minded.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.569 line:93%
Thank you.

00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:19.170 line:93%
They will live really happily.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.299 line:93%
My goodness.

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:24.539 line:93%
Very good job.

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:27.110 line:93%
There's no time to delay.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.180 line:93%
Let's have a simple meal
with the family next week.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.680 line:93%
We'll pack their things
and send them to you immediately.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.380 line:93%
No.

00:29:35.779 --> 00:29:40.890 line:93%
Send all of their things to...

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:45.229 line:93%
the apartment located
at Cheongdam intersection.

00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:48.660 line:93%
Mother.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.729 line:93%
We're going to live with you.
What are you talking about?

00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:53.039 line:93%
No thank you.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.710 line:93%
I don't want to see...

00:29:58.239 --> 00:30:02.410 line:93%
Yeon Ju having a hard time
raising this child.

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:05.079 line:93%
The apartment is about 200mÂ².

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:08.019 line:93%
It will be just right
and cozy for three people.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.319 line:93%
From this moment, we're done...

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.120 line:93%
talking about their remarriage.

00:30:15.719 --> 00:30:16.789 line:93%
The end.

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:18.960 line:93%
Wait a minute.

00:30:19.229 --> 00:30:21.829 line:93%
Are you going to accept them or not?

00:30:25.529 --> 00:30:26.940 line:93%
Goodness.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.039 line:93%
Wait a minute.

00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:32.210 line:93%
Gosh.

00:30:32.739 --> 00:30:34.340 line:93%
What is she doing?

00:30:34.979 --> 00:30:37.450 line:93%
Oh, my.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.279 line:93%
How could you just leave like that?

00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:45.120 line:93%
The kids are so in love.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.860 line:93%
How could you throw
a cold blanket like that?

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.819 line:93%
I told you continuously.

00:30:48.819 --> 00:30:50.430 line:93%
Do you still not understand?

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:52.630 line:93%
Let go of the kids now.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.029 line:93%
Let go of me.

00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:58.729 line:93%
This is the best I can do.

00:30:59.229 --> 00:31:00.340 line:93%
Mrs. Yang.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.210 line:93%
The kids said
that they will live happily.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.670 line:93%
Just trust them one more time.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.009 line:93%
Stop it. You don't have to do that.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.049 line:93%
She can do as she likes.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.850 line:93%
You can't be like this.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.420 line:93%
You've caused enough trouble.
You need to stop now.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.289 line:93%
Is it that big of a deal
to have a daughter?

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.590 line:93%
I heard...

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:24.559 line:93%
that my son stopped your daughter
from marrying a conman.

00:31:24.559 --> 00:31:26.700 line:93%
You should be grateful.

00:31:26.999 --> 00:31:29.160 line:93%
What? Grateful?

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.469 line:93%
Let's be honest.

00:31:31.769 --> 00:31:35.870 line:93%
We don't have that much time
left in life.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:40.210 line:93%
You'll probably pass away
10 years earlier than me.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.579 line:93%
You need to learn how to bend
yourself...

00:31:43.579 --> 00:31:45.680 line:93%
for the future of the kids.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.719 line:93%
You've been showing off
what you have done for them.

00:31:47.719 --> 00:31:49.219 line:93%
Now you're saying, "Just take this
and leave."

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.059 line:93%
You're just throwing
a temper tantrum.

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:55.319 line:93%
It's just an old person being
crabby.

00:31:56.019 --> 00:32:00.360 line:93%
Do you think I'm doing this because
I'm crabby?

00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:03.600 line:93%
If you don't know anything
about a person's story,

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.469 line:93%
just be quiet and stay still.

00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:07.640 line:93%
Okay.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.370 line:93%
I was going to stop talking.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.880 line:93%
Yeon Ju, do as I told you.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.110 line:93%
It doesn't matter if there's
an apartment in Cheongdam.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.380 line:93%
Pack your things,
and move to this house.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.719 line:93%
- Father.
- Fine.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.420 line:93%
Do as you want. I don't care
if you live here or there.

00:32:25.489 --> 00:32:27.219 line:93%
Goodbye.

00:32:27.219 --> 00:32:28.289 line:93%
Mother.

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:29.660 line:93%
- Mom.
- Gosh.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.559 line:93%
Oh, my.

00:32:37.569 --> 00:32:38.769 line:93%
Gosh.

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:50.610 line:93%
Mother.

00:33:03.829 --> 00:33:06.430 line:93%
You did a good job.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.029 line:93%
I don't care if they hate me.
This was my best option.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.509 line:93%
Regarding the misunderstanding
on Ru Ri,

00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:23.779 line:93%
please check directly with
Ru Ri and Tae Yang.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.249 line:93%
Tell Tae Yang and Ae Ri
to come to my office.

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:28.579 line:93%
Okay.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.930 line:93%
Manager Jung, the chairman
wants to see you at 3pm.

00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:38.989 line:93%
Okay.

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:41.400 line:93%
I was going to see him.

00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:46.239 line:93%
Will the chairman listen to you now?

00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:50.640 line:93%
I'll have to meet him first and do
my best to reveal the truth.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.340 line:93%
Did you prepare everything
I asked you to do?

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.779 line:93%
Yes.

00:33:57.049 --> 00:34:00.650 line:93%
This is the statement of what Ae Ri
did at the printing office.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.049 line:93%
I wrote in detail about what
happened in Guam.

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:08.489 line:93%
I also called Stephanie
who worked together with us.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.390 line:93%
She also sent a statement.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.030 line:93%
I have the video of Ae Ri...

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.639 line:93%
copying the menu that you have
developed in this USB.

00:34:24.269 --> 00:34:25.369 line:93%
Thank you.

00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:27.479 line:93%
Father will believe us
if he sees these.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.940 line:93%
Cheer up.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.880 line:93%
Call me whenever you need
my testimony.

00:34:39.519 --> 00:34:41.690 line:93%
The chairman will arrive
in five minutes.

00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:22.970 line:93%
Manager Jung, isn't that Ru Ri?

00:35:27.499 --> 00:35:28.699 line:93%
That's Ru Ri, isn't it?

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:30.639 line:93%
Why is she here?

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.050 line:93%
Meet me in the conference room
at 3pm.

00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:54.429 line:93%
It's me.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:55.630 line:93%
Where are you right now?

00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:57.999 line:93%
- Are you here?
- Yes.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.139 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri wanted to see me.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:14.949 line:93%
Why don't you get in?

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:22.760 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:25.030 line:93%
Ru Ri, what's going on?

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.030 line:93%
It's Joo Ae Ri. Wait a minute.

00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:28.800 line:93%
Stop.

00:36:29.159 --> 00:36:30.599 line:93%
- Joo Ae Ri!
- Manager Jung!

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.139 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.499 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri.

00:36:38.409 --> 00:36:39.539 line:93%
Let's go.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.740 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri, wait a minute.

00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:47.949 line:93%
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

00:36:52.389 --> 00:36:53.559 line:93%
Give me my bag.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.360 line:93%
No, please don't push me.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.829 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:37:04.729 --> 00:37:06.670 line:93%
- I'm just...
- No.

00:37:06.869 --> 00:37:08.599 line:93%
Please don't touch me.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.309 line:93%
What?

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.880 line:93%
Ae Ri.

00:37:55.019 --> 00:37:57.420 line:93%
Ae Ri, are you okay?

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.789 line:93%
I think she's heavily injured.

00:37:58.889 --> 00:37:59.990 line:93%
We need to move her to the hospital.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.119 line:93%
Hello, is this 911?

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.530 line:93%
This is SC Food and Beverage.
Please come quickly.

00:38:25.909 --> 00:38:27.780 line:93%
We're doing this to help Dad, right?

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.150 line:93%
Of course.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:31.619 line:93%
We're going to be a matchmaker
from now on.

00:38:31.789 --> 00:38:33.860 line:93%
We're going to be a couple manager
that connects Mom and Dad.

00:38:34.159 --> 00:38:36.990 line:93%
I'm not sure how effective
it will be, but let's do our best.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.829 line:93%
Who told you to do the dishes?

00:38:41.729 --> 00:38:44.699 line:93%
Stop taking my work away from me,
and mind your own business.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.030 line:93%
It's okay.

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:48.039 line:93%
Mom's not attracted to you
since you always do the chores.

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:50.010 line:93%
That's why she doesn't sleep
with you in the same room.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.380 line:93%
Be romantic from now on
like when you were dating.

00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:57.550 line:93%
Right.
Work out and get some muscles.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.479 line:93%
Lie down on the couch.
I'll put a facial mask on you.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.190 line:93%
No thank you. I'm too old for it.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.789 line:93%
Don't say that. You're still good.

00:39:05.789 --> 00:39:07.960 line:93%
Cheer up. And make us
a younger sibling.

00:39:08.019 --> 00:39:09.119 line:93%
What?

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.929 line:93%
Younger... Stop it.

00:39:12.389 --> 00:39:13.559 line:93%
Gosh.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.729 line:93%
I'm home.

00:39:16.369 --> 00:39:17.729 line:93%
I'm going to rest.

00:39:17.929 --> 00:39:18.999 line:93%
Okay.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.900 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.309 line:93%
Go and give her some foot massage.

00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:26.510 line:93%
She said she's going to rest.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.539 line:93%
Hurry up.

00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:29.710 line:93%
Eun Byul and I will stay upstairs.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:30.780 line:93%
Let's go.

00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:32.479 line:93%
Guys...

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.130 line:93%
I...

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.300 line:93%
trust my son more than Joo Ae Ri.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.470 line:93%
How did it go?

00:39:55.369 --> 00:39:56.740 line:93%
Did you sort things out?

00:40:00.479 --> 00:40:02.679 line:93%
What? Did it not work out?

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:05.849 line:93%
Was Joo Ae Ri right?

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.019 line:93%
I must be stupid.

00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:11.820 line:93%
I trust people so easily.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.820 line:93%
I don't have an eye for people.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.929 line:93%
That's why my life is so miserable.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.789 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.229 line:93%
I almost hurt Tae Yang's heart
if it wasn't for you.

00:40:24.099 --> 00:40:26.570 line:93%
I think there's something
going on around Tae Yang.

00:40:27.499 --> 00:40:30.110 line:93%
Thanks to you,
Chairman Kevin's on action.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.039 line:93%
The truth will be revealed soon.

00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:34.510 line:93%
That's a relief.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.349 line:93%
But it's true that you're stupid.

00:40:39.409 --> 00:40:42.749 line:93%
You chose me instead of
wealthy Chairman Kevin.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.920 line:93%
You must've been very upset
because of me.

00:40:50.729 --> 00:40:54.300 line:93%
I realized once again how much
you mean to me.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.070 line:93%
I'll try harder.

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:16.920 line:93%
I can't believe it.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.320 line:93%
How could something
so scandalous happen in the company?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.889 line:93%
What's going on?

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.030 line:93%
Father. I don't know what you saw,

00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:26.159 line:93%
but you should never trust it
as it is.

00:41:26.499 --> 00:41:28.260 line:93%
It's all part of Ae Ri's plan.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.570 line:93%
You stay quiet.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.940 line:93%
Lee Ru Ri.

00:41:33.869 --> 00:41:35.400 line:93%
Explain what's going on.

00:41:35.869 --> 00:41:37.539 line:93%
Why did this happen?

00:41:38.269 --> 00:41:42.710 line:93%
You wouldn't trust anything I say,

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.519 line:93%
but it's so unfair to back off
like this,

00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:51.220 line:93%
so I'll only tell you the truth.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.159 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri called me around noon
and said that...

00:41:56.789 --> 00:41:58.590 line:93%
she needed to discuss something
with me...

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.800 line:93%
and wanted to meet
in the conference room at 3pm.

00:42:01.699 --> 00:42:03.729 line:93%
I even have call history.

00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:05.429 line:93%
So?

00:42:05.929 --> 00:42:09.240 line:93%
I was on the elevator, then suddenly
it stopped on the second floor.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:13.539 line:93%
Joo Ae Ri was waiting outside.
She suddenly took my bag...

00:42:13.809 --> 00:42:15.610 line:93%
and ran towards the stairs.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.010 line:93%
I chased her since I didn't know
what was going on.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.519 line:93%
She's right. I heard everything
because we were on the phone.

00:42:23.019 --> 00:42:25.920 line:93%
I heard Ru Ri saying "what are you
doing?" and chasing her.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.559 line:93%
I told you to stay quiet.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.530 line:93%
So? Did you get emotional
and ended up pushing her?

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.159 line:93%
That's not true, sir.

00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:39.269 line:93%
I only wanted to get my bag.

00:42:39.269 --> 00:42:42.400 line:93%
She screamed and jumped off
the stairs.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.210 line:93%
That doesn't make sense at all.
That's so dangerous.

00:42:45.909 --> 00:42:48.610 line:93%
Who would do that
unless they're out of their mind?

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.110 line:93%
What would she get out of it?

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.050 line:93%
Me right now.

00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:54.280 line:93%
I already lost your trust.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.650 line:93%
Now she's turned me into a psycho.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.559 line:93%
She's right, Father.
You must trust us.

00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:06.999 line:93%
I have witnesses outside, sir.

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:10.800 line:93%
I think they'll help you judge.

00:43:12.229 --> 00:43:13.300 line:93%
Let them in.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.440 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.420 line:93%
Tell him...

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.220 line:93%
exactly as you saw.

00:43:32.849 --> 00:43:36.260 line:93%
Did you see the woman standing
next to you pushing the other woman?

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.130 line:93%
Yes. I was getting on the elevator
on the second floor,

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.059 line:93%
then I heard them fighting.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.070 line:93%
The other woman was running away.

00:43:44.429 --> 00:43:47.639 line:93%
This woman chased her
and argued with her.

00:43:48.199 --> 00:43:50.210 line:93%
Don't touch me. Please.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.340 line:93%
That woman begged her not to touch
her, but she still pushed her.

00:43:54.479 --> 00:43:55.740 line:93%
Then she fell off.

00:43:55.979 --> 00:43:57.110 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:59.249 line:93%
I saw it too.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:00.720 line:93%
I saw her...

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.690 line:93%
getting pushed in the lobby
and falling down.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.289 line:93%
Wait.

00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:09.519 line:93%
Did you see her pushing her?

00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:13.300 line:93%
Tell me the truth.

00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:16.970 line:93%
Did you see her pushing her
with your own eyes?

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.400 line:93%
I don't know. It happened so fast.

00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:24.539 line:93%
Anyway, I heard her saying,
"Please don't push me."

00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:25.740 line:93%
What about you?

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.039 line:93%
Tell me what you saw only.

00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:35.880 line:93%
Stop it. It's so pathetic that
I can't listen to it anymore.

00:44:36.619 --> 00:44:38.990 line:93%
Good job. You can leave now.

00:44:46.159 --> 00:44:48.929 line:93%
Father. You have to see the truth.

00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:51.030 line:93%
The truth that Ru Ri would never do
such thing.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.400 line:93%
It's all Joo Ae Ri's plan.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.570 line:93%
I'm telling you the truth.
Please trust me, sir.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.010 line:93%
I met your father today and
listened to what he had to say.

00:45:02.579 --> 00:45:05.380 line:93%
Until then I thought that
I misunderstood...

00:45:05.749 --> 00:45:08.479 line:93%
and that I should let Tae Yang
marry the person he wants.

00:45:08.479 --> 00:45:10.190 line:93%
How could this happen?

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.550 line:93%
- Chairman Kevin.
- I want to trust you too.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.360 line:93%
But it happened in front of me,

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.190 line:93%
and we have witnesses.
How do you expect me to trust you?

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.599 line:93%
I have to see evidence to trust you.

00:45:24.269 --> 00:45:26.699 line:93%
I believe people don't change
easily.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.409 line:93%
When you see this, you'll realize
what Joo Ae Ri has done.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:36.280 line:93%
If you still can't believe it after
you see it,

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:38.610 line:93%
I won't say anything.

00:45:40.019 --> 00:45:41.019 line:93%
Follow me.

00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:43.349 line:93%
- Wait. Chairman Kevin.
- Stop it.

00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:44.389 line:93%
Let's go.

00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:06.610 line:93%
Manager Jung.
We can't leave like this.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.340 line:93%
We must straighten things up.

00:46:09.139 --> 00:46:10.479 line:93%
You can stay here.

00:46:10.479 --> 00:46:12.679 line:93%
I'll go talk to the chairman again.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.050 line:93%
Don't you get it?

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.289 line:93%
Whatever we say, he won't trust us.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.760 line:93%
He already has prejudice,

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.490 line:93%
and that happened in front of him.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.460 line:93%
Do you think he'd trust us?

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.460 line:93%
What do you want to do now?

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.599 line:93%
Do you want to let him misunderstand
and think I'm a psycho?

00:46:30.729 --> 00:46:33.570 line:93%
You want to give in to him
and break up?

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.639 line:93%
Is that why you dragged me out?

00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:37.240 line:93%
Don't you get it?

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.710 line:93%
If Father doesn't stop,

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.510 line:93%
there's only one way to stop him...

00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:45.610 line:93%
from being fooled by that witch.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.119 line:93%
What would that be?

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.420 line:93%
No matter what happens,
I'm not breaking up with you.

00:46:53.559 --> 00:46:55.789 line:93%
But I lived 30 years without Father.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.159 line:93%
I'm willing to live without him
again.

00:47:00.199 --> 00:47:01.329 line:93%
Manager Jung.

00:47:01.329 --> 00:47:03.329 line:93%
I gave him the last chance.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:06.769 line:93%
It's up to him to grab it or not.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:18.949 line:93%
You make the hat...

00:47:18.949 --> 00:47:21.650 line:93%
to live a very long life.

00:47:45.869 --> 00:47:46.880 line:93%
Hey.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.610 line:93%
Are you showing off
that you're highly educated?

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.019 line:93%
Why would you play
some ghost music like that...

00:47:55.019 --> 00:47:57.749 line:93%
in the house when I'm so disturbed?

00:47:57.749 --> 00:47:58.820 line:93%
Oh, my.

00:47:59.249 --> 00:48:03.590 line:93%
This is a very famous aria.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.389 line:93%
Puccini's Gianni Schicchi's...

00:48:05.389 --> 00:48:07.800 line:93%
Whether it's Gianni or not,

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:11.570 line:93%
I'm heartbroken, and it's painful.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.740 line:93%
Give me some makgeolli to drink.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.099 line:93%
Make some jeon too.

00:48:15.099 --> 00:48:18.869 line:93%
You have so many wines
in the winery.

00:48:18.869 --> 00:48:21.380 line:93%
Why would you drink makgeolli?
It's not dignifying.

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.150 line:93%
If you burp after drinking it,
it stinks.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.619 line:93%
If I want to poop and rub it over,

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.720 line:93%
it doesn't matter
because it's my house.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.590 line:93%
Take out makgeolli
and make some jeon.

00:48:35.159 --> 00:48:36.229 line:93%
Yes.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.599 line:93%
Think about their future...

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:49.499 line:93%
and you need to learn
how to bend yourself.

00:48:49.499 --> 00:48:51.369 line:93%
You've been showing off
what you have done for them.

00:48:51.369 --> 00:48:52.909 line:93%
And now you want to ruin everything?

00:48:53.079 --> 00:48:57.210 line:93%
You're just throwing
a temper tantrum.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.249 line:93%
It's just an old person being
crabby.

00:48:59.979 --> 00:49:02.320 line:93%
Crabby?

00:49:03.949 --> 00:49:08.220 line:93%
What does he know about
the difficult life I have led?

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.659 line:93%
How dare he say that?

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.729 line:93%
That's strange.

00:49:16.429 --> 00:49:18.400 line:93%
It's shocking.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.940 line:93%
She let everything go
after seeing them happy...

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.440 line:93%
at the pension.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.440 line:93%
She even cried.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.679 line:93%
But why would she cause trouble
like this?

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.809 line:93%
I know, right?

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:32.710 line:93%
She's just making up
weird conditions...

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.949 line:93%
because she has no other reason.

00:49:35.479 --> 00:49:38.949 line:93%
It's not that they're unwilling to
move out of her house.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.690 line:93%
Living at her house
is already stressful.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.760 line:93%
So Won, it's good for you.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.099 line:93%
- Father.
- Am I wrong?

00:49:47.999 --> 00:49:51.300 line:93%
To be honest, if she's that rich,

00:49:51.429 --> 00:49:53.139 line:93%
she needs to be thankful.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.539 line:93%
If I were her,

00:49:55.539 --> 00:49:58.210 line:93%
I'd build 10 orphanages.

00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:01.909 line:93%
If I have more left, I'd donate one
billion dollars to Seoul Station.

00:50:02.179 --> 00:50:05.210 line:93%
They can help the homeless survive
through this cold weather.

00:50:05.909 --> 00:50:08.650 line:93%
She won't take it with her
when she dies.

00:50:09.249 --> 00:50:12.650 line:93%
Raising a child won't be much.
Why is she making a fuss?

00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:14.990 line:93%
Oh my goodness.

00:50:15.519 --> 00:50:18.530 line:93%
If anyone hears you, Shin Mo,
they'd think you're brazen.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:23.030 line:93%
It was our mistake
having a child out of wedlock.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.999 line:93%
Why do you blame her?

00:50:25.999 --> 00:50:30.139 line:93%
I mean, they are in love.

00:50:30.139 --> 00:50:33.510 line:93%
With this much romance,
everything can be excused.

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:37.249 line:93%
"If you can make a woman laugh,"

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:40.220 line:93%
"you can make her do anything."

00:50:41.119 --> 00:50:45.119 line:93%
So Won. If you can make her laugh,

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:47.159 line:93%
you can make her do anything.

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.059 line:93%
There must be a reason behind this.

00:50:51.159 --> 00:50:53.130 line:93%
You should try...

00:50:53.559 --> 00:50:55.199 line:93%
and solve her problem.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.999 line:93%
Gosh. Don't try to teach here.

00:50:59.999 --> 00:51:01.670 line:93%
You're such a teacher.

00:51:02.269 --> 00:51:04.510 line:93%
In this house, I'm the truth.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.240 line:93%
Just do as I say.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:09.010 line:93%
Shin Mo, be quiet.

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:11.349 line:93%
Yeon Ju,

00:51:11.979 --> 00:51:13.979 line:93%
what do you want to do?

00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:17.019 line:93%
Shin Mo is right.

00:51:17.289 --> 00:51:19.190 line:93%
I don't want to fight with Mom.

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:22.119 line:93%
I want to live with So Won
as soon as possible.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.490 line:93%
So I'll move here.

00:51:24.729 --> 00:51:28.429 line:93%
I don't think I can raise
Han Gyul by myself.

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.369 line:93%
She always gets me.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.340 line:93%
They say that we should
strike while the iron is hot.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:39.409 line:93%
Now that we're talking about this,
you should pack and come home.

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:44.010 line:93%
Mrs. Yang agreed.
You should come tomorrow.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.179 line:93%
So Won's room has been
painted clean,

00:51:48.179 --> 00:51:50.519 line:93%
so you don't need to worry
about anything. Come live here.

00:51:50.519 --> 00:51:51.849 line:93%
All right, Father.

00:51:51.849 --> 00:51:54.519 line:93%
I'll trust you and pack my things.

00:51:56.119 --> 00:51:58.329 line:93%
How about you, So Won?
Do you agree?

00:51:59.699 --> 00:52:00.860 line:93%
I'll deal with this.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.199 line:93%
Let's go. I'll take you home.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.050 line:93%
Do you think I'm being crabby?

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.920 line:93%
If you don't know anything,

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.090 line:93%
shut your mouth.

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:29.519 line:93%
After I let him go,

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.289 line:93%
my life has been a fiery pit.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.369 line:93%
And now you want Yeon Ju
to go through the same hardship?

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:39.840 line:93%
I beg you.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.369 line:93%
Just let go of Yeon Ju now.

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:51.749 line:93%
What are you thinking about?

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:54.949 line:93%
Are you worried
because I'm leaving Mom?

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.420 line:93%
You're not leaving.

00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:57.889 line:93%
We're going to live with her.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:02.559 line:93%
You're not saying I should
wait a little longer, are you?

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:04.059 line:93%
I think I know the reason why.

00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:05.789 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:53:05.889 --> 00:53:07.360 line:93%
Your mom doesn't hold grudges.

00:53:08.159 --> 00:53:11.970 line:93%
If she had to give us conditions,
there must be a reason.

00:53:12.199 --> 00:53:14.900 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:53:18.869 --> 00:53:21.840 line:93%
Have you heard of the name
Ha Eun Jo?

00:53:22.909 --> 00:53:24.210 line:93%
Ha Eun Jo?

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.949 line:93%
Who is that?

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.720 line:93%
Your older brother.

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:31.920 line:93%
What?

00:53:33.559 --> 00:53:35.260 line:93%
I had a brother?

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.030 line:93%
That can't be.

00:53:40.699 --> 00:53:42.300 line:93%
Where is he?

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:44.599 line:93%
In your mom's heart.

00:53:45.869 --> 00:53:46.970 line:93%
What?

00:53:48.369 --> 00:53:53.380 line:93%
Mungyeong Saejae

00:53:53.979 --> 00:53:58.749 line:93%
Why is there a hill?

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:05.220 line:93%
The bending path

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:10.490 line:93%
Raises me up

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.369 line:93%
Gosh.

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.780 line:93%
- Hey!
- Catch me!

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.179 line:93%
Come here!

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:33.679 line:93%
Be careful!

00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:38.420 line:93%
Live life

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.920 line:93%
Roundly like a pumpkin

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:46.190 line:93%
Mungyeong Saejae

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.860 line:93%
Why is there a hill?

00:54:49.729 --> 00:54:53.340 line:93%
The bending path

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.769 line:93%
Makes me cry

00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.940 line:93%
Ari arirang

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:03.179 line:93%
Suri surirang

00:55:03.979 --> 00:55:09.079 line:93%
Ara-riga natne

00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:12.349 line:93%
- Arirang
- Mom, I'm home!

00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:13.559 line:93%
I'm here too!

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:15.820 line:93%
Coming.

00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:23.030 line:93%
Don't they love it?

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:26.900 line:93%
Your father-in-law
always said he wanted to...

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.539 line:93%
live with you.

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:31.639 line:93%
Gosh, it's good news for him.

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.479 line:93%
Mom, please don't be angry.

00:55:34.479 --> 00:55:38.010 line:93%
No, I'm not angry. I'm not.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.519 line:93%
I mean,

00:55:40.619 --> 00:55:43.650 line:93%
my daughter is going to
live with someone she loves.

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:45.949 line:93%
Why would I be angry?

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.920 line:93%
I mean it. I do.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.630 line:93%
My biggest wish was that
you'd find someone you love...

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:54.130 line:93%
and that you'd live with him.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:56.130 line:93%
I mean it, Yeon Ju.

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.670 line:93%
So you can take all your clothes...

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.999 line:93%
and the furniture you want
from this house.

00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:05.670 line:93%
And if you need anything else,
you can buy anything.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.139 line:93%
You can buy everything you want.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.449 line:93%
I just had a few drinks,

00:56:10.449 --> 00:56:13.119 line:93%
and now I'm feeling dizzy.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.050 line:93%
You should stay a bit before you go.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.690 line:93%
You're doing this because of him.

00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:24.929 line:93%
Ha Eun Jo.

00:56:25.729 --> 00:56:26.999 line:93%
Yeon Ju's brother.

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:34.340 line:93%
Why do you have such a light mouth?

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:38.139 line:93%
Stop talking nonsense and leave.
I don't want to talk about it.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.150 line:93%
Mother, please.

00:56:54.159 --> 00:56:55.820 line:93%
I need to talk to you.

00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:58.190 line:93%
Why don't you listen to me?

00:56:58.829 --> 00:57:03.130 line:93%
I don't want to talk about it.
Why do you come lurking here?

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.530 line:93%
I am right, aren't I?

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:07.699 line:93%
You want us to live separately
because of Eun Jo, right?

00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:10.269 line:93%
You don't want to watch Yeon Ju
raise Han Gyul.

00:57:10.369 --> 00:57:14.880 line:93%
If you know that,
why do you keep talking about that?

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.610 line:93%
You're right. I'm a sinner.

00:57:17.849 --> 00:57:19.820 line:93%
I have sinned.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:24.320 line:93%
So I can't bear to watch Yeon Ju
raise someone else's child.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.720 line:93%
That's why I told you to leave.

00:57:27.289 --> 00:57:31.159 line:93%
It's like torture to me.

00:57:31.159 --> 00:57:32.329 line:93%
Stop it.

00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:34.699 line:93%
You don't need to feel guilty.

00:57:35.499 --> 00:57:37.070 line:93%
You told me...

00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:39.670 line:93%
that you sent your brother away
because of your mother-in-law...

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.570 line:93%
and it happened
while you went to see him.

00:57:42.909 --> 00:57:44.809 line:93%
Anyone would have done it
in a situation like that.

00:57:45.369 --> 00:57:47.740 line:93%
He disappeared while you were
secretly out.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.309 line:93%
That's not your fault.

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:52.010 line:93%
That's no one's fault.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.380 line:93%
You didn't abandon him on purpose.

00:57:54.749 --> 00:57:56.389 line:93%
You don't need to feel guilty.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.559 line:93%
So, please forget the past...

00:58:01.389 --> 00:58:03.059 line:93%
What if I did abandon him?

00:58:07.159 --> 00:58:09.429 line:93%
What if I did abandon him?

00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:19.780 line:93%
I couldn't... I couldn't tell you.

00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:25.179 line:93%
That's not something
that a human would do.

00:58:25.179 --> 00:58:27.380 line:93%
But it's what I've done.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:30.289 line:93%
So I couldn't tell you the truth!

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.619 line:93%
Mother.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.490 line:93%
Gosh.

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:44.329 line:93%
I...

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.900 line:93%
Eun Jo...

00:58:48.099 --> 00:58:50.909 line:93%
I abandoned Eun Jo...

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:55.340 line:93%
on purpose.

00:58:56.449 --> 00:58:59.010 line:93%
I went back home to see my brother.

00:58:59.749 --> 00:59:01.880 line:93%
I couldn't stand watching...

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.820 line:93%
how he was living,

00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:08.119 line:93%
so I abandoned him.

00:59:15.559 --> 00:59:16.729 line:93%
Chun Bum.

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:18.300 line:93%
Chun Ok.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.110 line:93%
My mother-in-law promised me...

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:25.340 line:93%
to send him to a rich family.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.940 line:93%
But he cut wood in the winter...

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.309 line:93%
wearing worn-out cotton clothes...

00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:33.050 line:93%
and rubber shoes.

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.380 line:93%
They didn't even send him to school.

00:59:35.449 --> 00:59:38.849 line:93%
They made him work
like a total slave.

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:40.820 line:93%
After I saw that,

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:48.130 line:93%
I did what I did.

00:59:50.199 --> 00:59:51.499 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:54.240 line:93%
What did you do?

00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:58.610 line:93%
Tell me what you did.

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.079 line:93%
What did you do?

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.590 line:93%
Hey, kid.

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:18.929 line:93%
Wake up, kid.

01:00:26.369 --> 01:00:27.900 line:93%
Chun Ok.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.369 line:93%
Chun Ok.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.409 line:93%
Chun Ok.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.240 line:93%
Chun Ok.

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.809 line:93%
What do I do now?

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.479 line:93%
Chun Ok.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.849 line:93%
What do I do now?

01:00:48.389 --> 01:00:50.260 line:93%
I left Eun Jo there...

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.800 line:93%
and went home alone.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.729 line:93%
I left him in the train station
and went home alone.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.970 line:93%
I left him crying on the street...

01:01:02.139 --> 01:01:04.409 line:93%
and went home alone.

01:01:05.539 --> 01:01:06.679 line:93%
Mom.

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:10.610 line:93%
Since then...

01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:14.420 line:93%
we could never find him.

01:01:15.619 --> 01:01:17.349 line:93%
When I got pregnant with you,

01:01:17.949 --> 01:01:20.690 line:93%
my mother-in-law cursed at me.

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:23.829 line:93%
If I ever give a birth
to a daughter,

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:28.030 line:93%
my daughter will pay for what I did.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.099 line:93%
She cursed at me.

01:01:32.499 --> 01:01:34.999 line:93%
If you raise Dr. Lee's child,

01:01:34.999 --> 01:01:38.340 line:93%
that's all my fault.

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:40.280 line:93%
You're raising Han Gyul...

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.280 line:93%
because of what I've done wrong.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.220 line:93%
That's why I can't face her.

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.789 line:93%
I can't. Do you get it?

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:01.499 line:93%
Mom.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.070 line:93%
You were suffering so much.
Why didn't you tell me?

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:06.599 line:93%
You should've told me earlier.

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:09.139 line:93%
Then you didn't have
to suffer alone...

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:12.139 line:93%
for all those years.

01:02:15.579 --> 01:02:18.110 line:93%
But Mom...

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:20.449 line:93%
if that's so painful,

01:02:21.079 --> 01:02:24.749 line:93%
you can pay Han Gyul for
what you did to him instead.

01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:28.460 line:93%
Give the love you couldn't
give him to Han Gyul,

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.829 line:93%
and you can pay her instead.

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:33.329 line:93%
As long as you and I raise
Han Gyul together,

01:02:33.699 --> 01:02:34.860 line:93%
it's all fine.

01:02:35.929 --> 01:02:38.630 line:93%
As much as we love Han Gyul,

01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:44.139 line:93%
someone else probably loved
my brother.

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:48.179 line:93%
That will do it. That'll do it, Mom.

01:02:49.139 --> 01:02:50.449 line:93%
Let's do that.

01:02:51.949 --> 01:02:53.280 line:93%
That will do, Mom.

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:54.840 line:93%
What? Chun Ok?

01:03:55.579 --> 01:03:57.050 line:93%
Say it.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.110 line:93%
What are you supposed to call her
instead of Chun Ok?

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:02.479 line:93%
Chun Ok. Chun Ok. Chun Ok.

01:04:02.479 --> 01:04:05.389 line:93%
Mom. It's Mom. Call her Mom.

01:04:05.389 --> 01:04:07.019 line:93%
Chun Ok.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.220 line:93%
Do it again.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:16.869 line:93%
Goodness.

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:23.210 line:93%
It's fine.

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.539 line:93%
It's fine.

01:05:12.019 --> 01:05:13.389 line:93%
Kim Eun Jo

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.690 line:93%
Eun Jo.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.829 line:93%
Is that my real name?

01:05:36.979 --> 01:05:38.150 line:93%
Manager Jung.

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:40.849 line:93%
(Myung Rang forgot the order.)

01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:44.990 line:93%
Sorry.

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:46.789 line:93%
(I'm sorry.)

01:05:46.889 --> 01:05:48.789 line:93%
(It's Tae Yang's turn
to say the line.)

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:49.860 line:93%
(Laughing)

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.030 line:93%
I'm sorry.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.130 line:93%
Gosh.

01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:54.900 line:93%
(Man Who Sets the Table)

01:05:55.059 --> 01:05:57.030 line:93%
Mom. Should I give up
on this marriage?

01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:00.099 line:93%
I can't think of a way to beat her.

01:06:00.099 --> 01:06:01.999 line:93%
Have you forgotten
how Ae Ri's mom died?

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.440 line:93%
We're not bad.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.110 line:93%
We're getting back what's ours.

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.740 line:93%
This is justice.

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.210 line:93%
You must be happy this time.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:13.550 line:93%
I'll make you smile
for the rest of your life.

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:15.880 line:93%
I'm going to make you pay for it
today.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.490 line:93%
Exactly as I suffered.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:20.990 line:93%
As far as I know, you can never
beat me no matter what you do.
