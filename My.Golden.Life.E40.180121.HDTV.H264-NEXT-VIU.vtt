3
00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:10.712
(Episode 40)

4
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.436
Do you see that mountain?

5
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.337
I found her near the top of that mountain.

6
00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:23.906
She collapsed after taking medicine.

7
00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:28.476
She seemed she'd do it again.

8
00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:30.217
That's why I kept her and made her work...

9
00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:31.476
so she wouldn't think about anything else.

10
00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:34.616
When it's combined,

11
00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:35.616
push it to anywhere you want...

12
00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:36.756
since it has wheels.

13
00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:38.016
Also, we should use a whiteboard...

14
00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:39.126
for the tabletop.

15
00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:42.186
A bed and a table. It's like a transformer.

16
00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:43.827
But it exists already.

17
00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:44.957
I saw one in hardwood.

18
00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:46.266
I know that too,

19
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.766
but it can also be a bookshelf and a table.

20
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.537
The whiteboard is what makes it special.

21
00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:51.796
If students use this in their studio...

22
00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:53.567
or in their rooftop house, they'll get more space.

23
00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.567
But how did you come up with this idea?

24
00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:58.677
I went to see Dad.

25
00:00:59.147 --> 00:01:00.747
His room was so empty.

26
00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:03.376
I was making a shelf with leftover wood.

27
00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.217
I thought about making a shelf that can...

28
00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:08.286
also be a table. Then I came up with this idea.

29
00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:11.057
Don't you think you're working too hard?

30
00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:12.486
The academy and here.

31
00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:14.727
You worked at night, and even on your days off now.

32
00:01:15.227 --> 00:01:16.596
Are you going to stay here all day?

33
00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:19.497
I don't know. I must be an ultra-super woman.

34
00:01:19.697 --> 00:01:21.426
Ever since I realized my dad's safe,

35
00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:23.296
I don't get tired at all. I'm excited.

36
00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:27.766
This is only a rough sketch.

37
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.176
Come up with more details.

38
00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:31.077
I'll look for the wood we should use for this.

39
00:01:54.096 --> 00:01:55.837
What is it? Did you forget something?

40
00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:01.837
It's our day off today.

41
00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:05.307
Did you forget something too?

42
00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:20.857
Is everything okay?

43
00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:24.996
Ji An.

44
00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:28.827
Let me hug you just once.

45
00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:31.836
What did you say?

46
00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:54.187
What... What's wrong?

47
00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:05.637
I understand why you're like this now.

48
00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:11.176
I understand why we can't work it out now.

49
00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:17.077
I...

50
00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.016
met Mr. Gong.

51
00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:38.637
I'm sorry I didn't know.

52
00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:42.167
I couldn't even imagine it.

53
00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:45.037
Why...

54
00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:46.907
Why would you...

55
00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:49.046
How did you...

56
00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:53.687
I didn't want you to know things like that.

57
00:03:55.146 --> 00:03:56.857
I didn't know you suffered that much.

58
00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:00.187
I didn't know...

59
00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:02.956
how much you suffered at my house.

60
00:04:05.456 --> 00:04:07.896
You were walking on a rope between life and death.

61
00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:11.197
Even though you said no,

62
00:04:12.907 --> 00:04:14.466
I thought you were just being proud...

63
00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:18.737
because you were afraid.

64
00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:25.177
Right.

65
00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:28.586
I tried to take my own life.

66
00:04:29.387 --> 00:04:31.317
But it wasn't because the Haesung family...

67
00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:33.456
or you made it miserable.

68
00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:36.827
I was ashamed of myself...

69
00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:40.067
for abandoning my siblings and parents...

70
00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:42.396
who raised me and loved me for 28 years...

71
00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:47.266
just because I was struggling.

72
00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:50.606
However,

73
00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:55.846
I had no place to go back...

74
00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:00.047
except to my parents and siblings.

75
00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:07.827
I saw my father getting beat by the vice chairman.

76
00:05:10.257 --> 00:05:12.827
I saw my father kneeling on the cold ground.

77
00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:17.666
Ji Soo.

78
00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:20.437
Ji Soo was like my other half,

79
00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:23.706
but she was hurt in a way beyond recovery.

80
00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:29.877
When the last string I held onto snapped,

81
00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.786
I had no more energy to carry on.

82
00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:35.016
Those horrible times as a job seeker,

83
00:05:35.016 --> 00:05:36.487
intern, and contract employee.

84
00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:40.026
I had no desire or strength to do it again.

85
00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:44.197
My choices...

86
00:05:44.197 --> 00:05:46.067
created that situation.

87
00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:49.396
So I hated myself.

88
00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:51.297
It was despising and humiliating.

89
00:05:52.737 --> 00:05:53.766
That's why...

90
00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:55.606
I wanted to end my life.

91
00:05:59.447 --> 00:06:00.776
The irony in that...

92
00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:02.916
was the realization when I thought I was dying.

93
00:06:03.747 --> 00:06:06.547
I realized that I'd lived a life full of regrets...

94
00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:09.716
and I had lived a wrong life.

95
00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:11.586
"Why did I lead such life?"

96
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.327
"Why did I always compare myself to others?"

97
00:06:15.487 --> 00:06:17.557
"Why didn't I revise my own standards?"

98
00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:22.367
You did the best you could.

99
00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:26.606
I'd lived without any purposes or goals.

100
00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:30.776
But after working at the dried laver farm,

101
00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.747
the world wasn't as scary as it was before.

102
00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:37.146
The workers' lives at the farm were valuable.

103
00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:39.117
They live a happy life.

104
00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:43.257
Without any expectations or ambition, I work...

105
00:06:43.817 --> 00:06:45.856
at this woodshop as I create things...

106
00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.526
and smell the wood, which I love.

107
00:06:50.197 --> 00:06:51.456
I'm starting to like my job more.

108
00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:54.396
And I also learned...

109
00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:56.567
what kind of person I was...

110
00:06:57.497 --> 00:06:58.797
and what I liked.

111
00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:03.637
I'm glad.

112
00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:06.476
Me too.

113
00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:09.916
So right now,

114
00:07:11.877 --> 00:07:13.117
I'm happy.

115
00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:17.617
What's troubling me the most now...

116
00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:21.726
is holding back my feelings for you.

117
00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:24.396
I know.

118
00:07:25.627 --> 00:07:26.797
I know that now.

119
00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:32.096
I realized why you can't be with me.

120
00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:35.776
It's because of who I am.

121
00:07:38.637 --> 00:07:40.807
I couldn't accept why you didn't want...

122
00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:43.016
someone like me.

123
00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:46.716
It's because of what I bring.

124
00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:50.456
I understand now.

125
00:07:53.057 --> 00:07:54.427
Cinderella doesn't exist.

126
00:07:55.156 --> 00:07:56.797
You said so yourself several times.

127
00:07:56.927 --> 00:07:58.697
"Nothing comes free in life."

128
00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:01.666
That's the rule of the Haesung family.

129
00:08:02.637 --> 00:08:06.706
Your world willingly divides classes.

130
00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:12.976
Since I know that rule so well,

131
00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:16.617
I can't put myself in your world just for love.

132
00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:18.216
And I don't want to either.

133
00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:22.487
I also believe that wouldn't be right.

134
00:08:24.656 --> 00:08:26.456
I'm living my own life now.

135
00:08:29.096 --> 00:08:30.327
Despite your feelings for me,

136
00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:34.726
this is why you didn't want...

137
00:08:37.336 --> 00:08:38.767
anything to do with me.

138
00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:40.937
Well,

139
00:08:41.307 --> 00:08:44.006
if you hadn't left your family,

140
00:08:44.476 --> 00:08:46.746
we could have dated for a while though.

141
00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:47.846
Secretly.

142
00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:49.277
Besides,

143
00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:52.586
we must date to know if we can be together or not.

144
00:08:53.787 --> 00:08:55.086
But your family...

145
00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:58.456
won't even allow me to date you...

146
00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.456
because they have already classified me as inferior.

147
00:09:02.756 --> 00:09:04.456
It must have been so hard for you.

148
00:09:06.297 --> 00:09:07.797
I only tried to date you.

149
00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:09.466
No.

150
00:09:10.136 --> 00:09:12.506
I know how hard it was for you to choose that.

151
00:09:12.767 --> 00:09:14.037
I thought my love would be enough for you.

152
00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:17.136
I had been silly and arrogant...

153
00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:20.706
to have thought like that.

154
00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:23.876
I had been short-sighted.

155
00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:28.447
I left my home...

156
00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:31.086
for my own gain.

157
00:09:33.057 --> 00:09:34.626
I didn't leave for your sake.

158
00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:40.527
I was never convinced that you didn't like my wealth.

159
00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:45.067
I kept thinking that in my head.

160
00:09:47.167 --> 00:09:48.767
I see how you would think that.

161
00:09:51.836 --> 00:09:53.147
If you come to my world,

162
00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:56.746
you will never be able to live as Seo Ji An.

163
00:09:59.187 --> 00:10:01.346
You will have to live according to our rules.

164
00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:04.456
As a daughter-in-law of the Haesung family.

165
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.456
As a wife of the heir, Choi Do Kyung.

166
00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:10.356
You will have to keep formalities.

167
00:10:12.397 --> 00:10:14.366
And you won't be able to get a job you want either.

168
00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:19.667
That is why I cannot cross over to your world.

169
00:10:22.037 --> 00:10:23.606
I cannot let you suffer.

170
00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:26.746
I don't have the right either.

171
00:10:29.447 --> 00:10:31.447
I don't have the right to ask you to come with me.

172
00:10:34.947 --> 00:10:35.956
So...

173
00:10:39.586 --> 00:10:41.386
I must stop bothering you now.

174
00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:47.327
I...

175
00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:53.136
don't believe I can make you happy, Ji An.

176
00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:02.777
It's because of who I am.

177
00:11:05.246 --> 00:11:06.386
Because I'm Choi Do Kyung.

178
00:11:16.697 --> 00:11:17.856
Starting now,

179
00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:23.067
I won't ask you to do anything with me.

180
00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:26.336
I can't.

181
00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:31.336
Thank you.

182
00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:34.476
And I'm sorry.

183
00:11:39.447 --> 00:11:40.616
From now on,

184
00:11:43.086 --> 00:11:44.586
I won't make you suffer anymore.

185
00:12:31.437 --> 00:12:33.706
Why are you drinking soju without a glass?

186
00:12:34.206 --> 00:12:35.407
There are glasses over here.

187
00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:36.937
Leave it.

188
00:14:05.557 --> 00:14:06.697
What was that?

189
00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:16.476
Ms. Seo.

190
00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:18.037
Can I take those?

191
00:14:18.476 --> 00:14:19.706
Yes, please.

192
00:14:33.027 --> 00:14:36.527
Hey, hey. This way. Come on.

193
00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:38.596
Hey, over here. Pass.

194
00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:41.267
- Catch the ball. - Over here.

195
00:14:47.437 --> 00:14:48.667
Hey, Seo Tae Soo.

196
00:14:49.407 --> 00:14:50.836
That's not going to get you anywhere.

197
00:14:53.447 --> 00:14:55.307
I heard there are guitar schools in Seoul.

198
00:14:56.346 --> 00:14:57.716
Quit dreaming, you punk.

199
00:14:57.716 --> 00:15:00.017
You're a delivery guy. You can't be a guitarist.

200
00:15:00.017 --> 00:15:01.216
Why would I quit dreaming?

201
00:15:01.547 --> 00:15:03.287
People are supposed to keep dreaming.

202
00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:06.557
No way. You won't be able to make it in Seoul.

203
00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:34.417
Hi, Dad. Were you visiting somewhere else?

204
00:15:35.216 --> 00:15:36.486
What is this now?

205
00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:39.256
Why are you taking turns to visit me now?

206
00:15:40.226 --> 00:15:43.427
Ji Ho told me the room was warm, but it's windy.

207
00:15:44.897 --> 00:15:46.626
So I brought an electric heater.

208
00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:47.966
Why?

209
00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:50.167
Are you worried now since I'm going to die soon?

210
00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:54.667
And there are some porridges in here.

211
00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:56.807
Since it's winter, you can leave it outside.

212
00:15:56.807 --> 00:15:57.836
Porridge?

213
00:15:58.506 --> 00:16:00.147
Your stomach is upset.

214
00:16:01.077 --> 00:16:02.876
I got this from the hospital.

215
00:16:02.876 --> 00:16:04.616
Take this after you have porridge.

216
00:16:05.447 --> 00:16:07.447
I don't need any of this.

217
00:16:08.216 --> 00:16:10.086
Why are you doing this now?

218
00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:12.527
Do you think I will be happy...

219
00:16:12.527 --> 00:16:14.086
and thankful that you care about me now?

220
00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:17.027
Stop it, will you?

221
00:16:17.797 --> 00:16:19.267
I am here alone because I don't want...

222
00:16:19.397 --> 00:16:20.496
to bother you as I die.

223
00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:22.067
I wanted to be alone for once.

224
00:16:23.437 --> 00:16:26.206
Why are you acting unusual?

225
00:16:27.267 --> 00:16:28.667
Do you think only you can hate me?

226
00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:30.236
I hate you too now.

227
00:16:30.437 --> 00:16:31.537
I hate you all.

228
00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:33.506
It's Sunday,

229
00:16:33.506 --> 00:16:35.746
so we came out for some fresh air and dropped by.

230
00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:40.647
I...

231
00:16:41.586 --> 00:16:43.017
I don't want any trouble.

232
00:16:44.157 --> 00:16:45.386
Don't bother me...

233
00:16:45.386 --> 00:16:47.027
only to make yourselves feel better.

234
00:16:47.886 --> 00:16:49.356
Don't come here anymore.

235
00:16:50.496 --> 00:16:52.126
We were just leaving anyway.

236
00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:54.567
Let's go, Mom.

237
00:16:54.697 --> 00:16:56.297
Okay. Let's go.

238
00:16:56.897 --> 00:16:57.897
Bye.

239
00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:03.707
Take care, Dad.

240
00:17:26.696 --> 00:17:28.896
(Buckwheat pancake batter)

241
00:17:35.267 --> 00:17:36.277
He must've been...

242
00:17:37.077 --> 00:17:39.146
very lonely until now.

243
00:17:41.507 --> 00:17:42.577
I never...

244
00:17:44.217 --> 00:17:45.846
saw him like that.

245
00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:49.457
He never yelled at me.

246
00:17:52.856 --> 00:17:54.287
What should we do with him?

247
00:17:57.596 --> 00:17:58.957
I am sorry, Mom.

248
00:18:02.737 --> 00:18:05.967
I never gave you a chance to explain...

249
00:18:07.807 --> 00:18:09.707
why you sent Ji An instead of Ji Soo.

250
00:18:12.077 --> 00:18:13.406
I should've listened...

251
00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:16.977
to what you had to say before I got upset at you.

252
00:18:51.017 --> 00:18:52.916
Thank you.

253
00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:55.217
Why did you come here in this cold?

254
00:18:57.457 --> 00:18:58.457
It's delicious.

255
00:18:59.156 --> 00:19:01.027
It's tough selling bread.

256
00:19:01.027 --> 00:19:02.727
I thought you could use something sweet.

257
00:19:02.827 --> 00:19:05.327
I am never low on sugar.

258
00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:09.136
You are my sugar. You are my Ms. Honey.

259
00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:11.836
Seriously, stop it.

260
00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:14.106
Ji Soo is going to laugh at us.

261
00:19:14.707 --> 00:19:16.037
What do those eyes mean?

262
00:19:16.037 --> 00:19:17.707
Are you laughing at us by any chance?

263
00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:20.807
No. It's just that you two are so sweet.

264
00:19:20.807 --> 00:19:22.977
I want to live like you two too.

265
00:19:23.446 --> 00:19:26.916
My goodness. With whom? With Hyuk?

266
00:19:27.686 --> 00:19:31.517
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

267
00:19:31.517 --> 00:19:33.656
What? That's a lie.

268
00:19:33.656 --> 00:19:34.957
You blushed as soon as you said it.

269
00:19:34.957 --> 00:19:37.027
- Look at you. - Come on.

270
00:19:37.997 --> 00:19:40.727
(Profile of Sunwoo Hyuk)

271
00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:42.467
(Family background)

272
00:19:43.737 --> 00:19:46.537
He runs a mom and pop store.

273
00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:49.737
His father was an alcoholic carpenter.

274
00:19:49.737 --> 00:19:51.207
(Sunwoo Hee)

275
00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:52.676
His sister divorced...

276
00:19:52.676 --> 00:19:54.547
her abusive husband and got married again.

277
00:19:54.547 --> 00:19:55.876
(Kang Nam Goo)

278
00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:58.416
And his brother-in-law is an orphan,

279
00:19:58.817 --> 00:20:00.146
who is a high school graduate.

280
00:20:01.987 --> 00:20:03.757
As if that's not enough...

281
00:20:12.727 --> 00:20:13.997
This woman...

282
00:20:14.267 --> 00:20:16.467
What about her?

283
00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:19.307
She knows Ji An.

284
00:20:20.606 --> 00:20:23.906
She seemed to know about Ji An and Do Kyung too.

285
00:20:24.636 --> 00:20:27.876
Sunwoo Hee's brother is dating Ji Soo.

286
00:20:29.176 --> 00:20:30.577
Then...

287
00:20:30.717 --> 00:20:33.247
Ji Soo might know about Ji An and Do Kyung.

288
00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:36.017
I don't know.

289
00:20:36.856 --> 00:20:39.827
Ji Soo is the one who told you about Hee's cafe.

290
00:20:40.727 --> 00:20:43.396
Would she have done that...

291
00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:45.396
if she knew about their relationship?

292
00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:52.707
Right. She didn't know Ji An's number.

293
00:20:53.537 --> 00:20:55.336
But they're all connected.

294
00:20:55.567 --> 00:20:57.176
So it's only a matter of time...

295
00:20:57.176 --> 00:20:58.477
until she finds out about Do Kyung and Ji An.

296
00:20:59.777 --> 00:21:01.676
They grew up many years as twins.

297
00:21:01.676 --> 00:21:03.747
What if they come together and protect Do Kyung?

298
00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:08.686
How can this happen?

299
00:21:10.757 --> 00:21:12.086
I am leaving now.

300
00:21:12.086 --> 00:21:13.327
What?

301
00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:15.557
Are you meeting her every day?

302
00:21:16.497 --> 00:21:18.396
If you're jealous, you should be in love too.

303
00:21:18.497 --> 00:21:19.567
Okay.

304
00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.166
I can't be jealous.

305
00:21:23.797 --> 00:21:24.896
This is it.

306
00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:28.037
No way.

307
00:21:28.406 --> 00:21:30.336
Did you make this?

308
00:21:30.336 --> 00:21:32.807
I once dreamt of becoming a sculptor.

309
00:21:33.507 --> 00:21:35.606
If it sells well, I will make you more.

310
00:21:35.606 --> 00:21:37.277
The first 10 customers...

311
00:21:37.277 --> 00:21:38.876
will be given handmade earrings.

312
00:21:38.876 --> 00:21:40.416
I should put a big sign.

313
00:21:41.116 --> 00:21:42.987
You are a good business man.

314
00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:45.886
But did you already get a place in a flea market?

315
00:21:45.886 --> 00:21:47.787
Well, there are no flea markets in winter,

316
00:21:47.787 --> 00:21:49.156
so I'll start selling things on the streets.

317
00:21:50.426 --> 00:21:52.767
That might be better for your experience.

318
00:21:53.096 --> 00:21:54.567
I have to go back to work.

319
00:21:54.567 --> 00:21:55.567
Okay.

320
00:21:58.737 --> 00:22:00.007
Isn't that Ji Soo's little brother?

321
00:22:00.007 --> 00:22:01.007
Ji An.

322
00:22:05.707 --> 00:22:06.777
Sister, wait.

323
00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:13.646
Thank you so much. I will try my best.

324
00:22:13.646 --> 00:22:15.616
Tell me how many earrings you sold.

325
00:22:15.616 --> 00:22:17.916
Yes, ma'am! I'll get going now.

326
00:22:26.896 --> 00:22:27.926
Ji An.

327
00:22:28.527 --> 00:22:31.067
Hyuk. Are you going somewhere?

328
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:32.767
Is he your brother?

329
00:22:32.767 --> 00:22:34.166
You saw my brother, Ji Ho.

330
00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:36.007
I should've introduced him to you.

331
00:22:37.436 --> 00:22:38.477
Seo Ji Ho.

332
00:22:40.906 --> 00:22:41.906
Then...

333
00:22:42.846 --> 00:22:43.977
who is Seo Ji Soo?

334
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:55.027
He's not here yet.

335
00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:16.176
Get in.

336
00:23:22.957 --> 00:23:24.817
What brings you here?

337
00:23:26.227 --> 00:23:28.586
I came to fetch you after your work.

338
00:23:30.257 --> 00:23:32.896
But I have plans today.

339
00:23:35.527 --> 00:23:36.537
With whom?

340
00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:38.596
Sunwoo Hyuk?

341
00:23:50.146 --> 00:23:51.946
I can't meet you today.

342
00:24:04.396 --> 00:24:05.896
I can't understand, Ji An.

343
00:24:07.027 --> 00:24:08.567
I know everything you went through.

344
00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:10.267
Why didn't you tell me about Ji Soo?

345
00:24:10.267 --> 00:24:11.267
No.

346
00:24:11.767 --> 00:24:13.836
Why did you pretend to not know each other?

347
00:24:17.477 --> 00:24:19.207
As you know,

348
00:24:20.406 --> 00:24:22.477
we were in a complicated situation.

349
00:24:23.846 --> 00:24:25.376
I felt uncomfortable to see Ji Soo,

350
00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:27.086
so I suggested that we pretend to be strangers.

351
00:24:27.686 --> 00:24:29.386
The movie night.

352
00:24:30.217 --> 00:24:31.616
Did you intentionally not show up?

353
00:24:33.156 --> 00:24:36.297
I thought you were attracted to her too.

354
00:24:36.297 --> 00:24:37.997
Ji Soo is the daughter of Haesung Corporation.

355
00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:39.866
Didn't you ever think about me?

356
00:24:39.997 --> 00:24:41.997
Ji Soo is living freely.

357
00:24:41.997 --> 00:24:44.467
It's different from when I was living there.

358
00:24:44.467 --> 00:24:46.166
They're letting her work at the bakery,

359
00:24:46.166 --> 00:24:47.866
and she's living as Seo Ji Soo.

360
00:24:48.767 --> 00:24:50.507
Perhaps it's because they almost...

361
00:24:50.507 --> 00:24:52.176
never got to find their real daughter.

362
00:24:52.336 --> 00:24:56.047
They acknowledge her and respect her as Ji Soo.

363
00:24:56.047 --> 00:24:59.446
Hey. This is a very important matter.

364
00:24:59.646 --> 00:25:01.446
It's about each other's background.

365
00:25:02.557 --> 00:25:04.457
When two people meet,

366
00:25:04.717 --> 00:25:07.656
I think your background matters a lot.

367
00:25:08.186 --> 00:25:09.497
Besides, I came to know...

368
00:25:09.727 --> 00:25:11.997
about that family through you.

369
00:25:12.596 --> 00:25:15.327
I am different from Ji Soo.

370
00:25:15.327 --> 00:25:17.467
That wasn't your decision to make.

371
00:25:19.707 --> 00:25:20.906
When you found out...

372
00:25:22.636 --> 00:25:24.906
that I knew Ji Soo,

373
00:25:25.477 --> 00:25:27.047
you should've told me.

374
00:25:29.077 --> 00:25:31.517
I am sorry for not telling you.

375
00:25:32.017 --> 00:25:34.616
I know why Do Kyung left home.

376
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:37.686
I heard what his mother did to you.

377
00:25:39.386 --> 00:25:41.757
Are you worried...

378
00:25:42.287 --> 00:25:43.957
that her family won't approve you?

379
00:25:43.957 --> 00:25:45.027
No.

380
00:25:45.997 --> 00:25:48.166
I should've been given the chance to choose...

381
00:25:48.166 --> 00:25:49.696
after being informed about who she is.

382
00:25:50.336 --> 00:25:51.366
If you're really my friend.

383
00:26:06.916 --> 00:26:09.287
He lost his mother as a young boy,

384
00:26:09.287 --> 00:26:11.257
and he's now a young businessman.

385
00:26:15.896 --> 00:26:17.027
So?

386
00:26:17.027 --> 00:26:19.096
He doesn't suit you.

387
00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:21.267
I like him.

388
00:26:22.096 --> 00:26:23.896
Your daughter likes him.

389
00:26:25.336 --> 00:26:27.267
Yes. You are my daughter.

390
00:26:27.467 --> 00:26:29.136
You are No Myung Hee's daughter.

391
00:26:30.077 --> 00:26:32.237
You were born as Choi Eun Seok.

392
00:26:35.176 --> 00:26:37.077
You've enjoyed your hobby enough.

393
00:26:37.077 --> 00:26:38.077
You're studying abroad.

394
00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:39.517
If you are my mom...

395
00:26:40.287 --> 00:26:41.517
Shouldn't a mother...

396
00:26:42.557 --> 00:26:45.186
wish for her daughter's happiness?

397
00:26:46.557 --> 00:26:48.727
I am doing this for your happiness.

398
00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:50.457
I told you.

399
00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:52.797
I want to live as Seo Ji Soo.

400
00:26:53.827 --> 00:26:55.366
When I was living at home,

401
00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:58.567
Ji An and I got along so well.

402
00:26:59.136 --> 00:27:00.606
Let's not waste time.

403
00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:03.537
Nobody compared me to Ji An.

404
00:27:03.577 --> 00:27:05.136
That's why we got along well.

405
00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:08.547
Ji An was the person I liked the most...

406
00:27:08.547 --> 00:27:09.717
after Mom and Dad.

407
00:27:14.747 --> 00:27:16.717
It was my mistake to enter this house.

408
00:27:18.717 --> 00:27:20.457
I am leaving this family.

409
00:27:21.057 --> 00:27:22.287
You don't have to get me a house.

410
00:27:25.426 --> 00:27:27.596
Hyuk's shopping mall, Hee's cafe,

411
00:27:27.596 --> 00:27:28.967
and Nam Goo's bakery.

412
00:27:30.436 --> 00:27:31.567
If they all end up...

413
00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:33.037
on the streets because of you,

414
00:27:34.336 --> 00:27:36.406
will Hyuk still like you?

415
00:27:41.477 --> 00:27:42.477
Ji Soo.

416
00:27:43.346 --> 00:27:44.646
Do you want that to happen?

417
00:27:45.346 --> 00:27:46.517
What do you mean?

418
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.787
What are you talking about?

419
00:27:50.057 --> 00:27:52.557
You have to learn things by studying abroad.

420
00:27:52.856 --> 00:27:53.886
But there's a reason for you...

421
00:27:53.886 --> 00:27:54.886
to not want to study abroad.

422
00:27:54.957 --> 00:27:56.926
I have to get rid of the cause, don't I?

423
00:27:56.926 --> 00:27:58.057
That's what a parent should do.

424
00:28:03.366 --> 00:28:05.297
(Ji An)

425
00:28:05.436 --> 00:28:06.967
You said she doesn't call you anymore.

426
00:28:09.277 --> 00:28:10.836
(Ji An)

427
00:28:14.007 --> 00:28:15.346
Think carefully.

428
00:28:22.086 --> 00:28:23.656
The number you have dialed is not available.

429
00:28:51.247 --> 00:28:52.817
That's quite a lot since I see it gathered.

430
00:28:55.487 --> 00:28:59.586
I heard you can upcycle wood pieces and sawdust.

431
00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:01.156
Pellet fuel, was it?

432
00:29:03.656 --> 00:29:04.696
Wait.

433
00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:08.327
Who takes the waste wood over there?

434
00:29:08.626 --> 00:29:09.767
The recycling company.

435
00:29:18.636 --> 00:29:20.646
The price is high because of the materials.

436
00:29:20.646 --> 00:29:21.946
- Is that right? - Yes.

437
00:29:22.376 --> 00:29:23.646
Do Kyung,

438
00:29:23.747 --> 00:29:25.116
- are you done? - Yes.

439
00:29:28.017 --> 00:29:29.787
Good job. And thank you.

440
00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:31.686
Thank you.

441
00:29:32.987 --> 00:29:34.327
I heard a new staff is coming,

442
00:29:34.426 --> 00:29:35.856
so this will be my last day.

443
00:29:36.957 --> 00:29:38.327
Mr. Sunwoo, Sun Tae,

444
00:29:38.957 --> 00:29:40.027
and Ji An,

445
00:29:40.827 --> 00:29:42.936
I'll be leaving now. Goodbye.

446
00:29:42.967 --> 00:29:44.136
You did well.

447
00:29:44.567 --> 00:29:45.737
Goodbye.

448
00:29:45.807 --> 00:29:47.237
You did well.

449
00:29:49.507 --> 00:29:50.507
I'll be leaving now.

450
00:29:51.537 --> 00:29:52.946
Where are you headed?

451
00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:03.057
(The first 10 people get handmade earrings.)

452
00:30:03.487 --> 00:30:06.027
Please come take a look.

453
00:30:06.086 --> 00:30:09.426
The first 10 customers will get these earrings.

454
00:30:09.926 --> 00:30:11.727
Here. Take a look.

455
00:30:11.727 --> 00:30:13.567
- You can try on the hat. - It's cold.

456
00:30:15.967 --> 00:30:17.836
Why did you wear so lightly?

457
00:30:19.166 --> 00:30:20.666
Wear your clothes.

458
00:30:21.267 --> 00:30:22.577
Yes, I should.

459
00:30:24.636 --> 00:30:25.946
Everything looks good.

460
00:30:27.277 --> 00:30:28.507
Isn't this good too?

461
00:30:32.946 --> 00:30:34.317
How much is that?

462
00:30:35.217 --> 00:30:36.656
This is 50 dollars.

463
00:30:36.656 --> 00:30:38.557
When you get this, you'll get earrings too.

464
00:30:38.957 --> 00:30:40.156
Really?

465
00:30:40.156 --> 00:30:41.386
I'll take it then.

466
00:30:41.586 --> 00:30:42.626
Okay.

467
00:30:44.327 --> 00:30:45.497
Give it to me.

468
00:30:45.926 --> 00:30:47.497
I will put it here for you. Here.

469
00:30:48.126 --> 00:30:49.696
Thank you for your purchase.

470
00:30:51.836 --> 00:30:53.106
I should wear one too.

471
00:30:56.077 --> 00:30:57.077
How do I look?

472
00:30:57.136 --> 00:31:00.146
Do I look hip?

473
00:31:01.307 --> 00:31:02.346
What does that mean?

474
00:31:03.017 --> 00:31:04.176
Gosh.

475
00:31:10.487 --> 00:31:12.926
This is 50 dollars, and this is 15 dollars.

476
00:31:12.926 --> 00:31:14.227
Aren't they pretty?

477
00:31:14.386 --> 00:31:17.057
This is the same design. It's 15 dollars.

478
00:31:17.596 --> 00:31:19.967
By any chance, are you two a couple?

479
00:31:19.967 --> 00:31:21.327
- No... - No way.

480
00:31:21.426 --> 00:31:23.396
She's my business partner.

481
00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:24.636
She's not my type, okay?

482
00:31:25.537 --> 00:31:27.336
- Wear it well. - I should be saying that.

483
00:31:27.336 --> 00:31:28.866
Wear the earrings well too.

484
00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:30.537
- Okay. - Thank you.

485
00:31:31.176 --> 00:31:33.747
Can you fix the earrings if they break?

486
00:31:33.747 --> 00:31:35.346
How can I reach you?

487
00:31:36.217 --> 00:31:37.346
Give me your phone.

488
00:31:37.876 --> 00:31:38.946
- Okay. - Okay.

489
00:31:40.487 --> 00:31:43.257
If you contact me here, I'll get them fixed.

490
00:31:43.317 --> 00:31:45.017
- Thank you. - Thank you.

491
00:31:45.057 --> 00:31:46.186
Bye.

492
00:31:46.186 --> 00:31:47.386
What?

493
00:31:52.126 --> 00:31:53.166
Thank you for letting me use your car.

494
00:31:55.797 --> 00:31:56.866
You can keep using it.

495
00:31:57.297 --> 00:31:58.696
You need a car to do business.

496
00:31:59.406 --> 00:32:01.037
I haven't even found a business item.

497
00:32:01.237 --> 00:32:03.537
It's because you are doing part-time jobs.

498
00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:05.636
Do you think it's easy to do something else...

499
00:32:05.636 --> 00:32:07.346
while making a living?

500
00:32:08.747 --> 00:32:11.017
I know. I realized that.

501
00:32:11.676 --> 00:32:14.386
Now, I understand the old saying,

502
00:32:14.386 --> 00:32:15.517
"A full belly counsels well."

503
00:32:15.717 --> 00:32:17.787
You should quit your job if you know now.

This is my bankbook. I have the down payment...

00:32:33.406 --> 00:32:34.737
for the apartment I bought and a bit more.

508
00:32:35.467 --> 00:32:38.077
I will invest in your business.

509
00:32:38.676 --> 00:32:40.406
- What? - Well,

510
00:32:40.676 --> 00:32:42.106
I got a loan with no interest,

511
00:32:42.106 --> 00:32:43.116
so it's quite a sum.

512
00:32:43.346 --> 00:32:44.416
It's more than 200,000 dollars.

513
00:32:45.116 --> 00:32:47.186
It's everything my mother and I saved.

514
00:32:47.517 --> 00:32:49.017
I will trust you and invest in your business.

515
00:32:49.987 --> 00:32:51.057
I have only six months until I move...

516
00:32:51.057 --> 00:32:52.116
to the new apartment.

517
00:32:53.957 --> 00:32:55.227
Gwan Woo.

518
00:32:55.227 --> 00:32:57.997
If you fail to succeed in six months,

519
00:32:57.997 --> 00:32:59.997
you'll surrender and go home anyway.

520
00:33:00.196 --> 00:33:01.797
Then you will pay me back.

521
00:33:02.636 --> 00:33:03.767
So I am not afraid.

522
00:33:05.067 --> 00:33:06.307
But...

523
00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:09.007
But still,

524
00:33:10.977 --> 00:33:13.007
how could you invest your everything in me?

525
00:33:13.376 --> 00:33:15.747
When my mom got a hip surgery,

526
00:33:16.217 --> 00:33:17.777
you paid for it.

527
00:33:20.247 --> 00:33:21.446
But I didn't do that because...

528
00:33:21.446 --> 00:33:22.487
I really cared about you.

529
00:33:23.487 --> 00:33:25.856
It was out of my duty as your boss.

530
00:33:26.327 --> 00:33:27.856
I was just pretending to be nice.

531
00:33:29.027 --> 00:33:30.257
I know.

532
00:33:30.557 --> 00:33:32.827
Do you think I'm mistaking your actions...

533
00:33:33.027 --> 00:33:34.797
of helping the less fortunate...

534
00:33:34.797 --> 00:33:37.767
as something you sincerely meant?

535
00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:40.836
Honestly, you just did it to show off.

536
00:33:41.406 --> 00:33:42.507
Right.

537
00:33:43.106 --> 00:33:44.136
So why?

538
00:33:44.636 --> 00:33:48.106
It is still a big help for someone struggling.

539
00:33:52.416 --> 00:33:53.646
But I will consider myself employed...

540
00:33:53.646 --> 00:33:54.886
starting today.

541
00:33:58.616 --> 00:34:00.057
I will serve you well as your secretary...

542
00:34:00.057 --> 00:34:01.356
and your driver.

543
00:34:08.066 --> 00:34:09.066
Then...

544
00:34:09.337 --> 00:34:10.897
can you start with research?

545
00:34:11.596 --> 00:34:13.437
I am still not sure about it,

546
00:34:13.466 --> 00:34:14.736
but I'm interested in something.

547
00:34:16.207 --> 00:34:17.207
Sure.

548
00:34:27.046 --> 00:34:28.046
Father.

549
00:34:31.417 --> 00:34:32.457
Hello.

550
00:34:32.457 --> 00:34:33.926
You go up. Sit down, Ms. No.

551
00:34:40.096 --> 00:34:42.466
Is it time to have a good time with her?

552
00:34:44.997 --> 00:34:46.837
What brings you here?

553
00:34:47.566 --> 00:34:49.066
You should've told me.

554
00:34:49.877 --> 00:34:51.136
What happened to Do Kyung?

555
00:34:51.877 --> 00:34:52.946
Did you find the girl?

556
00:34:54.006 --> 00:34:56.046
No. Not yet.

557
00:34:58.647 --> 00:34:59.647
Really?

558
00:35:01.386 --> 00:35:02.417
I am sorry.

559
00:35:04.957 --> 00:35:07.986
Do Kyung has turned on his phone again.

560
00:35:08.727 --> 00:35:11.296
It seems like he's around the area near Hongdae.

561
00:35:12.357 --> 00:35:14.327
What do you think that would mean?

562
00:35:17.437 --> 00:35:19.066
Does it mean he doesn't care if we find out?

563
00:35:20.767 --> 00:35:21.966
I don't know.

564
00:35:22.607 --> 00:35:25.337
Perhaps he's trying to start a business?

565
00:35:25.437 --> 00:35:26.607
How?

566
00:35:27.276 --> 00:35:29.747
I cut off all his investments.

567
00:35:30.116 --> 00:35:31.977
He should surrender and come home then.

568
00:35:32.546 --> 00:35:34.087
But he freely goes around while using his phone.

569
00:35:34.747 --> 00:35:35.756
Something's up.

570
00:35:37.616 --> 00:35:38.656
Myung Hee,

571
00:35:39.687 --> 00:35:41.127
tell me everything you found out until now.

572
00:35:42.156 --> 00:35:44.827
Do Kyung has his pride, Father.

573
00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:46.667
He left home proudly.

574
00:35:46.727 --> 00:35:48.627
He won't come back in less than a month.

575
00:35:49.366 --> 00:35:51.136
He's went around looking for investors.

576
00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:53.267
He doesn't have any money.

577
00:35:53.267 --> 00:35:54.866
And his phone is on...

578
00:35:54.866 --> 00:35:57.337
because he doesn't have anything special going on.

579
00:35:57.377 --> 00:36:00.406
Isn't that right? Don't you think so too?

580
00:36:00.647 --> 00:36:01.647
I'm not sure.

581
00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:06.716
He'll be back soon.

582
00:36:07.147 --> 00:36:09.116
He didn't even call Gi Jae.

583
00:36:09.287 --> 00:36:11.017
You know he has a strong pride, right?

584
00:36:11.017 --> 00:36:12.957
He'd never ask anyone for help.

585
00:36:14.227 --> 00:36:16.997
He knows it'd leak to the company soon.

586
00:36:17.227 --> 00:36:18.627
I'm sure he will come back soon.

587
00:36:30.207 --> 00:36:31.877
What do you think you are doing?

588
00:36:32.077 --> 00:36:34.477
If Father finds out Do Kyung left home...

589
00:36:34.477 --> 00:36:36.077
because of Ji An,

590
00:36:36.077 --> 00:36:37.477
he will be doomed.

591
00:36:37.477 --> 00:36:39.846
Father might really abandon Do Kyung.

592
00:36:40.787 --> 00:36:41.917
That's possible.

593
00:36:42.457 --> 00:36:43.886
Then why would you stay quiet?

594
00:36:43.886 --> 00:36:45.557
Are you just going to sit back and watch?

595
00:36:45.857 --> 00:36:48.827
You should make Father trust you.

596
00:36:48.827 --> 00:36:50.227
What's wrong with you these days?

597
00:36:50.227 --> 00:36:51.957
I don't want to try to satisfy your father...

598
00:36:51.957 --> 00:36:53.566
while walking on eggshells.

599
00:36:54.397 --> 00:36:55.596
What did you say?

600
00:36:55.596 --> 00:36:58.037
Is it your fault that you were born as a woman?

601
00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:00.466
Just because he doesn't have a son,

602
00:37:00.466 --> 00:37:02.577
he makes you and your sister...

603
00:37:03.107 --> 00:37:05.377
eat out of the palm of his hand...

604
00:37:05.377 --> 00:37:07.577
by using Haesung Corporation.

605
00:37:07.577 --> 00:37:08.846
I'm sick of it now.

606
00:37:10.216 --> 00:37:13.546
Are you saying Jin Hee and I are his puppets?

607
00:37:15.486 --> 00:37:16.917
You don't know you are his puppet...

608
00:37:16.917 --> 00:37:18.656
because you've been raised that way.

609
00:37:18.656 --> 00:37:20.386
You'd think it's your own desire.

610
00:37:20.386 --> 00:37:22.227
Jae Sung, watch your mouth.

611
00:37:24.026 --> 00:37:25.827
If you've held your place as the president sooner,

612
00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:27.526
none of this would've happened.

613
00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:28.997
Do Kyung could've succeeded you...

614
00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:31.096
as the president of Haesung Corporation.

615
00:37:31.096 --> 00:37:32.767
Do you have anyone to share your secrets?

616
00:37:35.466 --> 00:37:38.477
You have a father, a sister, and a husband,

617
00:37:38.477 --> 00:37:40.046
but you don't have anyone to share your secrets.

618
00:37:43.116 --> 00:37:44.977
Only those who can't control their feelings...

619
00:37:44.977 --> 00:37:46.087
count on others.

620
00:37:47.147 --> 00:37:48.316
That's foolish.

621
00:37:48.647 --> 00:37:50.716
Then you wouldn't need my advice, right?

622
00:38:13.046 --> 00:38:14.077
I give up.

623
00:38:14.877 --> 00:38:15.917
What do you mean?

624
00:38:16.417 --> 00:38:17.776
When you ran away from home,

625
00:38:18.616 --> 00:38:21.546
I didn't think you'd hold out for a month.

626
00:38:21.787 --> 00:38:23.557
It took me some time to scrape up some money...

627
00:38:23.557 --> 00:38:24.816
without telling my parents.

628
00:38:25.287 --> 00:38:26.627
I already got the fund.

629
00:38:27.386 --> 00:38:29.656
Gosh, you're surprising.

630
00:38:30.327 --> 00:38:33.926
Then are you going out with Ji An now?

631
00:38:35.596 --> 00:38:37.167
Ji An and I broke up.

632
00:38:37.466 --> 00:38:40.167
Broke up? What does that mean?

633
00:38:40.866 --> 00:38:42.066
I let her go.

634
00:38:44.136 --> 00:38:45.877
I gave up on her.

635
00:38:46.906 --> 00:38:48.147
Are you serious?

636
00:38:49.477 --> 00:38:52.077
I'm serious, so I'm sad.

637
00:38:53.716 --> 00:38:55.316
She said...

638
00:38:56.716 --> 00:38:58.756
she didn't like you because you're rich.

639
00:38:58.917 --> 00:39:00.557
Did she really mean that?

640
00:39:37.457 --> 00:39:38.457
Dad.

641
00:39:53.546 --> 00:39:55.816
I made a drawer for you.

642
00:39:55.816 --> 00:39:57.247
I'll just leave it here and go.

643
00:39:57.247 --> 00:39:58.776
Don't bring in anything.

644
00:40:05.156 --> 00:40:06.156
Come have a seat.

645
00:40:13.426 --> 00:40:16.136
Do you all think I'm not serious?

646
00:40:18.337 --> 00:40:19.506
I'm sorry.

647
00:40:20.207 --> 00:40:22.136
Why did you make the drawer?

648
00:40:22.676 --> 00:40:24.377
Did you think I'd like it?

649
00:40:24.937 --> 00:40:26.207
Don't be mistaken.

650
00:40:26.747 --> 00:40:28.307
I'm a human being too.

651
00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:30.977
As a father, I can give you...

652
00:40:30.977 --> 00:40:32.716
everything you need.

653
00:40:32.716 --> 00:40:35.616
I'd even give you my guts if you want.

654
00:40:36.386 --> 00:40:37.787
Still, I'm a human being.

655
00:40:38.557 --> 00:40:41.087
Sometimes I feel upset and miserable too.

656
00:40:43.627 --> 00:40:45.457
So just go, would you?

657
00:40:45.696 --> 00:40:47.327
If you ever come again,

658
00:40:47.327 --> 00:40:49.096
I'll go somewhere else.

659
00:40:51.167 --> 00:40:52.267
Okay.

660
00:40:53.337 --> 00:40:54.767
And take that with you.

661
00:40:57.006 --> 00:40:59.276
But this is too heavy.

662
00:41:00.906 --> 00:41:02.077
I'll go now.

663
00:41:04.377 --> 00:41:05.917
Oh, right. Dad.

664
00:41:05.917 --> 00:41:07.986
Do you have a flashlight?

665
00:41:07.986 --> 00:41:10.116
My phone ran out of battery.

666
00:41:10.116 --> 00:41:12.957
It's too dark outside.

667
00:41:23.736 --> 00:41:25.767
Hold it to your side.

668
00:41:33.877 --> 00:41:36.676
Ji Soo is so unfortunate.

669
00:41:37.546 --> 00:41:40.147
There's a guy Ji Soo really likes.

670
00:41:40.986 --> 00:41:43.616
But it might not work because of her background.

671
00:41:45.486 --> 00:41:48.156
And Ji Ho lost 5,000 dollars.

672
00:41:48.627 --> 00:41:50.557
What... What?

673
00:41:50.596 --> 00:41:52.796
It was a franchise swindle.

674
00:41:52.796 --> 00:41:54.296
He lost the deposit.

675
00:41:54.426 --> 00:41:56.167
A... A franchise?

676
00:41:57.096 --> 00:41:59.736
I told him to be careful.

677
00:42:00.236 --> 00:42:03.636
I'm glad that he lost only 5,000 dollars though.

678
00:42:03.636 --> 00:42:05.707
He must be out of his mind.

679
00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:07.906
I know.

680
00:42:13.116 --> 00:42:15.446
Did you meet Ji Soo?

681
00:42:16.756 --> 00:42:17.787
Yes.

682
00:42:18.816 --> 00:42:21.187
Things are still a little awkward,

683
00:42:22.256 --> 00:42:23.857
but I'll make up with her soon.

684
00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:26.526
I'll meet Ji Soo and talk with her.

685
00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:31.136
Okay. Make sure to console her.

686
00:42:33.136 --> 00:42:35.537
Okay. I'll do that.

687
00:42:44.917 --> 00:42:46.846
Hyuk's shopping mall, Hee's cafe,

688
00:42:46.846 --> 00:42:48.046
and Nam Goo's bakery.

689
00:42:48.587 --> 00:42:49.687
If they all end up...

690
00:42:49.687 --> 00:42:51.017
on the streets because of you,

691
00:42:51.417 --> 00:42:53.426
will Hyuk still like you?

692
00:42:55.057 --> 00:42:56.827
Did she really mean that?

693
00:42:58.227 --> 00:43:00.566
What should I do? What should I do?

694
00:43:01.727 --> 00:43:03.296
Who should I talk to?

695
00:43:04.366 --> 00:43:06.136
Should I call Ji An?

696
00:43:16.377 --> 00:43:17.417
(Ji An)

697
00:43:18.977 --> 00:43:20.546
Why did she call me so many times?

698
00:43:20.647 --> 00:43:22.616
(Ji An)

699
00:43:22.616 --> 00:43:24.116
Ji Soo, give me a call.

700
00:43:25.587 --> 00:43:28.057
Ji Soo, your phone is off.

701
00:43:29.526 --> 00:43:32.696
Hyuk found out about you and me.

702
00:43:33.897 --> 00:43:35.566
He must've recognized Ji Ho.

703
00:43:36.136 --> 00:43:37.636
He seems shocked.

704
00:43:42.906 --> 00:43:45.736
Nam Goo, my brother-in-law.

705
00:43:46.776 --> 00:43:48.477
Do you love my sister that much?

706
00:43:48.546 --> 00:43:50.647
Yes. I love her beyond words.

707
00:43:50.647 --> 00:43:52.486
I'm so happy that I don't even mind dying.

708
00:43:54.346 --> 00:43:56.857
I can't even imagine what it feels like.

709
00:43:57.557 --> 00:43:58.886
Give me some examples.

710
00:44:02.127 --> 00:44:05.026
After your sister left me,

711
00:44:05.526 --> 00:44:08.096
I tried to date other girls too.

712
00:44:09.366 --> 00:44:11.366
But I felt so sorry for them.

713
00:44:11.366 --> 00:44:13.366
So I couldn't go out with anyone.

714
00:44:14.236 --> 00:44:17.006
I couldn't forget Hee and move on.

715
00:44:19.207 --> 00:44:22.716
That means I'm not so much in love.

716
00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:24.647
What do you mean?

717
00:44:24.647 --> 00:44:25.917
It's about Ji Soo and me.

718
00:44:27.287 --> 00:44:28.886
We're not that serious.

719
00:44:29.587 --> 00:44:31.986
Gosh, you're being ridiculous.

720
00:44:32.316 --> 00:44:34.886
Just speak it out. What's going on?

721
00:44:51.337 --> 00:44:53.546
In our family, Grandfather speaks the law,

722
00:44:53.546 --> 00:44:55.747
the truth, and directions. He is absolute.

723
00:44:56.377 --> 00:44:58.877
Mom, Dad, and Do Kyung can't go against him too.

724
00:45:00.517 --> 00:45:02.656
I don't want to be introduced,

725
00:45:02.656 --> 00:45:04.687
and I don't want to meet other people either.

726
00:45:05.017 --> 00:45:08.386
I'm not even ready to live my life as Choi Eun Seok.

727
00:45:09.057 --> 00:45:10.196
It's your grandfather's wish.

728
00:45:10.196 --> 00:45:11.457
I hope you'll comply.

729
00:45:11.526 --> 00:45:12.596
Shut your mouth!

730
00:45:13.196 --> 00:45:15.227
Please consult us for one last time.

731
00:45:15.296 --> 00:45:18.566
When you didn't do anything until...

732
00:45:18.566 --> 00:45:20.406
the family's only son ran away from home?

733
00:45:28.446 --> 00:45:29.477
Ji Soo.

734
00:45:30.877 --> 00:45:32.486
Did you want to see me?

735
00:45:32.546 --> 00:45:34.417
Do you have anything to say?

736
00:45:34.846 --> 00:45:37.417
No, never mind. Goodnight.

737
00:45:47.096 --> 00:45:49.026
81, 82, and 83.

738
00:45:50.296 --> 00:45:52.366
We earned 830 dollars.

739
00:45:53.607 --> 00:45:54.807
What's important...

740
00:45:55.566 --> 00:45:57.406
is that we sold out.

741
00:45:57.537 --> 00:46:00.176
Ji Ho, master of sales.

742
00:46:01.406 --> 00:46:03.747
My clothes are designer labels,

743
00:46:03.747 --> 00:46:05.517
so they made what you bought good.

744
00:46:05.917 --> 00:46:09.087
Hey, were your clothes real designer labels?

745
00:46:09.557 --> 00:46:10.917
No one recognized them.

746
00:46:11.187 --> 00:46:13.156
They aren't the labels you'd recognize.

747
00:46:13.787 --> 00:46:16.296
The first coat I wore cost 3,000 dollars.

748
00:46:16.426 --> 00:46:18.127
And I think the scarf cost about 800 dollars.

749
00:46:18.596 --> 00:46:21.227
You idiot, you should've told me so.

750
00:46:21.227 --> 00:46:22.636
If we sold such things second-hand...

751
00:46:23.196 --> 00:46:25.267
You said this was about the experience.

752
00:46:25.736 --> 00:46:28.566
I don't wear them, so I would've thrown them out.

753
00:46:31.207 --> 00:46:33.647
You don't value money at all.

754
00:46:34.207 --> 00:46:36.417
I doubt this means anything.

755
00:46:43.017 --> 00:46:44.857
But here, 70 dollars for the day.

756
00:46:46.486 --> 00:46:47.627
70 dollars?

757
00:46:47.787 --> 00:46:49.557
Leave it, that's a joke.

758
00:46:54.227 --> 00:46:55.937
Was this the first time you worked?

759
00:47:02.537 --> 00:47:03.906
The price of your labor...

760
00:47:05.946 --> 00:47:06.946
is money.

761
00:47:08.307 --> 00:47:11.446
I just taught you a lesson, so take it.

762
00:47:29.997 --> 00:47:32.437
Is your first pay that special?

763
00:47:46.116 --> 00:47:47.486
Gosh, save me.

764
00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:02.596
It's your day off. When will you come home?

765
00:48:03.767 --> 00:48:05.696
I'll be back by 6pm.

766
00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:08.667
See you later.

767
00:48:22.417 --> 00:48:23.417
You're not ready yet?

768
00:48:23.917 --> 00:48:26.187
- I parked outside. - Okay. Thanks.

769
00:48:26.256 --> 00:48:28.357
What did you talk about while drinking yesterday?

770
00:48:28.526 --> 00:48:30.156
Nam Goo says you only drank.

771
00:48:30.256 --> 00:48:32.696
We just talked about life.

772
00:48:33.127 --> 00:48:34.327
You're going to Insa-dong?

773
00:48:34.327 --> 00:48:35.767
There's a nice traditional tea shop.

774
00:48:35.767 --> 00:48:36.997
I'll text you the address.

775
00:48:37.736 --> 00:48:38.736
Thanks.

776
00:48:38.736 --> 00:48:40.566
The manager comes in at 4pm.

777
00:48:40.566 --> 00:48:42.906
Thanks for watching the cafe until then.

778
00:48:43.377 --> 00:48:45.337
No problem. Enjoy your date.

779
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.316
Welcome.

780
00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:52.377
I'm here...

781
00:48:52.377 --> 00:48:54.316
to see the owner.

782
00:48:54.316 --> 00:48:55.957
Ms. Yang Mi Jung.

783
00:48:57.687 --> 00:49:00.026
She resigned.

784
00:49:00.787 --> 00:49:02.327
She resigned?

785
00:49:02.796 --> 00:49:04.457
When? Why?

786
00:49:05.457 --> 00:49:07.196
Who are you?

787
00:49:09.497 --> 00:49:10.837
I'm her daughter.

788
00:49:11.897 --> 00:49:13.136
You didn't know?

789
00:49:13.466 --> 00:49:16.307
Haesung FNB's CEO suddenly came over...

790
00:49:16.307 --> 00:49:17.707
and told her to quit.

791
00:49:46.267 --> 00:49:48.337
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

792
00:49:49.337 --> 00:49:51.107
I was going to tell you...

793
00:49:51.107 --> 00:49:52.846
when I was ready.

794
00:49:53.006 --> 00:49:55.446
When would you have been ready?

795
00:49:56.877 --> 00:49:57.977
First,

796
00:49:58.147 --> 00:50:00.417
we can get to know each other...

797
00:50:00.446 --> 00:50:02.716
What if we got really close?

798
00:50:05.486 --> 00:50:06.557
You...

799
00:50:07.386 --> 00:50:08.827
liked me for a long time.

800
00:50:09.727 --> 00:50:11.426
It took me a while to open up.

801
00:50:13.767 --> 00:50:16.136
Were you going to break up with me easily?

802
00:50:21.066 --> 00:50:22.107
No.

803
00:50:22.837 --> 00:50:24.707
Then you should've told me from the start.

804
00:50:26.846 --> 00:50:28.647
It wasn't easy.

805
00:50:29.946 --> 00:50:32.687
You and Ji An had been friends for years.

806
00:50:33.886 --> 00:50:35.647
What Ji An told me...

807
00:50:36.656 --> 00:50:38.287
was that your mom made a mistake,

808
00:50:38.917 --> 00:50:41.087
Ji An ended up in that house,

809
00:50:41.857 --> 00:50:43.827
and realized she wasn't their real daughter.

810
00:50:45.966 --> 00:50:47.497
So she left,

811
00:50:48.296 --> 00:50:51.366
and the real daughter joined the Haesung family.

812
00:50:51.437 --> 00:50:52.466
That was it.

813
00:50:53.937 --> 00:50:55.837
I don't know what else there is between you.

814
00:50:57.506 --> 00:50:58.837
Did you not tell me...

815
00:50:59.406 --> 00:51:00.477
because of Ji An?

816
00:51:00.977 --> 00:51:03.647
No... No, it's not that.

817
00:51:04.077 --> 00:51:05.577
Then you knew...

818
00:51:06.647 --> 00:51:08.816
that if I found out you're a Haesung family member...

819
00:51:10.057 --> 00:51:11.486
that I'd feel unworthy.

820
00:51:12.316 --> 00:51:13.357
Right?

821
00:51:14.827 --> 00:51:16.426
I wanted to get closer to you...

822
00:51:17.557 --> 00:51:20.397
and get along without the added stress.

823
00:51:21.696 --> 00:51:23.096
And then...

824
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:25.196
Tell me once we were deeply involved?

825
00:51:29.006 --> 00:51:30.437
I think that's it.

826
00:51:32.477 --> 00:51:33.577
Ji Soo.

827
00:51:34.807 --> 00:51:36.747
If your family found out about me,

828
00:51:37.377 --> 00:51:38.676
would they approve?

829
00:51:45.057 --> 00:51:46.087
I heard...

830
00:51:47.426 --> 00:51:49.897
from others about how that family does things.

831
00:51:50.756 --> 00:51:52.466
I also heard about how they live...

832
00:51:53.227 --> 00:51:56.397
and how they treat and control their kids.

833
00:51:59.607 --> 00:52:00.636
I...

834
00:52:03.136 --> 00:52:04.477
don't want that kind of relationship.

835
00:52:16.417 --> 00:52:17.917
Do you want...

836
00:52:18.716 --> 00:52:20.187
to break up?

837
00:52:21.756 --> 00:52:23.627
Whether it's dating or loving,

838
00:52:26.497 --> 00:52:28.727
I think it's best when it's positive either way.

839
00:52:31.096 --> 00:52:32.296
Okay.

840
00:52:35.006 --> 00:52:36.937
To be honest, I thought...

841
00:52:38.437 --> 00:52:40.346
that we were just dating...

842
00:52:41.707 --> 00:52:44.816
and we could break up after dating for a while.

843
00:52:47.587 --> 00:52:49.256
So don't feel any pressure.

844
00:52:59.926 --> 00:53:01.366
Mr. Sunwoo, I'm here.

845
00:53:03.066 --> 00:53:04.267
I should go then.

846
00:53:08.406 --> 00:53:09.577
- Take care. - Thank you.

847
00:54:14.506 --> 00:54:17.837
What now? I feel so sorry for Tae Soo.

848
00:54:19.276 --> 00:54:22.207
Hae Ja, it's in his mind.

849
00:54:22.776 --> 00:54:24.546
He doesn't have cancer.

850
00:54:24.546 --> 00:54:26.017
He won't die.

851
00:54:26.017 --> 00:54:27.946
That's why I feel sorry for him.

852
00:54:29.656 --> 00:54:31.616
How badly must he have wanted to die...

853
00:54:32.557 --> 00:54:34.127
for someone as strong as him...

854
00:54:36.796 --> 00:54:38.997
When you got so upset with him,

855
00:54:38.997 --> 00:54:40.366
I knew this would happen.

856
00:54:42.167 --> 00:54:43.966
Was I upset with him?

857
00:54:44.066 --> 00:54:46.337
You were. Because he didn't earn as much.

858
00:54:47.707 --> 00:54:49.776
You nagged him to start another business.

859
00:54:52.077 --> 00:54:54.377
Because he had been so capable.

860
00:54:55.307 --> 00:54:56.846
I did push him a lot.

861
00:54:57.417 --> 00:54:59.946
I shouldn't have set you two up.

862
00:55:01.417 --> 00:55:02.917
I've never seen...

863
00:55:04.116 --> 00:55:06.256
another man like Tae Soo, who never...

864
00:55:06.256 --> 00:55:09.526
so much as raised his voice to his wife.

865
00:55:09.627 --> 00:55:11.057
Never.

866
00:55:11.526 --> 00:55:13.667
So I'm paying for that dearly.

867
00:55:14.596 --> 00:55:16.437
I can't visit when I want...

868
00:55:17.236 --> 00:55:18.537
or ask him to come back.

869
00:55:20.236 --> 00:55:21.437
You deserve it.

870
00:55:26.077 --> 00:55:27.877
- See you tomorrow. - Bye.

871
00:55:40.486 --> 00:55:42.557
- Ji Tae. - Hello.

872
00:55:43.256 --> 00:55:45.426
I'm sorry Soo A's staying with you.

873
00:55:47.196 --> 00:55:48.267
Why are you here?

874
00:55:48.267 --> 00:55:49.636
To take you home.

875
00:55:49.937 --> 00:55:51.537
Both you and her.

876
00:55:57.607 --> 00:55:59.707
Are you watching so I can't get an abortion?

877
00:55:59.707 --> 00:56:00.747
Yes, I am.

878
00:56:01.346 --> 00:56:03.517
Come along. I'll take you both.

879
00:56:03.616 --> 00:56:04.846
Okay.

880
00:56:05.886 --> 00:56:06.986
Let's go.

881
00:56:26.906 --> 00:56:28.437
Here. Take this.

882
00:56:29.837 --> 00:56:31.807
You have to take it during the early stage.

883
00:56:32.607 --> 00:56:34.046
And don't skip any meals.

884
00:56:38.846 --> 00:56:40.116
See you tomorrow.

885
00:56:40.486 --> 00:56:42.147
- Goodbye. - Bye.

886
00:57:05.577 --> 00:57:06.846
What'll you do?

887
00:57:07.647 --> 00:57:09.316
I think he's serious.

888
00:57:10.877 --> 00:57:11.977
Seo Ji Tae...

889
00:57:13.087 --> 00:57:14.787
How could he?

890
00:57:16.816 --> 00:57:18.886
How could he give up on me like that?

891
00:57:20.756 --> 00:57:22.426
How could he divorce...

892
00:57:23.957 --> 00:57:27.296
I think he took what you said at face value.

893
00:57:27.767 --> 00:57:29.337
How could he?

894
00:57:29.796 --> 00:57:31.796
After what we went through to get married?

895
00:57:33.966 --> 00:57:35.736
I thought I'd give in...

896
00:57:37.006 --> 00:57:38.906
if he kept saying we should give birth,

897
00:57:40.247 --> 00:57:41.846
so I asked for a divorce...

898
00:57:41.846 --> 00:57:43.647
to make him change his mind.

899
00:57:47.647 --> 00:57:49.357
He's really considering it.

900
00:57:50.957 --> 00:57:52.057
This is unbelievable.

901
00:57:53.886 --> 00:57:55.897
How could he pick the child...

902
00:57:55.897 --> 00:57:57.457
whom he can't even see?

903
00:58:00.127 --> 00:58:01.296
But what'll you do...

904
00:58:01.627 --> 00:58:03.736
if he keeps checking on you...

905
00:58:03.937 --> 00:58:05.236
every day?

906
00:58:08.437 --> 00:58:10.207
I'll have to make a decision.

907
00:58:15.506 --> 00:58:18.377
I'll stay only until the end of this month.

908
00:58:19.647 --> 00:58:21.647
Will you go back home?

909
00:58:22.147 --> 00:58:25.057
Yes. You can look for a new tenant.

910
00:58:34.466 --> 00:58:35.566
Hyuk.

911
00:58:42.537 --> 00:58:43.537
I...

912
00:58:44.837 --> 00:58:46.107
broke up with Ji Soo.

913
00:58:49.577 --> 00:58:51.017
How is she?

914
00:58:51.577 --> 00:58:54.517
Is Ji Soo okay?

915
00:58:55.957 --> 00:58:57.816
Let's not talk about it anymore, Ji An.

916
00:59:06.727 --> 00:59:08.267
Poor Ji Soo.

917
00:59:21.346 --> 00:59:23.917
(Young Entrepreneur Making DIY Furniture for Singles)

918
00:59:42.796 --> 00:59:46.506
You'll do well whatever you do in the future.

919
00:59:47.136 --> 00:59:49.066
I'll watch you from afar...

920
00:59:49.736 --> 00:59:51.736
and sincerely wish you well.

921
00:59:52.107 --> 00:59:53.477
Bread Pit.

922
01:00:09.596 --> 01:00:10.627
Ma'am.

923
01:00:11.696 --> 01:00:13.026
Are you going out?

924
01:00:13.267 --> 01:00:14.827
It's my day off.

925
01:00:15.426 --> 01:00:17.566
- This is... - You'll take a day off?

926
01:00:19.037 --> 01:00:20.466
I told you to find Ji An...

927
01:00:20.466 --> 01:00:22.437
and you still haven't.

928
01:00:22.977 --> 01:00:25.846
We must find her to find Do Kyung.

929
01:00:25.846 --> 01:00:27.747
Didn't you hear my father?

930
01:00:29.247 --> 01:00:30.546
Find Ji An first.

931
01:00:31.676 --> 01:00:33.946
I only get one day a month off.

932
01:00:34.116 --> 01:00:36.357
My father looks forward to my visit.

933
01:00:37.287 --> 01:00:40.156
Nothing will happen if you're a few days late.

934
01:00:41.386 --> 01:00:43.827
Visiting my father isn't all I do.

935
01:00:43.827 --> 01:00:45.397
It's just one day a month.

936
01:00:46.366 --> 01:00:48.526
I would like to take today off.

937
01:00:49.196 --> 01:00:51.167
- What? - Goodbye.

938
01:00:51.736 --> 01:00:53.437
See you tomorrow morning.

939
01:00:58.337 --> 01:01:00.046
Min Deul Rae, how dare you?

940
01:01:01.647 --> 01:01:03.517
Is Dad out?

941
01:01:04.377 --> 01:01:05.676
Well, yes.

942
01:01:05.986 --> 01:01:07.917
He went to play golf early in the morning.

943
01:01:08.747 --> 01:01:11.216
I was hoping to tell you both at the same time.

944
01:01:12.857 --> 01:01:15.227
I will go abroad to study.

945
01:01:18.397 --> 01:01:19.397
Will you?

946
01:01:19.566 --> 01:01:21.327
Tell me when I leave.

947
01:01:22.096 --> 01:01:23.497
I'll be prepared.

948
01:01:26.636 --> 01:01:29.506
Okay. That's my daughter.

949
01:01:34.747 --> 01:01:36.716
(Chairman No Yang Ho)

950
01:01:38.776 --> 01:01:39.787
Hello, sir.

951
01:01:46.457 --> 01:01:48.357
What excuse did you give Myung Hee?

952
01:01:52.596 --> 01:01:54.167
It's my day off.

953
01:01:54.497 --> 01:01:56.437
I dropped by on my way to see my father.

954
01:01:57.636 --> 01:02:00.366
What did Myung Hee tell you to find out?

955
01:02:01.006 --> 01:02:03.736
The last one was where her son is staying.

956
01:02:04.176 --> 01:02:05.776
And did you find out?

957
01:02:05.776 --> 01:02:06.906
Yes.

958
01:02:06.906 --> 01:02:10.116
But there's a middle step that should be mentioned.

959
01:02:14.116 --> 01:02:15.587
A middle step?

960
01:02:19.587 --> 01:02:21.187
January cleaning day.

961
01:02:21.187 --> 01:02:22.357
Clean your room...

962
01:02:22.357 --> 01:02:24.227
and meet in the kitchen at 11am.

963
01:02:31.437 --> 01:02:33.767
Isn't that hard work? Let me do the rest.

964
01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:36.377
No, it's easy to use, so it's not hard at all.

965
01:02:36.537 --> 01:02:38.636
Go help out the kitchen.

966
01:02:40.707 --> 01:02:43.747
Do Kyung's causing a huge mess.

967
01:02:50.716 --> 01:02:52.256
Give me that, I'll do it.

968
01:02:53.486 --> 01:02:55.727
I'll do it. This is my job.

969
01:02:56.256 --> 01:02:58.227
Teaching the rookie how things are done here...

970
01:02:58.227 --> 01:02:59.627
is a part of this house's rule.

971
01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:01.196
Didn't you read the rule book?

972
01:03:09.676 --> 01:03:12.676
Align this to this and slide it in.

973
01:03:13.607 --> 01:03:14.647
You try it.

974
01:03:17.647 --> 01:03:18.647
You did that well.

975
01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:20.747
Once I get how it works.

976
01:03:21.346 --> 01:03:22.756
I lack the experience.

977
01:03:23.457 --> 01:03:24.557
Then get up.

978
01:03:28.787 --> 01:03:32.026
Do you remember where everything has to be?

979
01:03:32.026 --> 01:03:33.366
Is there a set location?

980
01:03:34.066 --> 01:03:36.366
Yes, we all use the fridge together.

981
01:03:36.736 --> 01:03:39.506
We keep our drinks and foods in certain corners.

982
01:03:40.707 --> 01:03:43.506
Did you mix all the foods and ingredients together?

983
01:03:44.006 --> 01:03:45.077
I know your spot.

984
01:03:45.406 --> 01:03:47.776
Your milk, your food, your beer,

985
01:03:47.776 --> 01:03:48.946
and your triangle gimbap.

986
01:03:49.946 --> 01:03:52.077
The gimbap's shelf life had been expired.

987
01:03:58.816 --> 01:04:00.886
The people upstairs use the top two shelves.

988
01:04:01.127 --> 01:04:02.627
The top shelf is for Carpenter Yang.

989
01:04:03.557 --> 01:04:06.296
The rest for Junk Seller and Entertainer.

990
01:04:07.127 --> 01:04:09.696
The lowest two shelves are for us downstairs.

991
01:04:11.337 --> 01:04:14.066
You keep your stuff on the right-hand side.

992
01:04:14.337 --> 01:04:15.566
Mine are next to yours.

993
01:04:16.207 --> 01:04:18.707
Yong Gook and Hyuk keep theirs above that.

994
01:04:22.406 --> 01:04:23.417
You're smart.

995
01:04:27.017 --> 01:04:29.716
I found investors.

996
01:04:31.156 --> 01:04:32.256
Did you really?

997
01:04:33.057 --> 01:04:34.187
Yes.

998
01:04:34.357 --> 01:04:35.386
How...

999
01:04:37.357 --> 01:04:38.357
Good for you.

1000
01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.466
If I start my business...

1001
01:04:42.596 --> 01:04:44.096
- No. - Never mind.

1002
01:04:48.566 --> 01:04:51.537
But I wish you good luck.

1003
01:05:04.616 --> 01:05:07.187
Do Kyung, Ji An, come eat.

1004
01:05:07.557 --> 01:05:08.557
Hyuk.

1005
01:05:08.557 --> 01:05:10.127
Yes. We're done.

1006
01:05:10.696 --> 01:05:13.026
Let's eat now.

1007
01:05:13.397 --> 01:05:14.667
My gosh. Sit over here.

1008
01:05:15.837 --> 01:05:17.997
- Thank you. - It looks good.

1009
01:05:23.477 --> 01:05:25.537
The rags are drying on the roof,

1010
01:05:25.776 --> 01:05:27.607
and I have to go out on business.

01:05:27.977 --> 01:05:29.006
Well done, everyone.

1012
01:05:30.247 --> 01:05:31.377
- You should eat first. - Why...

1013
01:05:31.377 --> 01:05:32.687
You did good work.

1014
01:05:36.857 --> 01:05:38.057
- You praise me too much. - Who is it?

1015
01:05:38.087 --> 01:05:40.227
It's Mr. Kim, the estate agent.

1016
01:05:42.627 --> 01:05:44.057
The estate agent, Mr. Kim, is here.

1017
01:05:44.656 --> 01:05:45.656
What?

1018
01:05:47.596 --> 01:05:48.596
Hello.

1019
01:05:48.596 --> 01:05:49.636
- Welcome. - Thank you.

1020
01:05:49.997 --> 01:05:52.397
Mr. Kim. I didn't expect you. What brings you here?

1021
01:06:10.116 --> 01:06:11.656
So this was where you were.

1022
01:06:12.116 --> 01:06:13.156
Both of you.
