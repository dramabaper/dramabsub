(Episode 25)

2
00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.080
I finally found her.

3
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.669
That's...

4
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
That's...

5
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.580
the necklace I gave to Aji 3.

6
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.449
Let me explain everything.

7
00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.619
Until now,

8
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.000
have you been lying to me?

9
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.080
I feel nauseous.

10
00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.379
Oh, no.

11
00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.000
I'm sorry. I'll explain everything.

12
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.039
Please leave.

13
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.169
Oh, no.

14
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.440
No.

15
00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.190
- Put on the oxygen mask. - Yes, sir.

16
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.490
- Check his pulse. - Yes, sir.

17
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.600
Has his blood vessels expanded?

18
00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.300
- Give him 0.3ml of epinephrine. - Okay.

19
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.170
Give him fluid at full speed.

20
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.230
Yes, sir.

21
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.089
Insomnia.

22
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.990
Generalized seizures.

23
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.430
Hallucinating by mistaking a human being as a robot.

24
00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.629
What do you think psychiatrists call this kind of condition?

25
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.839
They classify it as delirium tremens.

26
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:51.040
They call it a mental illness.

27
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.709
I already got a doctor's confirmation.

28
00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.980
Staying as a director is not the problem.

29
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.750
He'll also get socially ostracized.

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.089
(Kim Min Kyu Hid His Rare Disease and Embezzled a Large Sum of Money)

32
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.199
I'm not willing to go that far...

33
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.370
if you agree to show me some appreciation.

34
00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.940
(Waiver)

35
00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.480
Aji 3 never existed from the start.

36
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.579
You used Jo Ji A, a human being,

37
00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:35.779
to fool Kim Min Kyu into thinking that it's Aji 3.

38
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.019
Send Aji 3 to the designated time and date...

39
00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:40.889
that I'll be notifying you with.

40
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.690
And she'll be gone forever.

41
00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:48.060
We're going to change Aji 3's face.

42
00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:49.908
We'll check her first and change it afterwards.

43
00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:52.078
So don't change a single thing.

44

(Signature: Hong Baek Gyoon)

45
00:09:10.248 --> 00:09:11.919
Are you okay?

46
00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:37.248
Min Kyu!

47
00:10:13.348 --> 00:10:15.348
Min Kyu just woke up.

48
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:20.789
While he was unconscious, his condition kept...

49
00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:24.299
going back and forth for some reason, so I was worried.

50
00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.598
But his condition's become a lot better,

51
00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:29.299
and he's able to talk to people as long as there's no physical contact.

52
00:10:29.868 --> 00:10:32.598
But he still has trouble moving around,

53
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:34.939
and he needs to take some more rest.

54
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.319
(Written Statement)

55
00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:00.258
I brought you a written statement from everyone who was...

56
00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:02.169
involved with the test of Aji 3.

57
00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:06.098
They all wrote down in detail about how their fraudulent test...

58
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.069
all started in the first place.

59
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:10.639
I want you to sue everyone.

60
00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.139
Okay.

61
00:11:13.508 --> 00:11:15.108
But if you sue them,

62
00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:17.478
you might end up getting dismissed from your position.

63
00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:22.218
You should read the summarized report first.

64
00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:24.488
(Incident Report)

65
00:11:33.128 --> 00:11:34.868
A deep learning video clip?

66
00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:37.998
What's this?

67
00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.569
Why is there a video of me?

68
00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:45.309
It appears that...

69
00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:48.179
Aji 3's deep learning process is to...

70
00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:51.078
record a video and extract a set of similar patterns from it.

71
00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:54.248
The process will stay the same even if Aji 3 becomes an actual product.

72
00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:57.419
However, you can sue them for having watched the video...

73
00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.088
without your consent.

74
00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:03.328
Doctor Hong signed a document, stating that everything was a lie...

75
00:12:03.758 --> 00:12:06.899
in return for getting the video clip back from Chairman Hwang.

76
00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:10.669
He also agreed to hand over the real Aji 3 with no strings attached.

77
00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:13.039
Has he gone mad? Why would he sign that?

78
00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:14.569
They threatened him that...

79
00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:18.078
they'll reveal your illness to the press if he didn't.

80
00:12:20.008 --> 00:12:21.049
I see.

81
00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:26.319
So are you saying he did that for me?

82
00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:31.159
Do you expect me to believe that?

83
00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:32.519
It's the truth.

84
00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.128
And if you decide to sue them,

85
00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.728
this test will become public.

86
00:12:36.728 --> 00:12:38.659
And you'll end up getting dismissed...

87
00:12:39.098 --> 00:12:42.699
for the same reason that CEO Hwang got dismissed.

88
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:44.368
I don't care.

89
00:12:44.368 --> 00:12:47.838
I want you to sue the entire Santa Maria Research Team.

90
00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:50.368
I also want you to sue that woman who pretended to be a robot.

91
00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:53.378
Okay, sir.

92
00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:56.478
I'll carry on with the procedure.

93
00:13:03.988 --> 00:13:05.819
(Written Statement)

94
00:13:09.258 --> 00:13:10.529
And this is...

95
00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.358
my letter of resignation.

96
00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:15.598
I'm currently waiting to be assigned for another position in the company.

97
00:13:15.998 --> 00:13:18.838
I wrote in the letter why I decided to quit.

98
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:22.769
I'll fulfill my duties until you hire someone else.

99
00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:51.169
On top of everything that's happened, are you saying...

100
00:13:52.738 --> 00:13:54.809
that woman is your younger sister?

101
00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:56.669
I'm...

102
00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.909
very sorry.

103
00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:03.949
Get lost.

104
00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:08.519
Oh, and tell everyone that...

105
00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:11.919
I want them to leave my house...

106
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:14.258
as soon as possible.

107
00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:16.728
Okay, sir.

108
00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:40.348
Mr. Jo.

109
00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:43.949
Have some warm tea before you go.

110
00:14:57.769 --> 00:15:01.608
The late Chairman Kim Myung Hoon liked this tea very much.

111
00:15:03.338 --> 00:15:05.939
I offered it to Director Kim many times,

112
00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:09.309
but he just doesn't seem to like it.

113
00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:11.248
Thank you.

114
00:15:11.618 --> 00:15:12.649
Please.

115
00:15:20.118 --> 00:15:21.828
You aren't running away, are you?

116
00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:23.488
What?

117
00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:26.799
Long ago, the late chairman...

118
00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:31.069
would say this to me whenever things got a little rough.

119
00:15:31.939 --> 00:15:34.738
"It's wrong to run away when someone's suffering."

120
00:15:39.578 --> 00:15:41.248
I told them not to.

121
00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.748
They wanted to...

122
00:15:44.748 --> 00:15:47.149
tell you the truth, and I stopped them.

123
00:15:48.088 --> 00:15:50.919
For fear that you'd suffer, that you'd die.

124
00:15:52.258 --> 00:15:54.328
That's why they couldn't tell you.

125
00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:56.929
So what?

126
00:15:58.429 --> 00:16:00.598
What does that have to do with me now?

127
00:16:05.622 --> 00:16:10.622
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E25 I'm Not a Robot "Have You Been Lying All Along?"</font>

128
00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:16.848
When...

129
00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:21.248
was that?

130
00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:26.988
The day of the reset.

131
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:29.228
If...

132
00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:32.399
they had told you the truth then,

133
00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:35.628
what do you think would've happened?

134
00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.238
Would've the joy that Aji 3 was human...

135
00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:43.708
outweighed the feeling of betrayal?

136
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:48.449
I'm sleepy. You can go.

137
00:16:49.848 --> 00:16:51.378
I can be alone now.

138
00:16:54.019 --> 00:16:56.149
You must eat before you sleep.

139
00:16:57.248 --> 00:16:58.458
I'm not hungry.

140
00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:01.458
Sleep well.

141
00:17:23.478 --> 00:17:24.548
Does he...

142
00:17:25.548 --> 00:17:26.778
want to see me?

143
00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.288
What happens to us now?

144
00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:35.359
Director Kim...

145
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.998
said the following.

146
00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.399
"Right now,"

147
00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:44.399
"without delaying for one second,"

148
00:17:45.099 --> 00:17:46.399
"get out of my house."

149
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.268
That's it.

150
00:17:53.879 --> 00:17:55.008
That's only natural.

151
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:57.208
Let's pack.

152
00:17:57.849 --> 00:18:00.788
We'll take the machines and computers after we find storage.

153
00:18:01.318 --> 00:18:02.949
What about Aji 3?

154
00:18:04.218 --> 00:18:07.159
We'll take her. To give to Chairman Hwang later.

155
00:18:09.458 --> 00:18:10.558
Where...

156
00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:13.958
do we stay tonight?

157
00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:53.599
- What is it? - Doctor.

158
00:18:54.738 --> 00:18:56.208
What do I do now?

159
00:18:57.339 --> 00:18:58.708
What can I do?

160
00:18:59.708 --> 00:19:02.478
He got better because of me,

161
00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:04.679
but then he got sick again.

162
00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:08.949
I'll do everything you say, anything you want.

163
00:19:09.589 --> 00:19:10.958
What should I do now?

164
00:19:11.758 --> 00:19:13.488
What can I do...

165
00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:16.859
to make him better again?

166
00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:23.968
I have a feeling that the answer lies with you, not me.

167
00:19:25.369 --> 00:19:27.738
You created the miracle.

168
00:19:28.808 --> 00:19:30.879
If you find an answer,

169
00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:33.909
that could just be the correct one.

170
00:19:36.278 --> 00:19:37.949
That's what I think now.

171
00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:11.018
Auntie, come eat.

172
00:20:13.018 --> 00:20:15.149
I don't want to eat.

173
00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:18.318
Sit down.

174
00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:21.629
I really am not hungry.

175
00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:26.028
I cooked for you. Eat at least a spoonful.

176
00:20:26.028 --> 00:20:28.129
Auntie, it's really tasty.

177
00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:29.869
I bet you'll finish it all.

178
00:20:30.068 --> 00:20:32.099
Eat up. You too.

179
00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:33.798
Okay, I'll eat.

180
00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:57.129
Teach me how to cook.

181
00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:01.528
Make them the same size. Gently and slowly.

182
00:21:04.238 --> 00:21:07.538
From the top to the bottom, gently.

183
00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:10.008
Identically.

184
00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:16.109
Slowly.

185
00:21:18.518 --> 00:21:19.879
Oh dear.

186
00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:22.089
Dong Hyun, the first aid kit.

187
00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:23.288
Take this off.

188
00:21:23.988 --> 00:21:25.018
Oh no.

189
00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:26.758
It stings.

190
00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:34.169
Let me. Thank you.

191
00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:36.568
Ssanip.

192
00:21:37.369 --> 00:21:38.399
Thanks.

193
00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:41.468
Do you have a place to stay?

194
00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:46.208
Come here during the day. I have no customers anyway.

195
00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:47.909
Or at night, either.

196
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:49.179
Don't.

197
00:21:49.949 --> 00:21:52.818
We're looking for a studio or a warehouse with an office.

198
00:21:52.818 --> 00:21:56.518
We can't go abroad once we're sued.

199
00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:59.159
You'll be sued? By whom? Kim Min Kyu?

200
00:22:01.329 --> 00:22:03.028
We deserve it.

201
00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:06.258
The deeper the love, the deeper the wound.

202
00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:11.639
I guess Min Kyu liked you people more than I thought.

203
00:22:20.778 --> 00:22:24.548
Do you want someone with this illness for a son-in-law?

204
00:22:26.718 --> 00:22:28.318
Leave the future of KM Financial...

205
00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:30.919
to Yoo Cheol and Ri El,

206
00:22:31.058 --> 00:22:34.958
and you and I can offer those two our support.

207
00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:37.399
Isn't that a beautiful picture?

208
00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:42.028
To do that,

209
00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:45.568
you need someone to own the shares you bought under borrowed names.

210
00:22:45.899 --> 00:22:47.968
I'll transfer them to Ri El.

211
00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:49.568
Once they're married.

212
00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:52.738
What will you do with Min Kyu?

213
00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.679
Now that you and I are working together,

214
00:22:54.849 --> 00:22:57.548
we can get rid of him whenever we need.

215
00:22:57.849 --> 00:23:00.679
Of course, until then, his illness...

216
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:03.018
must be kept between us.

217
00:23:03.889 --> 00:23:05.189
Yoo Cheol and Ri El...

218
00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:08.288
should only see and hear the good news.

219
00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:25.238
Butler Sung?

220
00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.718
I brought some food.

221
00:24:13.189 --> 00:24:15.988
You can't eat what other people cooked.

222
00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:20.599
I cooked this with gloves and a mask on.

223
00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:23.228
I made sure not a single hair got into it.

224
00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:28.008
It's really clean.

225
00:25:41.978 --> 00:25:43.109
Okay.

226
00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:46.978
He's trying to get through.

227
00:25:49.349 --> 00:25:51.689
I should endure it too.

228
00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:04.139
Aren't we going to see a storeroom to move in?

229
00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:07.639
We're at school.

230
00:26:07.808 --> 00:26:09.339
I spoke with the professor.

231
00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:11.839
As long as you agree,

232
00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:14.409
the professor position is still available.

233
00:26:15.308 --> 00:26:16.649
Go see the professor.

234
00:26:16.649 --> 00:26:19.879
I made myself clear that I won't take the job.

235
00:26:19.879 --> 00:26:21.048
Pai.

236
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:23.889
I know it's hard, but accept it.

237
00:26:25.458 --> 00:26:27.389
My career is over now.

238
00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:31.329
Santa Maria Team is finished too.

239
00:26:35.699 --> 00:26:37.268
You're better as a professor.

240
00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:43.208
I'll recommend Hoktal and Ssanip to other positions.

241
00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:47.449
Once I send Aji 3 to Chairman Hwang,

242
00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.018
I'll wrap things up.

243
00:26:51.919 --> 00:26:53.919
We believe you, Dr. Hong.

244
00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:57.288
We have many ideas that we want to develop.

245
00:26:57.758 --> 00:27:00.988
We started from nothing and came this far.

246
00:27:01.189 --> 00:27:03.629
We can try again.

247
00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:08.968
My life was based on the belief that I could never be wrong.

248
00:27:10.369 --> 00:27:11.998
However, that belief is destroyed.

249
00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:16.268
I started thinking that I could be wrong.

250
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:21.179
I'm afraid...

251
00:27:22.609 --> 00:27:24.449
of everything.

252
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:27.589
You improve only if you get over that.

253
00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:30.548
Don't run away.

254
00:27:31.488 --> 00:27:33.419
Can't you just go?

255
00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:35.589
So that I'll feel better?

256
00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:50.629
Shall we go?

257
00:28:51.339 --> 00:28:52.498
Let's go.

258
00:29:56.568 --> 00:29:58.068
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:29:58.068 --> 00:30:00.808
Why do you keep coming back when I completely ignore you?

260
00:30:03.139 --> 00:30:04.179
Right.

261
00:30:05.109 --> 00:30:06.238
The lawsuit?

262
00:30:06.478 --> 00:30:09.508
Do you think this will make me cancel the lawsuit?

263
00:30:10.349 --> 00:30:11.449
It's not that.

264
00:30:11.449 --> 00:30:13.419
Then why do you come here?

265
00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:16.419
You're not a robot, so why would you come here?

266
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:22.929
You don't understand what you did to me, right?

267
00:30:23.659 --> 00:30:24.929
Shall I show you?

268
00:30:39.579 --> 00:30:40.679
What's wrong?

269
00:30:41.978 --> 00:30:44.349
In case it's contagious?

270
00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:46.518
Are you afraid?

271
00:30:46.649 --> 00:30:48.248
It's not that at all.

272
00:30:48.248 --> 00:30:50.349
You weren't afraid when you were a robot.

273
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:51.919
Are you now that you're human?

274
00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:53.988
You know it's not that.

275
00:30:53.988 --> 00:30:55.558
Yes, it is!

276
00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:04.869
This is my response.

277
00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:07.439
Get lost.

278
00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:26.659
I'm sorry.

279
00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:29.089
However,

280
00:31:30.058 --> 00:31:32.359
I'm not scared of you at all.

281
00:31:35.129 --> 00:31:39.068
No matter what you say to me...

282
00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:42.968
or do, I'll be back.

283
00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:46.978
Tomorrow, the day after...

284
00:31:48.808 --> 00:31:51.278
I'll come back to see you every day.

285
00:32:21.203 --> 00:32:24.803
(Episode 26 will air shortly.)
