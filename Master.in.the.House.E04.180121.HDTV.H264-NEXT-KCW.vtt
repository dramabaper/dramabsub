1
00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:07.464
(The day of meeting
the second master)

2
00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:10.635
(Over the mountains
and across the water,)

3
00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.935
(they arrived in Yangsan,
South Gyeongsang Province.)

4
00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.675
(A restaurant...)

5
00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:20.614
(in front of Tongdo Temple?)

6
00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:24.384
(The second master...)

7
00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:26.685
(called them here.)

8
00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:29.985
(The man called the king)

9
00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:31.584
Are they not here yet?

10
00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.695
What's going on?
Is it a prank again?

11
00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:36.564
What's going on?

12
00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:38.394
(Lee Sang Yun, a prank experienced)

13
00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:40.335
I feel scared.

14
00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:44.305
(He's doing the prank himself.)

15
00:00:45.704 --> 00:00:46.805
Hi.

16
00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:48.204
(Se Hyeong who will finish
the prank arrives.)

17
00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:50.674
- A crybaby.
- What?

18
00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:53.144
Are you going to cry again today?

19
00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:54.574
Of course not.

20
00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:58.184
If you're going to cry,
you should be on a different show.

21
00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:01.155
It's okay to cry,
but don't cry on purpose.

22
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:04.555
The staff is startled and confused.

23
00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:05.655
(Crying show, Yuk Seong Jae tears,
Lee Sang Yun sobbing, morning cry)

24
00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:08.525
It's crazy because
you two cried so much.

25
00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.195
- I know you cried so much.
- At least we have a line.

26
00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.835
Crybabies line.

27
00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:17.005
You're no longer Seoul National
University, but Seoul crybaby.

28
00:01:18.264 --> 00:01:20.035
Sobbing major at Seoul crybaby.

29
00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:21.574
Goodness.

30
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.645
It's not easy.

31
00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:26.544
(While Se Hyeong's making fun
of two crybabies...)

32
00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.145
That's not right.
What's wrong with you?

33
00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.544
- I didn't realize.
- How are you?

34
00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:35.984
- It's so far.
- I know.

35
00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:39.195
I thought it's so far, but at least
we're at a restaurant.

36
00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:40.794
- Do we start after eating?
- Did you bring that again?

37
00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:43.925
The master called you here.

38
00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:45.895
- What?
- Us?

39
00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:47.734
Is he a chef here?

40
00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:50.104
He must be the chef.

41
00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:51.305
(Is the master who called them to
the restaurant a chef?)

42
00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:55.374
- There's Tongdo Temple in front.
- Tongdo Temple.

43
00:01:56.904 --> 00:01:59.775
It's 1of 3 temples in Korea.
It's extremely big.

44
00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:02.445
I knew we were going to
Tongdo Temple.

45
00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:03.544
- Why?
- How?

46
00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:06.354
Because he called us to Yangsan.

47
00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:07.785
(If they had to come to Yangsan
so far from Seoul...)

48
00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:09.285
This means...

49
00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:10.725
(He starts his deduction.)

50
00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:13.654
I thought it's something difficult.
Mountains are difficult.

51
00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:16.925
Temples are in the mountains.
There's one...

52
00:02:17.395 --> 00:02:18.694
among 100 people.

53
00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.805
- 100 people?
- 100 people we want to meet...

54
00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:24.735
- the Butler Car.
- Yes.

55
00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:25.805
(One person shines particularly more
in Sang Yun's memory.)

56
00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.705
Are we going to meet a monk?

57
00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:30.805
(Does Sang Yun think he's a monk?)

58
00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:34.615
So I think we extremely...

59
00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:38.385
I have no clue.

60
00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:44.885
- Your deduction was good.
- I thought it was a different show.

61
00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:47.994
If you want to talk alone,
you should be a BJ.

62
00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:49.795
I'll give you 100 balloons.

63
00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:51.194
No.

64
00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:52.934
Can I read this?

65
00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:56.404
- Open it, Seong Jae.
- It's the master's message.

66
00:02:57.335 --> 00:03:00.575
- He wrote it.
- "Eat a lot. It's on me. Master."

67
00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.645
It's because you kept saying you
were hungry on the first episode.

68
00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:06.045
It says eat a lot. Can we order
for more?

69
00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:08.645
This "Eat a lot"...

70
00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:11.284
sounds like he's old.

71
00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:12.684
I think...

72
00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:14.885
he didn't write much.

73
00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:15.885
(Seung Gi thinks
he didn't write much.)

74
00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:17.184
- You're right.
- His writings...

75
00:03:17.184 --> 00:03:19.154
- aren't nice or ugly.
- Right.

76
00:03:19.154 --> 00:03:22.194
- He just didn't write much.
- Or...

77
00:03:23.094 --> 00:03:26.534
(An hour ago)

78
00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:29.205
(This is real.)

79
00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:32.034
(Shaking)

80
00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:36.004
He never wrote much.

81
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:38.575
I can tell he put an effort
to write nicely.

82
00:03:38.874 --> 00:03:41.645
I think he...

83
00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:44.744
lives an orderly life for sure.

84
00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:46.485
Why? Where did you get
the idea from?

85
00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:47.684
This...

86
00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:51.925
The lines are all straight.

87
00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:53.795
It's not messy.

88
00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:56.295
It means he's on schedule.

89
00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:00.464
Since Master In Kwon is
not on schedule...

90
00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:03.635
- His writing's messy...
- He does.

91
00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:05.835
(Neat, messy)

92
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.575
We should eat the one
the master chose.

93
00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:10.545
This must be the master's
favorite restaurant.

94
00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:11.675
He's right.

95
00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:13.474
Maybe he comes here after
going to the temple.

96
00:04:13.474 --> 00:04:16.545
- It's his routine.
- Right.

97
00:04:16.914 --> 00:04:20.115
The master paid already.

98
00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:23.255
- It's acorn muk.
- It's acorn muk.

99
00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:24.554
- Is that pajeon?
- It's a lot.

100
00:04:24.924 --> 00:04:27.325
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

101
00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:30.065
- What's that one?
- That's a lot.

102
00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.395
What a sumptuous feast!

103
00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:34.395
All the food on the menu
are on the table.

104
00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:36.904
Let's just eat.

105
00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:39.904
All sorts of delicacies are here.

106
00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:43.304
There are bossam, grilled mackerel,
and grilled bulgogi...

107
00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:45.315
And pajeon...

108
00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:46.974
Cabbage... it's crazy.

109
00:04:47.044 --> 00:04:49.185
Everything here is my favorite.

110
00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:51.714
I'm really happy,
but I can't readily have the food.

111
00:04:51.714 --> 00:04:53.015
I feel so uncomfortable.

112
00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:56.255
(There are a lot of food, but...)

113
00:04:56.854 --> 00:04:57.924
I'm hungry.

114
00:04:59.054 --> 00:05:00.325
(They feel uncomfortable
with such hospitality.)

115
00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:03.065
In variety shows, something is wrong
to have such hospitality.

116
00:05:03.065 --> 00:05:04.825
Oh well...

117
00:05:06.794 --> 00:05:08.364
We'll start eating then.

118
00:05:08.364 --> 00:05:10.664
- Thank you for the food.
- Help yourself.

119
00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:12.935
In this kind of situation,
we just need to enjoy the food.

120
00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:15.145
Steamed eggs were our master's
favorite food.

121
00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:17.544
(I'll feel the master with food.)

122
00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:18.815
Wow, this...

123
00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:20.275
- I don't know what to eat first.
- My goodness.

124
00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:21.515
This doenjang stew is excellent.

125
00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:23.114
This is just for rice.

126
00:05:23.414 --> 00:05:24.614
It's really tasty.

127
00:05:25.255 --> 00:05:27.784
- It's so...
- I feel happy.

128
00:05:28.154 --> 00:05:30.054
- We need to eat a lot.
- It's really good.

129
00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:32.054
(More they eat...)

130
00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:34.195
This pajeon is so delicious.

131
00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:37.825
The master had his meal
here just before.

132
00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:38.895
Really?

133
00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:40.495
Is there a surprise camera
or something here?

134
00:05:42.265 --> 00:05:43.404
This is incredible.

135
00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:45.135
- There is no bowl of rice here.
- Yes.

136
00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:47.904
That's the first hint
about the master.

137
00:05:48.904 --> 00:05:50.844
Dolsot...
Aren't they dolsot rice?

138
00:05:51.044 --> 00:05:53.044
Perhaps on the rice,
the name is written with beans.

139
00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:54.815
Is there something on the lid?

140
00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.085
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.

141
00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:00.015
Let's open it.
1, 2, 3.

142
00:06:01.724 --> 00:06:03.154
- There is only rice.
- A half bowl of rice?

143
00:06:03.854 --> 00:06:05.794
(First hint)

144
00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:08.765
(A half bowl of rice)

145
00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:11.594
What's going on?

146
00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:13.265
What's this?

147
00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:15.565
(A half bowl of rice?)

148
00:06:15.565 --> 00:06:17.034
Is this... Is this a hint?

149
00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:18.164
- A half size?
- Yes.

150
00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:22.304
We heard the master used to
have a half bowl of rice here.

151
00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:24.775
Why? There are so many food here.

152
00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:27.515
Perhaps he eats all the food
here on the table.

153
00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:30.185
He eats all the dishes
with only a half bowl of rice.

154
00:06:30.344 --> 00:06:32.914
- That's right.
- Is his last name Ban?

155
00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:35.625
- Ban?
- That makes sense.

156
00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:36.685
Ban?

157
00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:38.495
Whose last name is Ban?

158
00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:40.895
No way.

159
00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:42.895
I don't think it's Ban Ki Moon.

160
00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:45.025
Do you think he eats this much?

161
00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:47.094
I guess he might eat like a bird.

162
00:06:47.435 --> 00:06:49.304
Sang Yun, are you really here
to eat?

163
00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.065
(Sang Yun, are you really here
to eat?)

164
00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:53.904
We're in front of cameras.
I thought you were a guest here.

165
00:06:53.904 --> 00:06:55.145
It's not like that.

166
00:06:55.145 --> 00:06:58.575
He wants to speak,
but he was told to help himself.

167
00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:00.974
So, he's really helping himself.

168
00:07:01.474 --> 00:07:02.685
"Help yourself."

169
00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:05.214
- I'll help myself.
- He's the one...

170
00:07:05.214 --> 00:07:06.955
who faithfully
does as he was taught.

171
00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:08.315
(I'm doing just as what
the master said.)

172
00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:11.255
- I'll enjoy the food.
- I think we need to eat first.

173
00:07:11.554 --> 00:07:13.924
(Just like crying Sang Yun,
crying Seong Jae is eating.)

174
00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:16.094
The vegetables are so sweet.

175
00:07:16.794 --> 00:07:19.794
(They soon concentrate on
eating the food.)

176
00:07:20.664 --> 00:07:22.234
Why does he eat
only a half bowl of rice?

177
00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:26.534
We're already done
talking about it.

178
00:07:28.674 --> 00:07:30.705
The talk is over.

179
00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:32.245
I was just...

180
00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:35.015
- We were wrapping it up.
- Do you want us to follow you?

181
00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:36.445
- We talked about it earlier.
- We can still talk about it, but...

182
00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:37.614
It just came up.

183
00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:40.484
- I was just talking to myself.
- The talk about the rice is over.

184
00:07:44.354 --> 00:07:45.695
It suddenly popped up in my mind.

185
00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:47.895
The second hint about the master...

186
00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:49.065
Please give us the hint.

187
00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:50.625
- That's the one.
- I see.

188
00:07:52.034 --> 00:07:53.835
(What is it?)

189
00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:57.664
It's his schedule.
That's his schedule.

190
00:07:57.664 --> 00:08:00.304
(Second hint,
the master's daily schedule)

191
00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:03.705
Wait, as soon as I saw it,
there was manual labor written.

192
00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:04.875
Is this real?

193
00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:06.815
When we do manual labor,
we can eat like this.

194
00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:11.214
There's another manual labor
with high intensity from 7pm to 9pm.

195
00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:13.755
Wait.

196
00:08:14.114 --> 00:08:16.685
People usually don't do labors
when they had one in the morning.

197
00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.495
What is escaping?

198
00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:20.154
Wait a minute. Look here.

199
00:08:20.895 --> 00:08:21.995
Look through the schedule carefully.

200
00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:23.164
A fight with Chul Soo?

201
00:08:23.164 --> 00:08:24.924
- What's this?
- First...

202
00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:26.734
We need to get up at 7am.

203
00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:29.104
I'm not sure if
this will really happen.

204
00:08:30.464 --> 00:08:31.565
And after that...

205
00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:34.104
from 9am to 12pm,
there's escaping.

206
00:08:34.104 --> 00:08:35.745
He potters around alone.

207
00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:37.444
What is escaping?

208
00:08:37.904 --> 00:08:40.674
What's this? It's said
pottering around while escaping.

209
00:08:40.674 --> 00:08:42.245
He basically fiddles around.

210
00:08:42.985 --> 00:08:45.284
- That's right. I like it.
- He just potters.

211
00:08:45.715 --> 00:08:47.314
(The next master is my type.)

212
00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:49.025
What's the race against time?

213
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.794
I think he needs to do something
within 2 hours.

214
00:08:52.895 --> 00:08:54.794
But isn't it too difficult
to do things withing 2 hours?

215
00:08:55.294 --> 00:08:57.265
Marathon? Marathon? Marathon!

216
00:08:57.465 --> 00:08:59.064
Marathon?

217
00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:01.965
Perhaps he's a marathon runner?

218
00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:04.564
Perhaps it's a way of training.

219
00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:06.904
- There's a high possibility of it.
- Right.

220
00:09:06.904 --> 00:09:08.745
What's is the fight with Chul Soo?

221
00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:10.645
Is it like coming back
from the turning point?

222
00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:12.775
There must be...

223
00:09:13.944 --> 00:09:17.084
a location called Chul Soo,
which he named it.

224
00:09:18.215 --> 00:09:21.015
I'm so sorry.

225
00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:23.485
I can't guess what Chul Soo is.

226
00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:26.454
(Sang Yun gave up with
guessing what Chul Soo is.)

227
00:09:26.454 --> 00:09:28.995
He has lunch until 2pm,
and has dinner at 6pm.

228
00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:30.064
You're right.

229
00:09:30.064 --> 00:09:32.694
I think the most severe thing
must be the fight with Chul Soo.

230
00:09:33.534 --> 00:09:37.934
(Chul Soo...
We want to know about Chul Soo.)

231
00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:40.334
There are only fights.

232
00:09:40.574 --> 00:09:42.544
I think he could be...

233
00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:44.975
a well-known thug
who is legendary.

234
00:09:47.444 --> 00:09:50.044
It's kind of sad.

235
00:09:52.515 --> 00:09:53.954
Why?

236
00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:55.924
He potters around alone.

237
00:09:55.924 --> 00:09:58.355
(He potters around alone.)

238
00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:00.294
Are you ready to cry again?

239
00:10:00.395 --> 00:10:02.725
It's too early to cry.

240
00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:04.324
It's only 10:45am.

241
00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:05.895
Seong Jae, stop crying.

242
00:10:07.164 --> 00:10:08.635
Here's the address
where the master lives.

243
00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:10.505
(Before he cries,
where the master lives is revealed.)

244
00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:12.605
- The address?
- Where he lives...

245
00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:15.775
- Wait.
- What?

246
00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:17.005
Baegunam?

247
00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:19.475
- What is Baegunam?
- What's this?

248
00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:20.775
It's a small temple.

249
00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:22.245
- A small temple?
- A small temple.

250
00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:24.044
It's said it's a small temple
around Tongdo Temple.

251
00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:28.985
So is he pottering around alone
at Baegunam?

252
00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:31.385
It'll be very cold.

253
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:32.895
(Who can be at Baegunam alone?)

254
00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:34.525
Please go ahead.

255
00:10:34.755 --> 00:10:36.725
(Escaping, pottering alone)

256
00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:37.895
Let's go.

257
00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:40.434
This is awesome.

258
00:10:40.434 --> 00:10:44.005
(Where there's no fine dust
with clear environment)

259
00:10:45.304 --> 00:10:46.534
We're going.

260
00:10:47.074 --> 00:10:49.105
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

261
00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:52.875
Are we going there?

262
00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:53.975
Where?

263
00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:55.885
Over there.
The rock on the mountain...

264
00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:59.454
(Is Baegunam the rock
on the top of the mountain?)

265
00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:01.725
Among all mountains,

266
00:11:02.054 --> 00:11:04.525
the mountains with word "rock"
in the name are very rugged.

267
00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:05.725
Se Hyeong,

268
00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:07.895
I hiked Mount Worak
during the long distance marching.

269
00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:09.765
Mount Worak?

270
00:11:10.694 --> 00:11:12.064
The name of the mountain
contains word "rock" too.

271
00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:13.664
Also, it means the mountain
is too rugged to make you shriek.

272
00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:15.064
That's right.
It's rugged to make you shriek.

273
00:11:15.064 --> 00:11:16.605
You're right.

274
00:11:16.605 --> 00:11:18.005
The mountain was very rocky.

275
00:11:18.164 --> 00:11:20.204
With no exaggeration,
the mountain was steep like this.

276
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:21.775
And you had to go down like this.

277
00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:23.674
(No interests)

278
00:11:27.044 --> 00:11:29.345
Se Hyeong, I think I should wait
for three months.

279
00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:32.715
- It's okay.
- I think I need a time for myself.

280
00:11:33.414 --> 00:11:35.924
When your story gets longer,
I'll ruthlessly ignore it.

281
00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:37.424
- The story about the military?
- Yes.

282
00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:39.595
I didn't even notice
I was talking about it.

283
00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:41.495
(Another ego that came out
unconsciously)

284
00:11:41.495 --> 00:11:43.525
You're still stuck in there,

285
00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:45.395
the shadow of the military service.

286
00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:48.095
Why is it so hard
to become a civilian?

287
00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:49.434
It's hard.

288
00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:51.235
(Please wait for me for 3 months.)

289
00:11:52.404 --> 00:11:53.975
We're climbing up endlessly.

290
00:11:53.975 --> 00:11:56.044
(A dense pine tree forest appeared
in no time.)

291
00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:59.775
(Because of the narrow road,
they took another car.)

292
00:12:00.015 --> 00:12:01.885
- Look at this place.
- There are lots of pine trees.

293
00:12:01.885 --> 00:12:03.044
- Look at this place.
- It's so pretty.

294
00:12:03.414 --> 00:12:05.454
It's really pretty.

295
00:12:05.654 --> 00:12:07.814
Wow, I've never seen
such many pine trees before.

296
00:12:07.814 --> 00:12:10.885
(The landscape that brings
the youth unquestioned feelings)

297
00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:12.654
You know the ents, the monsters...

298
00:12:12.794 --> 00:12:14.255
They look like fried ramyeon to me.

299
00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:16.794
(In the unquestioned feelings,
they add more imagination.)

300
00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:19.064
There are so many trees.

301
00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:20.664
It's so pretty.

302
00:12:20.664 --> 00:12:23.664
- The air is very fresh too.
- There are so many pine trees here.

303
00:12:24.904 --> 00:12:26.304
This is incredible.

304
00:12:27.975 --> 00:12:29.475
I wonder who the master is...

305
00:12:31.074 --> 00:12:32.745
to ask us to come to
a place like this.

306
00:12:35.115 --> 00:12:36.544
I'm curious.

307
00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:40.914
Sang Yun, are you shooting
yourself alone?

308
00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:43.625
(I should record such great things.)

309
00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.554
His words sounded like a spell.

310
00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:50.164
(As they came up in a muddle
because of the landscape...)

311
00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:51.664
It's the Baegunam parking lot.

312
00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.164
Wait a minute.

313
00:12:55.365 --> 00:12:57.265
We can't go up with the car.

314
00:12:58.334 --> 00:12:59.704
What?

315
00:12:59.704 --> 00:13:01.275
I'm wearing basketball shoes.

316
00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:04.074
We can't go up to Baegunam
with this car.

317
00:13:04.605 --> 00:13:05.914
We can't go up with the car.

318
00:13:05.914 --> 00:13:06.975
(Master... Why are you...)

319
00:13:07.574 --> 00:13:08.845
I can't see the temple from here.

320
00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:11.215
I guess we have to climb up
quite a while.

321
00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:12.885
(To Baegunam, where the master
stays, they have to go on foot.)

322
00:13:15.054 --> 00:13:16.255
We're doomed.

323
00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:20.025
(Is the second master...)

324
00:13:20.025 --> 00:13:22.525
Is he staying in the mountain?

325
00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:23.924
No way.

326
00:13:24.194 --> 00:13:25.664
- Do you have sports shoes?
- Yes.

327
00:13:25.934 --> 00:13:27.095
Good for you.

328
00:13:27.095 --> 00:13:28.934
(They change their dressy shoes
to comfortable ones.)

329
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.105
What a relief.

330
00:13:30.105 --> 00:13:32.635
Hiking is like mental training.
I can just wear any kinds of shoes.

331
00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:34.105
(Hiking is like mental training.
I can just wear any kinds of shoes.)

332
00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.345
Seong Jae, I'll show you
how to hike.

333
00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:41.444
"Am Un Baek Sa Chook Young"

334
00:13:41.615 --> 00:13:43.444
(Am Un Baek Sa Chook Young)

335
00:13:43.444 --> 00:13:45.554
Hey, it's Mount Yeongchuk,
Baegunam.

336
00:13:45.554 --> 00:13:47.184
- You should read in reverse.
- Oh, is it?

337
00:13:47.184 --> 00:13:48.654
(Young Chook San Bake Un Am)

338
00:13:48.654 --> 00:13:49.954
Should I read it in reverse?

339
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.824
I don't know.
That's just how you read.

340
00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:53.225
Let's go.

341
00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:55.725
I feel like I'm in
"Law of the Jungle".

342
00:13:55.725 --> 00:13:58.635
(Still at this time,)

343
00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:00.735
(they were laughing.)

344
00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:02.934
Just a second.
We're moving ahead of you.

345
00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:04.704
Let us move ahead of you.

346
00:14:04.704 --> 00:14:05.875
(The staff tries to move ahead
of them to shoot them.)

347
00:14:06.235 --> 00:14:07.605
We're moving ahead of you.

348
00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:10.044
Run fast.
Run so that they can't catch us.

349
00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:12.914
(Suddenly, the members are
showing their heels.)

350
00:14:12.914 --> 00:14:14.475
Fast. Run fast.

351
00:14:15.215 --> 00:14:16.845
Fast. Run fast.

352
00:14:18.084 --> 00:14:19.615
They're running away.

353
00:14:19.885 --> 00:14:21.385
Stop there!

354
00:14:21.385 --> 00:14:22.824
(Suddenly a race began
without a reason.)

355
00:14:22.824 --> 00:14:24.025
Come and catch us.

356
00:14:24.025 --> 00:14:25.725
(The staff versus Members)

357
00:14:25.725 --> 00:14:28.595
(Passionate Seung Gi
is leading them.)

358
00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:31.095
- Seung Gi is fast.
- Seung Gi is really fast.

359
00:14:34.095 --> 00:14:36.204
(He strangely becomes enthusiastic.)

360
00:14:36.204 --> 00:14:37.534
I will shoot it.

361
00:14:39.934 --> 00:14:41.875
(Giggling)

362
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:45.515
(Why is he doing this?)

363
00:14:46.715 --> 00:14:48.215
(He's overflowing with energy.)

364
00:14:49.084 --> 00:14:51.544
(Se Hyeong's camera)

365
00:14:51.544 --> 00:14:53.255
Seung Gi is mad.

366
00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:57.084
I think they're underestimating us.

367
00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:58.595
(This is nothing compared
to a long-distance march.)

368
00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:00.654
What's wrong with Seung Gi?

369
00:15:02.064 --> 00:15:04.194
(His mic came off
while he was running.)

370
00:15:06.194 --> 00:15:07.265
Let's go.

371
00:15:07.895 --> 00:15:09.635
There are no stairs now.

372
00:15:10.334 --> 00:15:11.904
- Yes.
- It's completely unpaved.

373
00:15:12.334 --> 00:15:15.074
So this is how he spends
his free time, right?

374
00:15:15.074 --> 00:15:16.944
I think he likes hiking.

375
00:15:17.544 --> 00:15:18.814
(They're healing through hiking.)

376
00:15:18.814 --> 00:15:21.044
Our lifestyles are similar
when it comes to this.

377
00:15:21.044 --> 00:15:22.544
- I love this.
- I love it too.

378
00:15:22.544 --> 00:15:24.385
- I...
- I love working out.

379
00:15:24.385 --> 00:15:25.914
I am the opposite.

380
00:15:26.184 --> 00:15:27.684
- Do you not like it?
- I...

381
00:15:27.684 --> 00:15:29.424
prefer sea to mountain.

382
00:15:30.385 --> 00:15:33.194
I like static sports.

383
00:15:33.395 --> 00:15:34.424
What's this?

384
00:15:34.424 --> 00:15:35.495
(Seong Jae finds something.)

385
00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:36.525
What's that?

386
00:15:36.765 --> 00:15:39.235
- It says "Master in the House".
- it does.

387
00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:40.294
(There's a paper hanging.)

388
00:15:42.404 --> 00:15:44.365
Put arms around
each other's shoulders.

389
00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:46.975
As you sit down, say "Master."

390
00:15:47.174 --> 00:15:49.245
As you get up, say "I love you."

391
00:15:49.975 --> 00:15:51.845
"To celebrate 2018,"

392
00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:55.245
- "Do it 18 times."
- "do it 18 times."

393
00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:56.414
Right now?

394
00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:57.584
(What is this?)

395
00:15:57.715 --> 00:15:59.115
- What's this?
- This...

396
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:01.784
We haven't even met him.

397
00:16:01.784 --> 00:16:03.324
Why would he tell us to do this?

398
00:16:03.654 --> 00:16:05.525
Should we pretend that we did it?

399
00:16:05.725 --> 00:16:07.595
- Who said that?
- Me.

400
00:16:07.725 --> 00:16:09.694
- I think that's really bad.
- Why?

401
00:16:09.694 --> 00:16:11.595
Do this 18 times.

402
00:16:11.834 --> 00:16:13.164
(Is he already
at the rebelling stage?)

403
00:16:13.164 --> 00:16:14.865
Master in the House.
Master in the House.

404
00:16:16.265 --> 00:16:18.334
He won't be watching us
carry out the mission, will he?

405
00:16:18.475 --> 00:16:20.404
He's not on top of the trees,
is he?

406
00:16:21.034 --> 00:16:22.745
(The master's eyes are everywhere.)

407
00:16:22.745 --> 00:16:23.845
Let's try it.

408
00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:25.314
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

409
00:16:26.544 --> 00:16:28.275
The one of the far left
have to do this.

410
00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:30.584
The ones on the two sides
have to do this.

411
00:16:30.584 --> 00:16:33.515
You have to put your hand
behind your head.

412
00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:35.525
Come on.

413
00:16:35.525 --> 00:16:36.584
(He can't take Seung Gi's
army jokes anymore.)

414
00:16:38.355 --> 00:16:39.895
(I will give him what he wants.)

415
00:16:40.225 --> 00:16:41.324
You need to do this.

416
00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:43.895
- Like this?
- Yes.

417
00:16:43.895 --> 00:16:45.064
- Is this how you do it?
- It's perfect.

418
00:16:45.064 --> 00:16:47.334
- Here we go.
- Start.

419
00:16:47.334 --> 00:16:48.434
- Master.
- Master.

420
00:16:48.434 --> 00:16:49.635
No. That's what we say
when we get up.

421
00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:51.135
We have to say "Master"
as we sit down.

422
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.135
"Master" as we sit down,
and "I love you" as we get up.

423
00:16:53.135 --> 00:16:54.605
1 move for every 2 shouts.

424
00:16:54.605 --> 00:16:56.904
(It's a military terminology.)

425
00:16:56.904 --> 00:16:58.074
My gosh.

426
00:16:59.145 --> 00:17:00.245
All right.

427
00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:01.375
Let's stop the shoot.
I won't do it.

428
00:17:03.284 --> 00:17:05.715
Why don't you dig a hole
and sleep there?

429
00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:07.385
- Just sleep in the hole.
- I am sorry.

430
00:17:07.654 --> 00:17:09.985
Just give me three months.

431
00:17:09.985 --> 00:17:11.525
- Three months.
- I will change within February.

432
00:17:11.525 --> 00:17:12.624
(He needs 100 days to adjust.)

433
00:17:12.624 --> 00:17:13.725
- All right.
- Let's do this.

434
00:17:14.624 --> 00:17:16.294
(I am going to keep
an eye on him.)

435
00:17:16.294 --> 00:17:17.425
Let's begin.

436
00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:19.435
- Master, I love you.
- Master, I love you.

437
00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:21.534
- Master, I love you.
- Master, I love you. Two!

438
00:17:21.534 --> 00:17:23.505
- Master, I love you.
- Master, I love you.

439
00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:25.034
- Master, I love you.
- Master, I love you.

440
00:17:25.034 --> 00:17:26.905
(Who is to order us to do this?)

441
00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:28.505
- Master, I love you.
- Master, I love you.

442
00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:35.215
- Master, I love you.
- Master, I love you.

443
00:17:35.215 --> 00:17:37.084
- Master, I love you.
- Master, I love you.

444
00:17:37.185 --> 00:17:38.284
Okay.

445
00:17:38.814 --> 00:17:39.985
Towards the end,

446
00:17:40.155 --> 00:17:42.324
I said, "Master, are you a human?"

447
00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:44.725
I said, "Master, are you a human?"

448
00:17:44.925 --> 00:17:46.225
- I am sweating.
- That's it, right?

449
00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:49.165
- Okay.
- Since we did it,

450
00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:51.025
let's say I never said
we should pretend it.

451
00:17:51.594 --> 00:17:53.034
All right.

452
00:17:53.195 --> 00:17:54.695
You're very thorough.

453
00:17:55.165 --> 00:17:57.564
Where does he live?
Does he live in a cave?

454
00:17:57.564 --> 00:17:58.634
(Their legs have gone weak.)

455
00:17:59.304 --> 00:18:00.534
My goodness.

456
00:18:01.034 --> 00:18:02.104
Where is it?

457
00:18:02.245 --> 00:18:04.945
(But the real hiking just began.)

458
00:18:07.574 --> 00:18:09.584
They won't tell us
how far the summit is.

459
00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:11.915
My gosh.

460
00:18:11.915 --> 00:18:12.915
(They've been hiking
for 30 minutes.)

461
00:18:12.915 --> 00:18:14.455
We are getting quieter.

462
00:18:17.324 --> 00:18:19.495
(They've been hiking
for 45 minutes.)

463
00:18:22.995 --> 00:18:25.265
(They've been hiking
for 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

464
00:18:26.364 --> 00:18:27.634
(They breathe heavily.)

465
00:18:27.634 --> 00:18:29.665
Be careful. Are you all right?

466
00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:31.134
My legs hurt.

467
00:18:31.134 --> 00:18:32.235
Have you given up?

468
00:18:32.935 --> 00:18:35.304
- Are you getting left behind?
- No, I am going to catch up later.

469
00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.374
You're in our way.
Let's move.

470
00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:44.544
(Sang Yun's camera)

471
00:18:44.544 --> 00:18:46.485
The writer has collapsed.

472
00:18:47.354 --> 00:18:49.755
Where on earth are we going?

473
00:18:52.094 --> 00:18:55.324
I think I made a wrong guess
about the master.

474
00:18:55.324 --> 00:18:57.894
(Seong Jae's camera)

475
00:18:57.894 --> 00:19:01.705
I thought he was someone
who enjoys free time.

476
00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:04.235
But he's a mountain...

477
00:19:04.864 --> 00:19:06.275
Gosh, I am dripping saliva.

478
00:19:08.544 --> 00:19:11.005
(Why is he making us suffer
on the first day?)

479
00:19:12.644 --> 00:19:13.715
Let's go.

480
00:19:14.844 --> 00:19:17.415
The time is 1:10pm.

481
00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:19.584
We can catch the 2:30pm train.

482
00:19:20.314 --> 00:19:21.455
- If we go down?
- Yes.

483
00:19:21.854 --> 00:19:22.925
We can hurry up.

484
00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:24.084
(I want to run away.)

485
00:19:24.985 --> 00:19:27.255
Let's go to Master In Kwon's
and get some honey powder.

486
00:19:28.864 --> 00:19:30.725
Let's just have two tablespoons each
and clap.

487
00:19:30.725 --> 00:19:31.834
(Our first master was
a good person.)

488
00:19:31.834 --> 00:19:32.935
- Honey powder.
- And...

489
00:19:32.935 --> 00:19:34.765
we will cry while
listening to "Please".

490
00:19:36.864 --> 00:19:38.574
What will we do
when we meet him?

491
00:19:38.975 --> 00:19:40.034
I'm going to grab his collars.

492
00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:44.905
(He's determined
to take his revenge.)

493
00:19:44.905 --> 00:19:46.044
We've come far.

494
00:19:46.215 --> 00:19:48.884
- We've come really far.
- We have.

495
00:19:48.884 --> 00:19:49.945
(Who are you, master?)

496
00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:52.814
Baby shark

497
00:19:52.814 --> 00:19:56.054
Daddy shark

498
00:19:57.884 --> 00:20:00.354
What can possibly...
I see something.

499
00:20:00.624 --> 00:20:03.624
- I see something.
- I see a Buddhist temple.

500
00:20:04.564 --> 00:20:05.665
That one?

501
00:20:08.134 --> 00:20:09.905
(After a tough hike,)

502
00:20:09.905 --> 00:20:11.634
(they finally see the end.)

503
00:20:13.435 --> 00:20:16.104
(The master is...)

504
00:20:16.104 --> 00:20:17.475
(in the Baegunam!)

505
00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:18.945
Let's call the master.

506
00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:20.775
1, 2, 3.

507
00:20:20.775 --> 00:20:22.215
- Master!
- Master!

508
00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:25.655
Hurry up!

509
00:20:27.215 --> 00:20:29.955
(He shouts loudly.)

510
00:20:31.824 --> 00:20:33.025
(The first clue is
that he's got a loud voice.)

511
00:20:33.025 --> 00:20:35.265
- He sounds very young.
- He does.

512
00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:37.195
- Is he in his late 20s?
- No. No.

513
00:20:37.394 --> 00:20:38.465
I think he's a little older.

514
00:20:38.465 --> 00:20:40.134
- He's in his 40s.
- I don't recognize the voice.

515
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.265
- I know.
- There he is.

516
00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:44.705
(I waited long.)

517
00:20:45.235 --> 00:20:48.175
When he says "Hurry up",
should we say "You come here"?

518
00:20:49.074 --> 00:20:50.874
Do you want to try it?
Who wants to try it?

519
00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:51.874
(He becomes naughty.)

520
00:20:52.114 --> 00:20:54.544
Let's say, "You come here, master."

521
00:20:54.544 --> 00:20:55.884
(They will ask the master
to come to them.)

522
00:20:57.544 --> 00:20:59.015
1, 2.

523
00:20:59.015 --> 00:21:00.515
- Master.
- Master.

524
00:21:01.614 --> 00:21:03.354
Hurry up!

525
00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:05.755
You come here, master.

526
00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:08.354
You come here, master.

527
00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:15.505
I am sorry.

528
00:21:16.334 --> 00:21:17.364
I am sorry.

529
00:21:18.374 --> 00:21:19.874
Let's go. Let's go.

530
00:21:20.104 --> 00:21:21.745
Why did we do it?

531
00:21:22.975 --> 00:21:24.074
(Let's hurry,)

532
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.874
(before he gets more upset.)

533
00:21:27.415 --> 00:21:29.144
He sounds like he's a good fighter.

534
00:21:29.814 --> 00:21:31.314
So I am going to keep quiet.

535
00:21:32.354 --> 00:21:33.715
(He's waiting for them.)

536
00:21:35.884 --> 00:21:37.084
We're here.

537
00:21:37.084 --> 00:21:38.554
(After the 2-hour hike, they arrive
at the gate of the temple.)

538
00:21:38.655 --> 00:21:40.794
Let's call the master. 1, 2, 3.

539
00:21:40.794 --> 00:21:42.225
- Master.
- Master.

540
00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:44.265
Hurry up.

541
00:21:44.864 --> 00:21:46.265
He's near.

542
00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:47.465
- He's here.
- Where are you?

543
00:21:48.195 --> 00:21:49.364
(Who is the master...)

544
00:21:49.364 --> 00:21:52.275
(that made them hike?)

545
00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:53.374
Who is he?

546
00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:54.804
- Who are you?
- He must be the one.

547
00:21:55.144 --> 00:21:56.804
- He must be the one.
- Who?

548
00:21:56.804 --> 00:21:58.574
- I think it's him.
- Who?

549
00:21:58.574 --> 00:22:00.215
He's a big man.

550
00:22:04.284 --> 00:22:07.685
(130 kg Big Master)

551
00:22:07.709 --> 00:22:10.209
(2nd part will begin shortly)

552
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.999
Who is he?

553
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.429
- Who are you?
- He must be the one.

554
00:22:13.769 --> 00:22:15.429
- He must be the one.
- Who?

555
00:22:15.429 --> 00:22:17.199
- I think it's him.
- Who?

556
00:22:17.199 --> 00:22:18.840
He's a big man.

557
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:24.140
(A huge shadow...)

558
00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.310
(is cast in front of the gate.)

559
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.479
(Second clue is
that he's a big man.)

560
00:22:27.509 --> 00:22:29.249
(Is he an athlete?)

561
00:22:29.509 --> 00:22:32.080
- He's a big man.
- Isn't he Defconn?

562
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:33.719
I don't think so.

563
00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:36.050
- He is...
- He's very young.

564
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.360
He looks like Defconn.

565
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.790
Are you Defconn?

566
00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:41.330
Isn't he Defconn?

567
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.489
(They carefully walk towards him.)

568
00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:43.590
Is he really?

569
00:22:45.759 --> 00:22:47.830
- We can't grab his collars.
- He's actually big.

570
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.999
He's got a big bottom.

571
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.370
(Big)

572
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.370
(He's not an ordinary man.)

573
00:22:55.739 --> 00:22:57.409
(Who...)

574
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:58.580
(is he?)

575
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.650
No way!

576
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.850
(They are surprised.)

577
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:03.949
- No way!
- No way!

578
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.019
(It's Lee Dae Ho,
the man who's called a king.)

579
00:23:08.949 --> 00:23:11.860
(He's the highest-paid player
of KBO League.)

580
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:13.929
(He won the Triple Crown 2 times.)

581
00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.729
(And he's the only one
who has that record.)

582
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.400
(Korea, USA, and Japan)

583
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.370
(He swept all 3 countries.)

584
00:23:21.469 --> 00:23:24.540
(He got a world record for hitting
9 home runs in a row.)

585
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.640
(And...)

586
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.780
(he will forever be the quiet
fourth batter of Korea.)

587
00:23:32.439 --> 00:23:33.439
(They will experience...)

588
00:23:33.439 --> 00:23:36.449
(the lifestyle of the king.)

589
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.749
(Things are no different at home.)

590
00:23:39.749 --> 00:23:40.749
(Endure the master's...)

591
00:23:40.749 --> 00:23:42.550
(weight of life.)

592
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.259
- We can play with him.
- Se Hyeong.

593
00:23:44.259 --> 00:23:45.919
- It's you, isn't it?
- It's not me.

594
00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:49.090
(They will experience
the torturing life of the king.)

595
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.130
- No way!
- No way!

596
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.769
(The members are thrilled.)

597
00:23:53.769 --> 00:23:55.900
(But he doesn't look happy.)

598
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:59.540
Hello.

599
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.640
(They remember what
they did to him.)

600
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:05.110
(You come here, Master.)

601
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.449
(I don't want to see him.)

602
00:24:07.449 --> 00:24:08.650
(I would grab his collars.)

603
00:24:09.209 --> 00:24:10.449
(I'm a dead man.)

604
00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:15.550
(They regret their sins.)

605
00:24:17.159 --> 00:24:19.519
(I won't like the master.)

606
00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:21.360
(I won't be able
to greet him nicely.)

607
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.090
(Who are you?)

608
00:24:25.199 --> 00:24:26.999
(It's me, Dae Ho.)

609
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.370
(We shouldn't have been rude.)

610
00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.669
(They regret their past actions.)

611
00:24:34.969 --> 00:24:40.239
- Who said, "You come here"?
- It was him.

612
00:24:40.239 --> 00:24:41.610
- It was him.
- No.

613
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.249
- It was him.
- It was him.

614
00:24:43.249 --> 00:24:45.719
- It was him.
- Let's go up to the summit.

615
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.189
Let's not.

616
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.090
- I made a mistake.
- We would die if we fight with him.

617
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.489
- We're dead men.
- We will die if we fight him.

618
00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:56.330
- Wait. Let's...
- What are we doing?

619
00:24:56.659 --> 00:24:58.630
- Let's go inside first.
- Let's go inside.

620
00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:01.199
- All right.
- He's Yuk Seong Jae.

621
00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:03.130
This is a nice place.

622
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:08.310
This is where I had
my first hard training.

623
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.540
- You trained here.
- I trained here.

624
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.380
That's why I made you come here.
I wanted to show you what I did.

625
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.380
(He wanted to meet them
at the place meaningful to him.)

626
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.850
We have to see the view.

627
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.959
- It looks amazing.
- It's different.

628
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.459
It's the best.

629
00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.659
(It's the first gift
the master is giving to his pupils.)

630
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.169
The view is so open here.

631
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:35.999
It's amazing.

632
00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:37.100
(The view from Baegunam
must've cooled his sweat.)

633
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.540
Seong Jae, this is why
you hike up a mountain.

634
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.969
I didn't see the view on the way up.

635
00:25:41.969 --> 00:25:43.040
This is why you hike.

636
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.179
(Because the hike was tough,)

637
00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:47.550
The view is amazing.

638
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.449
(the view touches them more.)

639
00:25:49.449 --> 00:25:50.550
The view is amazing.

640
00:25:51.749 --> 00:25:54.249
(Since 2005,
the master has been...)

641
00:25:54.249 --> 00:25:57.360
(hiking this mountain
every winter for 12 years.)

642
00:25:57.659 --> 00:26:00.530
- Let's go inside now.
- Let's go in.

643
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:01.959
Can we go inside the temple?

644
00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:03.999
- I already told them.
- Did you?

645
00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:05.060
Isn't he Chul Soo?

646
00:26:06.259 --> 00:26:07.570
(Fight with Chul Soo)

647
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.870
(Is the fight with Chul Soo...)

648
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.400
- Chul Soo.
- Chul Soo.

649
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.370
(the fight between
a tiger and a dog?)

650
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.370
No. No.

651
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.540
(He's not looking.)

652
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.979
- He's not Chul Soo.
- Stop imagining and come in.

653
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.550
(Why did he bring
the 4 young men here?)

654
00:26:28.249 --> 00:26:32.620
Do you live here?

655
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.560
(What?)

656
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.130
For a month?

657
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.560
No. I brought you here
to show you.

658
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.830
I wanted to show you
that I used to train here.

659
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.140
(It's Seong Jae's first time
to meet a national baseball player.)

660
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.209
I've always been curious.
The baseball players are...

661
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.669
(Does he have another question?)

662
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.280
Are your thighs...

663
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.479
all made up of muscles?

664
00:26:56.249 --> 00:26:57.249
(His eyes are shining brightly.)

665
00:26:58.419 --> 00:27:00.019
(Seong Jae's got
a lot of questions, hasn't he?)

666
00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:01.919
(He's worried.)

667
00:27:02.189 --> 00:27:03.449
I think he...

668
00:27:03.449 --> 00:27:06.060
You are rude, aren't you?

669
00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:09.159
I've got fat too.

670
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:13.429
There's no weight limit
for baseball players.

671
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.300
Honestly...

672
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.370
Is there anyone you feel
awkward talking to?

673
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.269
You seem to...

674
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:25.040
Because...

675
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.110
he's our master,
he tries to talk down to us.

676
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.419
- But he feels awkward doing it.
- He does.

677
00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:33.919
- Is there anyone difficult?
- There's nothing difficult.

678
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.259
You guys are younger than me,
so I feel comfortable.

679
00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:40.689
But I heard there's one person
who is older than me.

680
00:27:41.729 --> 00:27:42.860
So we have to talk about
how to address each other.

681
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.159
You are only our second master,

682
00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:48.169
so we are very careful.

683
00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:49.469
- What do we do?
- What should we do?

684
00:27:49.469 --> 00:27:51.199
I will call you master.

685
00:27:51.199 --> 00:27:52.469
How about "brother"?

686
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:55.370
- I like that.
- It contains respect.

687
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.939
- Brother.
- And let's talk down to each other.

688
00:27:57.979 --> 00:27:59.939
- Only when we're filming.
- Sounds good to me.

689
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.650
After the shoot,
I will treat you with respect.

690
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.949
- It's...
- I've been very curious.

691
00:28:05.949 --> 00:28:09.090
I was curious about
how you really...

692
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.159
take care of your body
in everyday life.

693
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.189
I have a feeling that it's going
to be very tough,

694
00:28:14.429 --> 00:28:17.560
but I love exercising. So I want to
experience it once.

695
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.400
(He really wanted to
meet Dae Ho.)

696
00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:23.600
How did you come to
train in this temple?

697
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:28.140
In 2005, I hit 20 home runs.
My batting average was 24 percent.

698
00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.769
(His batting average in 2005
was 24 percent.)

699
00:28:29.769 --> 00:28:33.280
They show the ranking
in newspapers.

700
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.749
About 40 to 50 players
are listed according to their ranks.

701
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.219
I always got either
49th or 50th place.

702
00:28:39.019 --> 00:28:40.919
So after the season,

703
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.790
our coach told me
I should go to this temple...

704
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.130
to develop myself.

705
00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:51.759
He told me to train
my body and mind.

706
00:28:52.759 --> 00:28:53.929
I wasn't sure what he wanted then.

707
00:28:53.929 --> 00:28:57.870
I thought hitting 20 home runs
was quite good.

708
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:02.370
I was young, so I listened to him
and came here to train.

709
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.209
(He trusted the coach
and started the training.)

710
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:08.679
Every morning, I climbed up
the mountain with an empty stomach.

711
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.449
I carried an apple.

712
00:29:11.719 --> 00:29:13.120
I started the hike 6:30am.

713
00:29:13.749 --> 00:29:16.150
It took me an hour to get here.

714
00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.159
So I thought I was near.

715
00:29:18.759 --> 00:29:21.360
But it took me four hours
to get to the summit.

716
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.830
- That's one way?
- One way.

717
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.959
Does it get even tougher?

718
00:29:24.959 --> 00:29:27.030
It gets tougher as you go up.

719
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.300
When I start hiking at 6:30am,

720
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.300
I would arrive at the restaurant
around 12 noon.

721
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.140
I had exactly half of the rice.

722
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.169
(He arrived at the restaurant
at noon and had half of the rice.)

723
00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:38.640
After eating that, I hiked again
until this temple.

724
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:41.280
That took an hour and half.

725
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.580
After doing that for two months,

726
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.050
I won the Triple Crown in 2006.

727
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.350
It was the turning point of my life.

728
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.550
(He won the Triple Crown in 2006.)

729
00:29:50.719 --> 00:29:52.689
Nothing had changed.

730
00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.989
But suddenly I won the Triple Crown.

731
00:29:55.989 --> 00:29:57.659
That surprised me too.

732
00:29:57.659 --> 00:30:01.929
Since then, I've had
a blind faith...

733
00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:03.370
in this mountain.

734
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.739
(Faith makes him climb up
this mountain every year.)

735
00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:17.380
Have you prepared
a lot of things for us to do?

736
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.050
There's nothing. You will be
following my routine.

737
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.150
(They will follow him.)

738
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.249
It will be fun.

739
00:30:23.449 --> 00:30:25.759
- Do we just have to follow you?
- It will be fun.

740
00:30:26.189 --> 00:30:30.630
I am curious about what the fight
with Chul Soo is all about.

741
00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:33.830
You will see.

742
00:30:34.169 --> 00:30:35.400
Oh, dear.

743
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.939
You should be excited.
We got a lot to do.

744
00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:42.070
(This was just a warm-up.)

745
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.209
(This is how
a national athlete lives.)

746
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:48.150
(The master's daily routine
nearly kills them.)

747
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.550
Is this the only way to go down?

748
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.880
We're going to take another path.
You took the easy path.

749
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.550
We will take the steep path
on the way down.

750
00:30:56.219 --> 00:30:57.320
Steep path?

751
00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:00.060
We have to hurry. We got no time.

752
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.159
- Is it a faster way?
- Yes, there's a faster way.

753
00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:03.860
- Is there a shortcut?
- There is.

754
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.929
It must've been much tougher
if we took the shortcut.

755
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.600
Right. It must be steeper there.

756
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.800
(What kind of a path would it be?)

757
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.400
It's a little scary.

758
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.840
(The barbed-wire fence
is place over a cliff.)

759
00:31:20.709 --> 00:31:22.110
I prepared this for you.

760
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.249
(And there's something...)

761
00:31:23.249 --> 00:31:24.449
(strange there.)

762
00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.949
Is this the shortcut?

763
00:31:26.449 --> 00:31:28.449
(What is that?)

764
00:31:29.689 --> 00:31:30.820
Look here.

765
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:33.929
What is it?

766
00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.290
(It's a monorail.)

767
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.400
That's so scary.

768
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.370
(Is this a dream?)

769
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.540
(They are thrilled
that they don't have to walk.)

770
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:47.640
I thought we were
going to walk down.

771
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.610
- What is this?
- Are we taking that?

772
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.840
- Really?
- That would be so fun.

773
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.350
Really?

774
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.050
(The railroad is like
a coiling snake.)

775
00:31:56.409 --> 00:31:58.919
(They're mesmerized by
this beautiful ride.)

776
00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:05.019
This is the shortcut.

777
00:32:06.459 --> 00:32:08.090
- This is amazing.
- It's going to be so fun.

778
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.060
This must stretch all the way down.

779
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.729
- This will be amazing.
- We will go down much quicker.

780
00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:13.429
- We can do down in no time.
- I never thought they'd have this.

781
00:32:13.429 --> 00:32:16.530
But it can't carry too many people.

782
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.469
We will play a game, and
I'll take the winner with me.

783
00:32:19.469 --> 00:32:22.009
The other three have to
take the same path down.

784
00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:23.469
(Those who lose the game
have to walk down.)

785
00:32:23.979 --> 00:32:25.080
Really?

786
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.380
(No way.)

787
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.449
(I want to ride it.)

788
00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:29.509
(I want to ride it.)

789
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:30.650
(I am desperate to ride it.)

790
00:32:31.179 --> 00:32:34.249
By the way, he weighs...

791
00:32:34.249 --> 00:32:35.390
You're out.

792
00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.060
Wait. That's not it.

793
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.189
- You're too talkative.
- No. No.

794
00:32:39.189 --> 00:32:40.290
- That's not it.
- Let's exclude him.

795
00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.030
If you talk once more,
you will walk down.

796
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.400
This is a TV show,
so I have to talk.

797
00:32:44.659 --> 00:32:46.860
I don't want to talk,
but we're on a TV show.

798
00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:47.969
(How can I not talk on a TV show?)

799
00:32:47.969 --> 00:32:49.999
I can't help it. Please understand.
I am a quiet person too.

800
00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:51.040
All right.

801
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.570
(I will cut you slack then.)

802
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.009
What game should we play?
Can you choose one?

803
00:32:56.209 --> 00:32:59.380
I'll test your strength. You know
the push game, don't you?

804
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.919
If two people win, I will walk.
I'll let the winners ride it.

805
00:33:03.949 --> 00:33:05.120
- Really?
- Of course.

806
00:33:05.749 --> 00:33:08.249
(I can't walk for another 2 hours.)

807
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.519
(I will ride the monorail.)

808
00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:12.959
Let's decide the order.

809
00:33:12.989 --> 00:33:14.360
Who will go first?
The winner or the loser?

810
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.390
Does anyone want to go first?

811
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.530
- You go first.
- You're the special forces soldier.

812
00:33:18.259 --> 00:33:19.999
- Me? Okay.
- Do you want to go first?

813
00:33:20.229 --> 00:33:21.499
Really?

814
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.300
He's just crazy.

815
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:25.499
I am not crazy.

816
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:27.709
- Go, Seung Gi.
- All right.

817
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.640
Let's do this.

818
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.580
- We will do it without a practice.
- Cheers!

819
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.780
No practice.

820
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.780
Here we go.

821
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.090
- Ready.
- Go, Master!

822
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.689
- What?
- Go, Master!

823
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.860
What?

824
00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.189
You said I am your role model.

825
00:33:47.429 --> 00:33:49.689
- He's strange.
- I cheer for you, Master!

826
00:33:50.189 --> 00:33:51.330
- We begin right away.
- Okay.

827
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.429
- Start.
- Start.

828
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.800
- Push like this.
- Okay.

829
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.600
(He fails if he moves
before the master moves.)

830
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.600
Even if he pushes lightly...

831
00:34:02.169 --> 00:34:04.080
My gosh.

832
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.679
(He faces the 1st crisis.)

833
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.449
(The special forces soldier
manages to survive.)

834
00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:10.719
- It was close.
- He survived.

835
00:34:11.479 --> 00:34:12.850
He survived.

836
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.850
(This is interesting.)

837
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:17.860
(The master teases Seung Gi.)

838
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.419
He's like a boy.

839
00:34:19.419 --> 00:34:21.659
(Seung Gi teases the master.)

840
00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:27.330
(Seung Gi faces the 2nd crisis.)

841
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.929
(Will he survive it again?)

842
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.809
So this is what happens.

843
00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:38.939
He looked pathetic.

844
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.809
Don't mention that you used
to be in the special forces.

845
00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:43.280
He lost so fast.

846
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.220
Seung Gi.

847
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.550
- Yes, Master.
- Go down.

848
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.689
Go down. Go down.

849
00:34:50.689 --> 00:34:52.559
I will start walking.

850
00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:54.530
(I have to hike
down the mountain.)

851
00:34:55.459 --> 00:34:57.800
(Se Hyeong is the next contender.)

852
00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:00.369
He's twice as big as me.

853
00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:01.900
In my opinion, he will be
walking down the mountain.

854
00:35:02.269 --> 00:35:03.869
- Just get it down.
- You might do well.

855
00:35:03.869 --> 00:35:05.599
He might get hurt.
I will put this on the floor.

856
00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:08.740
(It's like
a championship match for him.)

857
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.539
They look like father and son.

858
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.510
(Let's play, Dad.)

859
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.950
Se Hyeong is quite strong.

860
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:20.349
(I played the clap game
with my daddy.)

861
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.919
(But he doesn't seem to
want to lose to me.)

862
00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:25.919
- He wont' fall.
- He's quite good.

863
00:35:25.919 --> 00:35:27.360
(The father and son fight fiercely.)

864
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.930
- He's lasting long.
- I know.

865
00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.430
He's balancing well.

866
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.900
Short people are good at this.

867
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.169
Why would you say that?

868
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.099
- There's no such thing.
- All right.

869
00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.410
That's nonsense.

870
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.939
That's nonsense.

871
00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:46.510
(My dad is so harsh.)

872
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.579
I will...

873
00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:50.209
(He wants to avenge him.)

874
00:35:52.749 --> 00:35:54.990
I can't beat him with my strength.

875
00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.619
I need to avoid him. Right?

876
00:35:58.059 --> 00:36:00.459
Seong Jae, you won't have
a chance if you fight him.

877
00:36:03.229 --> 00:36:07.530
(He's desperate to ride
the monorail.)

878
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.869
(He's very determined.
What will be his strategy?)

879
00:36:12.869 --> 00:36:14.340
I am ready.

880
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.510
Start.

881
00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:20.550
But even if you avoid him,
you still lose.

882
00:36:20.849 --> 00:36:21.880
He...

883
00:36:21.954 --> 00:36:26.654
<font color="#F1E6B2">[Kocowa Ver] E04 Master in the House / All the Butlers</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

884
00:36:26.749 --> 00:36:27.889
He did it.

885
00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:30.019
He did it.

886
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.289
(They both moved.)

887
00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.360
You are a fool.

888
00:36:34.789 --> 00:36:36.789
Wait. Wait.

889
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.630
- It's hard to tell.
- Right?

890
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.599
It's hard to tell.

891
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.369
(They moved at the same time.)

892
00:36:50.939 --> 00:36:53.139
- It's hard to tell who won.
- Right?

893
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.349
- It's a tie.
- It's hard to tell.

894
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:55.950
- Stay aside.
- Let's decide later.

895
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:57.249
That's a good thing.

896
00:36:57.249 --> 00:36:59.680
- Everyone else might lose.
- Step aside.

897
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.820
It's a tie for now.

898
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.349
(If Yang Yun lose too,)

899
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:05.189
(Seong Jae will be
riding the monorail.)

900
00:37:06.789 --> 00:37:08.990
(He tenses up.)

901
00:37:11.059 --> 00:37:14.630
(If the master loses
to Sang Yun...)

902
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.039
Master must feel worried.

903
00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:18.499
He widened his stance.

904
00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:21.539
(Sang Yun tries to
plant himself on the ground.)

905
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.309
Sang Yun is finished analyzing.

906
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:25.639
(Has Sang Yun finished analyzing?)

907
00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:28.010
Lose, Sang Yun! Lose, Sang Yun!

908
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.050
(I want to take the monorail
with the master.)

909
00:37:29.849 --> 00:37:30.950
Okay.

910
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.050
(Here comes the elite.)

911
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.180
Start.

912
00:37:34.289 --> 00:37:35.550
By the way... What's that?

913
00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:38.059
Hey. Hey.

914
00:37:39.059 --> 00:37:40.930
By the way... What's that?

915
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.959
(Let me bow to you.)

916
00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:45.130
Hey. Hey.

917
00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.130
- What's that? Hey.
- Hey.

918
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.729
(They are upset.)

919
00:37:48.729 --> 00:37:50.030
Gosh.

920
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.539
(He loves his alma matar so much.)

921
00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:52.769
- Hey.
- Hey.

922
00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:56.639
(I had to bow to my master.)

923
00:37:57.709 --> 00:37:59.240
- Come on.
- Come on.

924
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.849
(He embarrassed himself.)

925
00:38:01.749 --> 00:38:02.849
(His failure is my joy.)

926
00:38:02.849 --> 00:38:05.079
That was pathetic.

927
00:38:05.079 --> 00:38:06.680
He looked really weak.

928
00:38:06.919 --> 00:38:09.189
(My pride fell to the ground.)

929
00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.660
Today's winner is...

930
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.760
Seong Jae. Let's go.

931
00:38:17.059 --> 00:38:19.030
He hates hiking.

932
00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:20.470
Don't listen to that.

933
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.900
- Okay?
- I'll see you later.

934
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.470
- Be careful.
- Bye, Seong Jae.

935
00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.300
When will I get to
ride this in the mountain?

936
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.840
(This is where
the monorail departs.)

937
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.780
Nice! Nice!

938
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:35.709
I can't believe I got so lucky.

939
00:38:35.979 --> 00:38:37.180
It's like a dream.

940
00:38:37.419 --> 00:38:39.079
I am terrible at playing games.

941
00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.419
But I think the others
are even worse than me.

942
00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.019
(What is he saying?)

943
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.660
We have to face this way.

944
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.530
(He's heavy.)

945
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.829
I want to walk with Seung Gi.

946
00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.700
My gosh.
I didn't want to ride it.

947
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.169
I have to exercise.

948
00:38:56.169 --> 00:38:57.470
(He teases his pupils.)

949
00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.570
- Here we go.
- This is amazing.

950
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.939
- Be careful.
- Bye.

951
00:39:00.939 --> 00:39:03.010
- What makes this move?
- It's in the back.

952
00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:04.840
- It's 1.1km long.
- Wait.

953
00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:06.740
It's fast.

954
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.709
(Seong Jae departs
with the master.)

955
00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:10.249
(Oh!)

956
00:39:10.249 --> 00:39:12.650
(It's faster than they thought.)

957
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.090
It's fast.

958
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:18.459
(It's like a ride
at an amusement park.)

959
00:39:18.459 --> 00:39:19.590
This is crazy.

960
00:39:22.329 --> 00:39:24.499
- It's fast.
- It's fast.

961
00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.869
(It's like riding a ride.)

962
00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:31.070
This is really amazing.

963
00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.599
It looks beautiful.

964
00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:35.669
(They get to enjoy the view.
It's a perfect way to descend.)

965
00:39:35.669 --> 00:39:38.110
When hiking up the mountain,

966
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.809
I was so tired that
I only stared at the ground.

967
00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:41.979
Now I get to enjoy the view.

968
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:46.150
I wouldn't have been able to
enjoy it if I was walking.

969
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.720
(He would've missed it
if he busily walked down.)

970
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.150
(Seong Jae and the master
enjoy the view.)

971
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.459
This is amazing.

972
00:39:51.919 --> 00:39:53.019
(He's excited.)

973
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.130
(When they go down
along the ridge,)

974
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.660
(they get to see the whole
view of Yangsan.)

975
00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.959
This is amazing.

976
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:03.530
(They stare at
Seong Jae and the master's back.)

977
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.599
(He feels sad that he lost.)

978
00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:07.769
(He envies them.)

979
00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:08.939
It looks fun.

980
00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.209
It looks fun.

981
00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:13.539
- Are they going that way?
- But...

982
00:40:13.539 --> 00:40:15.709
That way.

983
00:40:15.709 --> 00:40:16.880
It must be cold.

984
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.550
(He hopes they get cold.)

985
00:40:19.979 --> 00:40:21.619
- Let's go.
- Can't we stop it from here?

986
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:25.519
Why are you sad
that you lost?

987
00:40:25.519 --> 00:40:27.590
- Just accept it.
- What? I am enjoying this.

988
00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.990
I wanted to walk.

989
00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.260
I love hiking.

990
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.229
You were going to
turn off the power.

991
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.200
- I wasn't.
- What's wrong with you?

992
00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:36.499
Let's laugh it off.

993
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:38.240
You can't get upset.

994
00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.240
(That's not it.)

995
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.939
I really wanted to ride it.

996
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.680
It's good...

997
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.010
- that Seong Jae won.
- It's a good thing.

998
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.880
- He hated hiking so much.
- Descending is more dangerous.

999
00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.919
I can't forget about...

1000
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.889
how happy Seong Jae looked
as he was descending.

1001
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.289
Bye.

1002
00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:59.820
(Were you that happy?)

1003
00:41:00.329 --> 00:41:01.689
Be careful on the way down.

1004
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:04.900
(They pretended to be cool,
but they are frustrated...)

1005
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.430
When will we go down?
My legs hurt.

1006
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:08.800
(to go down.)

1007
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.809
Seong Jae seemed so happy.

1008
00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.709
Seong Jae looked happy.

1009
00:41:15.939 --> 00:41:17.880
(They didn't know until then.)

1010
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.709
He must be happy.

1011
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:22.510
(They didn't know
that their words...)

1012
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.550
This is unfair.

1013
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.280
(would make Seung Gi
burn with desire to win.)

1014
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.820
Master!

1015
00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:30.389
(They never knew
that their words...)

1016
00:41:30.389 --> 00:41:32.019
Yes!

1017
00:41:32.019 --> 00:41:33.660
(would return to them as fire.)

1018
00:41:35.289 --> 00:41:36.959
We're at about the same altitude
as the monorail.

1019
00:41:36.959 --> 00:41:38.930
(They're not far behind.)

1020
00:41:39.229 --> 00:41:42.070
Should I run down?

1021
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:48.610
(Seung Gi started to run.)

1022
00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:50.680
I heard their voice
from the other side,

1023
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.240
and I think we're
not too far behind.

1024
00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:56.479
I am going to try
to catch up with them.

1025
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.249
Let's go.

1026
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.189
- Seung Gi is really fast.
- What?

1027
00:42:02.189 --> 00:42:03.590
Seung Gi is really fast.

1028
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.689
He thinks he's still
a special forces soldier.

1029
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.090
When did you get
discharged from the army?

1030
00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.959
(He was discharged from
the army only a month ago.)

1031
00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:14.400
(He's overflowing with confidence.)

1032
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.099
(He did his army service
in the mountain.)

1033
00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.999
(He thinks you're supposed...)

1034
00:42:18.999 --> 00:42:22.309
(to run through the mountain.)

1035
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.709
Look at Seung Gi.

1036
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.039
Seung Gi is mad.

1037
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.309
The master is watching.

1038
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:32.450
(What is wrong
with Seung GI?)

1039
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.289
(He thinks a mountain
makes a man look great.)

1040
00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:39.720
(This mountain will
make me look great.)

1041
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.229
(Seung Gi's camera)

1042
00:42:42.229 --> 00:42:44.329
(The crew members
are surprised.)

1043
00:42:45.499 --> 00:42:49.169
(They are surprised
to see Seung Gi.)

1044
00:42:49.169 --> 00:42:50.700
I am trying to catch up with them.

1045
00:42:51.939 --> 00:42:53.139
- It's scary.
- Wait.

1046
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.570
I will go down first.

1047
00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.269
(He's proud.)

1048
00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.939
Wait.

1049
00:42:59.939 --> 00:43:02.410
Seung Gi got mad,
and he's running down alone.

1050
00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:05.320
There's nobody...

1051
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.249
who can stop Seung Gi.

1052
00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:08.919
(His cameraman urges
someone to stop him.)

1053
00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.019
Why is he running?

1054
00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:11.789
(Please stop Seung Gi.)

1055
00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:12.860
Why is Seung Gi running?

1056
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.990
(Seung Gi disapperaed
from the frame suddenly.)

1057
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.660
Someone in the crew should use
their phone to keep shooting!

1058
00:43:20.059 --> 00:43:22.700
(The camera operator who was
following him runs into Sang Yun.)

1059
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.700
Try to keep recording videos
of yourself using the GoPro.

1060
00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.939
Okay.

1061
00:43:27.169 --> 00:43:28.410
Please be careful.

1062
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:31.110
(Why is he turning the lens
that way?)

1063
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.280
(Sang Yun's camera)

1064
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.809
(No, not me.)

1065
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.579
Use the GoPro.

1066
00:43:36.579 --> 00:43:37.849
(Just like that, Sang Yun...)

1067
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:41.220
(kept recording videos
of the crew members.)

1068
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.490
Seung Gi!

1069
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.889
(Se Hyeong's camera)

1070
00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.630
Slow down!

1071
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:51.930
It looks like he actually thinks
that he's Sun Wukong.

1072
00:43:53.669 --> 00:43:54.769
My feet.

1073
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.970
The left foot and the right foot
like this.

1074
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.910
1, 2, let's go. 3, 4, let's go.

1075
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:03.309
This is my running route.
1, 2, let's go.

1076
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:04.880
3, 4, let's go.

1077
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.450
My feet feel light.
Left and right, like this.

1078
00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.209
1, 2. Left and right.

1079
00:44:09.479 --> 00:44:11.019
As I'm passing
through the fallen leaves...

1080
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.490
(Se Hyeong's camera)

1081
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:19.019
(He uses the rock as a tripod.)

1082
00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:21.789
(And he throws the leaves
into the air.)

1083
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.829
Put on a little show like that,
and I'll keep going down.

1084
00:44:29.229 --> 00:44:30.740
I must take a shot of my feet too.

1085
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.539
(What happens to Se Hyeong
when Seung Gi goes crazy)

1086
00:44:32.539 --> 00:44:33.599
My feet.

1087
00:44:34.709 --> 00:44:38.809
(The master and Seong Jae are
enjoying the peaceful scenery.)

1088
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:39.910
What?

1089
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.510
(He saw something.)

1090
00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:43.919
- I see them.
- They're coming down.

1091
00:44:43.919 --> 00:44:45.019
I see them.

1092
00:44:45.019 --> 00:44:46.380
(Running down)

1093
00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.689
Se Hyeong!

1094
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.990
Se Hyeong!

1095
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:53.320
- What?
- My gosh!

1096
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:54.990
Where are you?

1097
00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:56.559
Where are you?

1098
00:44:56.559 --> 00:44:57.800
(I'm here!)

1099
00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.160
Hi!

1100
00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:03.499
I see him. He's over there!

1101
00:45:05.099 --> 00:45:07.570
Let's go meet the master.
I'm going to meet the master.

1102
00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.039
I'm on my way to meet the master!

1103
00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.209
The members are running.
I think I should run too.

1104
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:17.749
(Everyone is running.)

1105
00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.650
The master.
I'm on my way to meet the master.

1106
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.119
(The master's voice
made Se Hyeong run.)

1107
00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.220
Se Hyeong.

1108
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.519
(He stops when he hears
Seong Jae's voice.)

1109
00:45:24.519 --> 00:45:25.619
Se Hyeong.

1110
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.490
Are you exhausted?

1111
00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.530
- Are you exhausted?
- No, I'm having fun.

1112
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.260
We're having fun too.

1113
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.300
(He puts on a fake smile.)

1114
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:37.840
(I'm having so much fun.)

1115
00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.639
(These leaves are really beautiful.)

1116
00:45:41.769 --> 00:45:43.010
(He throws the leaves into the air.)

1117
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:45.410
(Why do we only see the two?)

1118
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.639
Where's Seung Gi?

1119
00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.780
Men look cool
when they do things like that.

1120
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.349
(Seung Gi is...
We don't know where he is.)

1121
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.349
I'll go slow. I'll go down slowly.

1122
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:56.990
(But why are his feet
moving so fast?)

1123
00:45:57.189 --> 00:45:59.490
When you do a march
in the military...

1124
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:00.530
(Why is he talking about that now?)

1125
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.889
You have to walk fast like this.

1126
00:46:02.889 --> 00:46:04.160
(We have no idea
what he's thinking.)

1127
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.200
That's how I learned
to hike quickly.

1128
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.200
Let's go. Let's go. Like this.

1129
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.809
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.

1130
00:46:13.809 --> 00:46:15.510
(He sure is very determined.)

1131
00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:20.309
Okay.

1132
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:22.680
(He's going crazy.)

1133
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:26.150
I think I'm almost there.

1134
00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:29.820
Just do it and make it happen.

1135
00:46:30.459 --> 00:46:31.760
Gosh, my goodness.

1136
00:46:32.519 --> 00:46:34.959
(Startled, we started shooting
with a cell phone.)

1137
00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.470
(The end is near.)

1138
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.139
I beat them, right?

1139
00:46:45.139 --> 00:46:47.769
(Did he really beat
the monorail cable car?)

1140
00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:48.910
I beat them, right?

1141
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.209
(A crew member is shooting
with her cell phone.)

1142
00:46:51.209 --> 00:46:52.280
They aren't here yet, right?

1143
00:46:54.579 --> 00:46:56.410
(I beat them!)

1144
00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.349
Nice, I did it!

1145
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:59.380
(He makes a V with his fingers.)

1146
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.860
I did it! I beat them.

1147
00:47:04.059 --> 00:47:05.189
(Seung Gi, the gold medalist)

1148
00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:06.389
I surprised you guys, didn't I?

1149
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.260
(He can finally relax.)

1150
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.700
I ran so fast.

1151
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.869
Seong Jae, you saw this, right?

1152
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.900
(Seung Gi, look at my face.)

1153
00:47:19.769 --> 00:47:20.869
(I'm exhausted.)

1154
00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:23.070
(I'm really exhausted now.)

1155
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.010
(I'm beyond exhausted.)

1156
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.780
(He can't even talk anymore.)

1157
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.510
(He stopped recording videos too.)

1158
00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.550
(Se Hyeong and Sang Yun
ran for a while.)

1159
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.090
Oh, I see cars. I see cars!

1160
00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:38.590
It's the parking lot.

1161
00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:40.360
Se Hyeong, it's the parking lot!

1162
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:43.829
We beat them. We totally beat them.

1163
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:46.530
We beat the monorail. We won.
We're the winners.

1164
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.800
- We won.
- We're the winners.

1165
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.269
- We beat them.
- We won!

1166
00:47:49.269 --> 00:47:50.400
We won.

1167
00:47:51.169 --> 00:47:53.539
(Sang Yun and Se Hyeong are
happy about winning too.)

1168
00:47:53.539 --> 00:47:54.669
We beat them.

1169
00:47:54.809 --> 00:47:56.309
We're watching them coming down.

1170
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.110
(But these guys don't care.)

1171
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.780
(Those on the cable car
look so happy.)

1172
00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.880
Guys!

1173
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.680
(The real gold medalists arrive.)

1174
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:08.590
Yes!

1175
00:48:09.689 --> 00:48:10.720
We made it.

1176
00:48:10.889 --> 00:48:13.189
(Just like that, Seung Gi, Sang Yun,
and Se Hyeong's battle ends.)

1177
00:48:13.189 --> 00:48:15.059
- Where are we going now?
- Fight with Chul Soo.

1178
00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:16.130
Yes, that's right.

1179
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.829
(Fight with Chul Soo)

1180
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:23.630
(They're on their way to fight
with Chul Soo in the master's car.)

1181
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.700
Then how long have you lived
in Busan?

1182
00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.769
36 years. I mean...

1183
00:48:27.769 --> 00:48:29.809
- He's originally from Busan.
- I was born in Busan.

1184
00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.709
I've lived in Busan all my life
except the five years I was abroad.

1185
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.849
(He's lived in Busan for 32 years.)

1186
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:36.450
I think it's great.

1187
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:38.280
Aren't there many good
Chinese restaurants in Busan?

1188
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.220
- There's a ton.
- I heard.

1189
00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.249
(Salivating)

1190
00:48:41.849 --> 00:48:44.260
There was a time when I used to
pig out so much.

1191
00:48:44.419 --> 00:48:47.090
- I lived to eat.
- I live to eat too.

1192
00:48:48.689 --> 00:48:50.700
- Food makes me most happy.
- Everyone is like that.

1193
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.099
We all earn money in order
to be able to...

1194
00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:54.430
- buy ourselves good food.
- Right?

1195
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.369
- I'm like that.
- Same here.

1196
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.039
I got into baseball to be able
to buy myself foods I wanted to eat.

1197
00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:02.610
That's what I thought as a kid.
My family was very poor,

1198
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.410
and I was the happiest...

1199
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.410
when my grandmother ordered a
fried chicken for me and my brother.

1200
00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:08.880
- What did she order?
- A whole fried chicken.

1201
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.150
A whole chicken? Did you eat
the whole thing by yourself?

1202
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.820
I have a brother,
so we had to share it,

1203
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.689
and it was never enough.

1204
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.490
But that still made me so happy.

1205
00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.289
So at the beginning, you earned
money to buy yourself good food.

1206
00:49:23.289 --> 00:49:24.930
Yes, I really did. When I was young,

1207
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:28.300
I thought I'd be able to make
a lot of money through baseball.

1208
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:30.169
To be able to eat good food...

1209
00:49:30.169 --> 00:49:33.169
and buy my grandmother
delicious things,

1210
00:49:33.169 --> 00:49:34.369
I focused on baseball
and worked hard.

1211
00:49:34.369 --> 00:49:36.010
(I'll earn money and buy
delicious food for my grandma.)

1212
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.180
(He became the country's best
cleanup hitter for his family.)

1213
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.180
Then what does it feel like
to join the national team?

1214
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.349
(That boy joined the national team.)

1215
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:45.249
- When it becomes official.
- I'm so curious.

1216
00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:47.849
When you have the national flag
right here.

1217
00:49:47.849 --> 00:49:48.950
When you have that...

1218
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.490
(Reverent)

1219
00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.689
You can't help but think this.

1220
00:49:56.059 --> 00:50:00.130
You feel that you have to sacrifice
yourself for the country.

1221
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.200
More importantly, whenever
there's a game against Japan...

1222
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.410
(How does it feel to play
in games against Japan?)

1223
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.669
We play thinking that losing
the game will be the end of us.

1224
00:50:10.979 --> 00:50:14.079
- Gosh, it's... It's really...
- Why would that be?

1225
00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:16.010
- We take it more seriously.
- The pressure is...

1226
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.079
(It's because of our history.)

1227
00:50:17.079 --> 00:50:18.119
Even we feel the same way.

1228
00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:19.880
- Whenever it's against Japan...
- Exactly.

1229
00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.220
If we lose...

1230
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.119
(What happens if you lose?)

1231
00:50:23.119 --> 00:50:24.490
(What happens?)

1232
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:29.389
You can hear all sorts of
swear words the elders can say.

1233
00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.200
(That's sad but hilarious.)

1234
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.229
That's so true.

1235
00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.900
(It's almost time
for the fight with Chul Soo.)

1236
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.709
- It's really...
- Can you tell us one thing?

1237
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.979
Do we need to warm up
for the fight with Chul Soo or not?

1238
00:50:45.539 --> 00:50:46.939
(He doesn't answer.)

1239
00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:50.280
(We won't have to exercise again,
right?)

1240
00:50:50.919 --> 00:50:52.419
Will it be fun?

1241
00:50:52.419 --> 00:50:54.090
(Se Hyeong is really chatty.)

1242
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.689
How fun is it
on the scale of 1 to 10?

1243
00:50:57.689 --> 00:50:59.019
(Please rate how fun it is.)

1244
00:51:00.389 --> 00:51:01.689
(Thinking hard)

1245
00:51:02.889 --> 00:51:03.959
About eight?

1246
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.499
- Oh, it must be fun.
- It must be fun.

1247
00:51:05.499 --> 00:51:07.369
Will we feel the same way though?

1248
00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:08.630
- Of course.
- Really?

1249
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:09.729
- Yes.
- I see.

1250
00:51:09.729 --> 00:51:12.039
- I'm suddenly getting excited.
- Seriously?

1251
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.470
Chul Soo...

1252
00:51:16.869 --> 00:51:18.809
(It looks like they're
almost at their destination.)

1253
00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:21.180
(The master suddenly makes a turn.)

1254
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.209
(What's going on?)

1255
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.450
Is this where
the fight will take place?

1256
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:29.490
(They're here to fight
with Chul Soo.)

1257
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.419
Yes, you guys will have
to fight with Chul Soo.

1258
00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.559
- What is this place?
- Gosh, I knew it.

1259
00:51:35.289 --> 00:51:37.800
(The place that made Se Hyeong sigh)

1260
00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:41.800
It's a gym.

1261
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.570
(It's a fitness center.)

1262
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.400
- Yoga and what?
- Gosh, I totally knew it.

1263
00:51:45.539 --> 00:51:47.340
- Goodness!
- Let's go, guys.

1264
00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:49.970
I shouldn't have run down
the mountain like that.

1265
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.639
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm exhausted now.

1266
00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:55.309
Let's go. Don't say you're tired.
We said we'd do this.

1267
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:56.309
You guys took a little break.

1268
00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.749
Do you actually lift weights
for four hours?

1269
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.419
(All he think about is exercise.)

1270
00:52:01.689 --> 00:52:03.450
- It must be here.
- Let's go in, guys. This is it.

1271
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:07.189
(The master welcomes them
with his arms crossed.)

1272
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.760
(Fight with Chul Soo)

1273
00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:13.160
- I see a photo of Master.
- I know.

1274
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.269
(Who is Chul Soo?)

1275
00:52:14.269 --> 00:52:15.369
Chul Soo.

1276
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:16.530
You guys made it.

1277
00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:18.070
(Chul Soo?)

1278
00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:22.110
(He exudes a unique aura.)

1279
00:52:24.209 --> 00:52:25.340
I brought them.

1280
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:29.180
(They're very nervous.)

1281
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.119
- Hello.
- Hello.

1282
00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:32.180
- Who is he?
- Hello.

1283
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.789
- Hello.
- Hello.

1284
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:35.150
Think of Chul Soo...

1285
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.590
as your drill instructor.

1286
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.660
(He's the master's
personal trainer.)

1287
00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.499
(Climbing the mountain
was just a warm-up.)

1288
00:52:45.499 --> 00:52:49.269
(You'll experience a nightmare.)

1289
00:52:49.269 --> 00:52:51.970
(There's no exit.)

1290
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.169
(Hurry up and just do it.)

1291
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:54.970
Se Hyeong, you need to smile.

1292
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:56.869
(Annoyed)

1293
00:52:59.079 --> 00:53:01.010
(They can't even look at him...)

1294
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:03.380
(because they're
intimidated by his charisma.)

1295
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.519
He's been my personal trainer
for the last five years.

1296
00:53:07.189 --> 00:53:09.490
(I'll train you guys too.)

1297
00:53:10.519 --> 00:53:12.490
First off, you guys look
so tense right now,

1298
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.789
so smile a little.

1299
00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.559
If you don't smile,
there will be a penalty.

1300
00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:18.360
You'll have to work out more.
You must keep smiling.

1301
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.400
If you grimace, we'll double the
amount of workout you have to do.

1302
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.530
Okay, got it.

1303
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.869
(Grimace, and the amount
will be doubled.)

1304
00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:23.970
- It'll be doubled.
- Okay, got it.

1305
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:25.970
Got it?

1306
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:27.340
- Yes.
- Got it.

1307
00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:30.039
Go get changed and get ready.

1308
00:53:30.039 --> 00:53:31.079
Let's go get changed, guys.

1309
00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:32.780
Please go that way.

1310
00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:33.880
(They go into the changing room.)

1311
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.280
I mean,
we're not at an amusement park.

1312
00:53:35.479 --> 00:53:36.550
We have to take off our shoes.

1313
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:39.450
I'm annoyed.

1314
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:40.689
(They're already annoyed.)

1315
00:53:40.689 --> 00:53:43.650
- You're actually annoyed.
- Yes, I'm annoyed right now.

1316
00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.820
My legs feel so weak.
The muscles feel so tight too.

1317
00:53:45.959 --> 00:53:48.090
I must say, I think this is wrong.

1318
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.490
- What?
- This is...

1319
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:52.329
- Hey, this is...
- Work out after hiking like that?

1320
00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:55.269
Too much exercise isn't good.

1321
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.729
First, we should...

1322
00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:59.240
This is crazy.

1323
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.470
(Everyone is in despair.)

1324
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.240
It's just a cotton T-shirt.

1325
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.709
Well... First, we should...

1326
00:54:05.979 --> 00:54:08.180
- Sang Yun, why are you so tanned?
- What happened to you?

1327
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:10.749
- Where have you been?
- You look like...

1328
00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:12.849
No, my skin is just...

1329
00:54:12.849 --> 00:54:14.050
You're so tanned.

1330
00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.789
There he goes again.

1331
00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:19.160
Put this on already! Just put it on.

1332
00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.760
I will. I had to take off my shirt
to put this on.

1333
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.990
Put it on already.

1334
00:54:22.229 --> 00:54:24.499
- You had more than enough time.
- I'm putting it on now.

1335
00:54:24.499 --> 00:54:25.930
You two are so obnoxious.

1336
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:27.430
We had to take off our shirts first.

1337
00:54:28.269 --> 00:54:29.769
(Seung Gi is putting it on
as slowly as he can.)

1338
00:54:30.269 --> 00:54:32.070
- Right?
- Oh, I put it on backwards.

1339
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:33.300
(I put it on backwards.)

1340
00:54:33.439 --> 00:54:34.840
- You did it on purpose, didn't you?
- He totally did.

1341
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:35.939
(He shows off his muscles again.)

1342
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:38.610
- No, I didn't.
- Put it on, will you?

1343
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.079
- Put it on, please.
- Okay, I will.

1344
00:54:41.079 --> 00:54:42.180
(Please put it on!)

1345
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.280
You're so impatient.

1346
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.450
(They're suddenly worried.)

1347
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:49.950
(Even his feet look anxious.)

1348
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.119
I don't think it'll be...

1349
00:54:52.119 --> 00:54:55.760
the normal kind of weight training
we're thinking of.

1350
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.229
- I think it'll be very challenging.
- Yes.

1351
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.470
(Being an athlete is really tough.)

1352
00:55:00.669 --> 00:55:02.599
So, this is
"Fight with Chul Soo", right?

1353
00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:04.869
It begins now. Let's go.
I'll take you guys to him.

1354
00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:07.510
- What is that?
- Oh, what's that?

1355
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.340
This is my favorite workout.

1356
00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.039
- Men must have strong legs.
- That's true.

1357
00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:14.749
All right.
It's leg press, Dae Ho's favorite.

1358
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.050
A strong lower body helps you
keep your balance.

1359
00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.079
Maintaining good balance
is important in baseball.

1360
00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:22.820
Pitchers also need strong legs
to keep their balance.

1361
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.860
So it's not as easy as I thought.

1362
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:25.959
(It's not easy to
get the posture right.)

1363
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.559
At my peak in wintertime,
I go up to 600kg.

1364
00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:30.059
(He can go up to 600kg.)

1365
00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:32.499
600kg? I can't even imagine
what it'd be like.

1366
00:55:32.499 --> 00:55:33.769
(Just hearing it makes
our legs wobble.)

1367
00:55:33.769 --> 00:55:34.869
600kg?

1368
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:36.570
That's only 200kg though.

1369
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.900
- Do you want to give it a try?
- Try it.

1370
00:55:38.939 --> 00:55:39.970
(Does anyone want to try?)

1371
00:55:40.539 --> 00:55:43.639
Seong Jae definitely
won't be able to do it.

1372
00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.039
- First, I think...
- Yes.

1373
00:55:46.579 --> 00:55:47.579
(Me?)

1374
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:49.950
You're probably the best one
out of all of us.

1375
00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.550
You seem the strongest
You should give it a try.

1376
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.849
It's the lightest, you know.

1377
00:55:54.849 --> 00:55:57.389
- Try it.
- I can do it. I can totally do it.

1378
00:55:57.389 --> 00:55:58.789
- I think Seung Gi can do it.
- I can do this.

1379
00:55:58.959 --> 00:56:00.530
Wait, hang on. Now, go on it.

1380
00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.889
- Give it a shot.
- 200kg? Okay.

1381
00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.829
Place your feet apart. Like this.

1382
00:56:05.959 --> 00:56:08.369
It'll be hard because we hiked.
He probably won't be able to do it.

1383
00:56:08.769 --> 00:56:10.400
1, 2, 3. Push.

1384
00:56:10.939 --> 00:56:12.599
Hang on. Just a second.

1385
00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:13.709
1, 2, 3. Push.

1386
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.869
(I can't do it.)

1387
00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:17.309
How can you be so confident?

1388
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:20.579
- I really can't do it.
- Dae Ho can do it with one leg.

1389
00:56:20.579 --> 00:56:22.479
- Try it again.
- Just a second. I'm so flustered.

1390
00:56:22.809 --> 00:56:25.249
- Get ready. 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

1391
00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.820
- Wait, hang on.
- Goodness.

1392
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.249
- You pulled it, didn't you?
- No, I pushed it.

1393
00:56:29.249 --> 00:56:31.189
Really? It felt like
you were pulling it.

1394
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.289
I'm serious.

1395
00:56:32.289 --> 00:56:33.760
(Seung Gi is playing hard to get.)

1396
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.689
Why isn't it budging?
Shall I try again?

1397
00:56:35.689 --> 00:56:39.200
All right, let's try again.
Power up, okay? 1, 2, 3!

1398
00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:41.570
- We definitely can't do it.
- All right.

1399
00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:42.599
Three!

1400
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:44.740
(He finally pushed it up.)

1401
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.139
Okay. Slowly. Do it slowly.

1402
00:56:47.139 --> 00:56:49.209
Come down now. More, more.

1403
00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.180
Wait, I can't do this.
Because I hiked earlier...

1404
00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.939
- No, you can do it.
- Shall I keep trying?

1405
00:56:52.939 --> 00:56:55.280
- Shall I give it another shot?
- More, keep going.

1406
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.680
- Wait, I'm not faking this.
- You can do it.

1407
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.479
- I'm serious. Sir.
- You can totally do it.

1408
00:56:58.479 --> 00:57:00.180
- Chul Soo, I really can't.
- I'll hold it for you.

1409
00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.019
- Chul Soo won't let you go.
- Chul Soo, please.

1410
00:57:02.019 --> 00:57:04.220
- He never gives up.
- More, more.

1411
00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.320
Fight, fight!

1412
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.959
- More, more. Keep going.
- Gosh.

1413
00:57:07.959 --> 00:57:09.689
- Goodness.
- Push. Do it again. Two more.

1414
00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:11.260
- Just three more.
- No, I really can't.

1415
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.829
- I'm serious. Today...
- You can do it.

1416
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:14.400
Do you know which mountain
I climbed today?

1417
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.930
- I climbed a high mountain.
- All right.

1418
00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:17.970
- 1.
- I'll do just 1 more.

1419
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:19.700
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1420
00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.669
- Seung Gi negotiated with him.
- Use your chest muscles.

1421
00:57:21.669 --> 00:57:25.039
More, more. Keep going.

1422
00:57:25.039 --> 00:57:26.240
(Laughing)

1423
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.309
- Okay.
- Good, you did it.

1424
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:29.450
(He did it 2 times.)

1425
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:31.749
- Just in case you get injured...
- Gosh, this is no joke.

1426
00:57:31.749 --> 00:57:34.749
I'm telling you. I thought I was
going to be pushed underground.

1427
00:57:34.749 --> 00:57:35.849
It's really heavy.

1428
00:57:35.849 --> 00:57:38.860
- We hiked earlier today.
- It won't even budge.

1429
00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:40.760
I didn't know
my lower body was so weak.

1430
00:57:41.689 --> 00:57:42.789
Cheer up, guys.

1431
00:57:43.229 --> 00:57:45.559
So this is just a warm-up?

1432
00:57:45.559 --> 00:57:47.400
Master, what's the maximum
you can lift with this?

1433
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.769
Right now,
at least between 400 and 500kg.

1434
00:57:49.769 --> 00:57:52.769
Why don't we try it with you guys?

1435
00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:53.970
(He'll lift the members.)

1436
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.369
(He'll lift us?)

1437
00:57:56.369 --> 00:57:57.510
- Us?
- Yes.

1438
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:58.780
2 of you will increase it by 100kg.

1439
00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:01.479
- Two of you...
- You can lift us on top of that?

1440
00:58:01.479 --> 00:58:03.150
I can lift two of you
if you sit up here.

1441
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:05.119
- If Se Hyeong and I go up...
- I weigh 65kg.

1442
00:58:05.119 --> 00:58:06.280
I weigh 69kg now.

1443
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.950
- Oh, really?
- Then it'll go up by 130kg.

1444
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:10.860
- Will it be okay?
- Of course. It'll only be 334kg.

1445
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.959
(It'll only be 334kg.)

1446
00:58:13.459 --> 00:58:16.329
("Only 334kg"?)

1447
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.959
Then, you guys should sit up there.
Yes, the two of you.

1448
00:58:19.099 --> 00:58:20.470
- Go.
- Se Hyeong first.

1449
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.400
- Should I sit here?
- Right here.

1450
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.139
- Will this...
- I bet you're good at this.

1451
00:58:24.139 --> 00:58:25.869
Yes. Going up there is no problem.

1452
00:58:26.499 --> 00:58:28.410
Step on this thing, then this.

1453
00:58:28.669 --> 00:58:30.309
- Like this?
- Oh, like this.

1454
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:32.180
- Like this, right?
- Yes, that looks good.

1455
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.950
I'll do it quickly so that you guys
won't have to stay there for long.

1456
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.950
Isn't this too... Dae Ho,
wouldn't this be too much for you?

1457
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:39.320
- No, it's fine.
- It's still not late.

1458
00:58:39.479 --> 00:58:41.389
If you're doing this
just to show us...

1459
00:58:41.389 --> 00:58:43.590
Hold on to that thing.
Hold tight, okay?

1460
00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:44.660
- Here we go.
- 1, 2, 3.

1461
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.229
(Will the master succeed
right away?)

1462
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.760
(Unbelievable)

1463
00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:56.430
Do it slowly. Go.

1464
00:58:56.430 --> 00:59:01.039
Go slowly. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1465
00:59:01.439 --> 00:59:03.539
- 5, 6.
- My gosh, I'm totally amazed.

1466
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.079
7, 8, 9. The last one!

1467
00:59:07.579 --> 00:59:10.680
Okay. Come back down slowly. Good.

1468
00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.189
- Stay there.
- Sorry?

1469
00:59:14.189 --> 00:59:15.650
(Don't move.)

1470
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.090
- Will you add more people?
- You want to add more?

1471
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.660
The two of you should go up too.

1472
00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.660
- All of us?
- I'm quite heavy though.

1473
00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:25.660
Right now, it's at 340kg.
Even if you each weigh 70kg,

1474
00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:27.769
it'll only be around 500kg.

1475
00:59:27.769 --> 00:59:28.970
(It'll only be 500kg.)

1476
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.840
- Pardon?
- You should've all gone up.

1477
00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.470
(500kg is too light.)

1478
00:59:34.039 --> 00:59:38.380
- Se Hyeong, you sit there.
- I'll hold on to you guys.

1479
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:40.709
Are you guys ready? Sit down now.

1480
00:59:40.979 --> 00:59:43.010
- Gosh, this is... Is it possible?
- I don't know.

1481
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:46.820
I'm going to have him only do a few
because of you guys on top.

1482
00:59:47.389 --> 00:59:49.289
- About 5?
- I'll have him only do 2 or 3.

1483
00:59:49.289 --> 00:59:52.220
All right. Don't be startled, okay?
Here we go.

1484
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.320
This is actually possible?

1485
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.030
Dae Ho, are you really okay?

1486
00:59:55.329 --> 00:59:56.930
- Hold tight, guys.
- We're ready up here.

1487
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.459
- 1.
- 2, 3.

1488
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.930
- All right. Do it slowly.
- My gosh!

1489
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:04.340
(My gosh!)

1490
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.400
One.

1491
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:08.970
- Two.
- This is unbelievable.

1492
01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:10.510
Let's just do two more.

1493
01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.240
One more.

1494
01:00:12.579 --> 01:00:15.050
Let's do 1 more. Just 1 more.

1495
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:18.119
Okay. All the way up.

1496
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.419
- I can't believe it.
- My gosh.

1497
01:00:21.419 --> 01:00:24.119
(Master, are you really human?)

1498
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.260
- It's really...
- How is this possible?

1499
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.389
I can't believe he lifted me
like that.

1500
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.059
(He sure is the country's
best cleanup hitter.)

1501
01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:33.160
- Hang on.
- My gosh.

1502
01:00:33.769 --> 01:00:35.769
I'm really fascinated.

1503
01:00:35.769 --> 01:00:37.570
(It's really fascinating.)

1504
01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.869
Oh, my. Master, you rock.

1505
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:43.139
- I can't believe he lifted us.
- My gosh.

1506
01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:44.939
- He's a superman.
- Seriously.

1507
01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:48.180
I learned that not everyone
can become an athlete.

1508
01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.450
- Totally.
- Master, you rock.

1509
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.450
- Master, we admire you.
- We admire you.

1510
01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:52.579
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

1511
01:00:53.849 --> 01:00:55.950
- Let's move on to the next one.
- Let's go.

1512
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:57.289
- Okay.
- Let's go over there.

1513
01:00:57.389 --> 01:00:59.660
This is only the beginning.
Let's go. I'll take you guys.

1514
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.160
(The real fight with Chul Soo
begins now.)

1515
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:02.430
(The deadly circuit training)

1516
01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:04.599
Dae Ho will demonstrate
for you guys.

1517
01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:07.599
- Master will show us?
- Yes. Just follow what he does.

1518
01:01:07.669 --> 01:01:09.669
We might be all sore tomorrow.

1519
01:01:09.669 --> 01:01:10.669
(They're getting anxious.)

1520
01:01:10.669 --> 01:01:12.669
He'll warm up first.
Let's do 12 repetitions.

1521
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.610
I'll show you why Dae Ho calls me...

1522
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:17.039
a deadly personal trainer.

1523
01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:18.680
(I'm the deadly Chul Soo.)

1524
01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.309
Ready, go. One.

1525
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:24.180
2. Lower your head. 3, good.

1526
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.019
- Four.
- He's intense.

1527
01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:29.090
5. You need to slow down. 6.
Slower.

1528
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.459
Seven.

1529
01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:33.889
8, 9.

1530
01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:37.130
10. Power up. 10.

1531
01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.160
- 10.
- You're doing this again.

1532
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.970
- 10. Just 3 more.
- How many 10s are there?

1533
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.970
10. We're almost done.

1534
01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:48.410
Just do 1 more. Just 1 more.
Then we're really done.

1535
01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.139
Okay.

1536
01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:52.880
- He did 20.
- Wasn't that 20?

1537
01:01:53.039 --> 01:01:55.610
You could've just told him
to do 20 repetitions.

1538
01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.019
- Then he won't do it.
- If you tell him to do 20?

1539
01:01:58.019 --> 01:01:59.650
He'll never do it.

1540
01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:02.789
But unless he's dumb, if he's been
fooled like this over and over,

1541
01:02:03.189 --> 01:02:06.320
- he should just say he won't do it.
- He shouldn't do it.

1542
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.400
But I'm an athlete, so it's
something I have to do anyway.

1543
01:02:10.499 --> 01:02:12.059
I put up a fight,
but I have to do it.

1544
01:02:12.059 --> 01:02:13.160
(That's why he keeps doing it.)

1545
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.369
All right, this isn't all.
Dae Ho, let's move on to this one.

1546
01:02:16.369 --> 01:02:18.700
- This one is hard too.
- I like doing this.

1547
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.070
I'm noticing that he mainly
works on his back muscles.

1548
01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:24.740
Yes, that's right. Strong back is
crucial for hitting a home run.

1549
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.349
- I see.
- His secret to hitting home runs...

1550
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:29.650
is his back muscles.
Pull your lower back.

1551
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.450
Think that you're paddling
on the Han River.

1552
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.950
- On the Han River?
- Yes, paddling on the Han River.

1553
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.389
- Like this. You're paddling.
- We're in Busan though.

1554
01:02:37.389 --> 01:02:40.220
Good. Use your core. Great.

1555
01:02:40.729 --> 01:02:42.189
Breathe out. Okay.

1556
01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:44.599
All right. Let's do...

1557
01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:47.369
- His muscles...
- 15 repetitions. Just 15.

1558
01:02:47.369 --> 01:02:49.499
- Okay, good. Ready, go.
- You have to do it like this.

1559
01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.769
Nice. Keep going.

1560
01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:52.939
All right, like this.

1561
01:02:53.599 --> 01:02:56.570
Go shorter, shorter.

1562
01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:58.979
Go shorter, shorter.

1563
01:02:58.979 --> 01:03:03.380
- Oh, my.
- Shorter. Okay, good.

1564
01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.519
- Master is already panting.
- Do it like this.

1565
01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:07.050
(No way!)

1566
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:11.260
Ready, go. One. Move your arms more.

1567
01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.260
3. Good. Keep it light. 4.
Lighter. 5.

1568
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.289
Six. Okay, that's good.

1569
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.430
(This is the last workout
in the program.)

1570
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:21.030
- 2, 3.
- He mainly focuses on his back.

1571
01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:22.630
(Another back exercise)

1572
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:24.169
Focus on here. Six.

1573
01:03:24.499 --> 01:03:26.869
Dae Ho is very busy,

1574
01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:29.309
- so he has to finish this quickly.
- Right.

1575
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:31.079
Now, you guys will do it with him.

1576
01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:32.439
Oh, we'll do this one set?

1577
01:03:32.439 --> 01:03:33.680
- Exactly.
- That's one set.

1578
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.410
- You'll be completing one set.
- All right. Then...

1579
01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:37.220
- You, start with number one.
- This?

1580
01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:38.619
You, number two.

1581
01:03:38.979 --> 01:03:40.619
- I see. We'll go around.
- You, number three.

1582
01:03:40.619 --> 01:03:41.820
- Okay.
- Yes.

1583
01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:43.119
You, number four.

1584
01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.360
(Seong Jae is number four.)

1585
01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:45.789
All right. Number five.

1586
01:03:46.519 --> 01:03:48.959
Everyone, get ready.
Start!

1587
01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:51.360
(The deadly circuit training
begins.)

1588
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.559
- I don't know why we're doing this.
- 3, 4.

1589
01:03:53.559 --> 01:03:56.269
- Chul Soo, my legs are all tense.
- 5, 6.

1590
01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.400
(We were definitely in the mountain
just a couple of hours ago.)

1591
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.809
(Now, we're doing this.)

1592
01:04:01.809 --> 01:04:03.169
- Why is time going so slowly?
- Two.

1593
01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:04.910
Three. Good!

1594
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.639
4. Left to right. 5.

1595
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.249
- 6, 7.
- Chul Soo, can we use a stopwatch?

1596
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:11.119
Eight! Okay, good.

1597
01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:13.749
Now, on to the next one. Move.

1598
01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.019
This is intense.

1599
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:16.590
(We only finished one workout.)

1600
01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:17.860
- Is this it?
- Get ready.

1601
01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.119
Start!

1602
01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:20.220
Let's go!

1603
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.689
- This is so wrong.
- 1, 2.

1604
01:04:21.729 --> 01:04:22.930
- Gosh, this is really...
- Three.

1605
01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.499
- I'm so comfortable now.
- Four.

1606
01:04:24.499 --> 01:04:25.860
5, 6.

1607
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.800
Oh, you're doing a good job.
7, 8, 9.

1608
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.539
Move your feet more. 10! That's it.

1609
01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:32.269
(Seong Jae looks so ugly
all of a sudden.)

1610
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:34.470
Pull more. 3, 4.

1611
01:04:34.539 --> 01:04:36.070
- We hiked a few hours ago.
- Five.

1612
01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.939
(Sang Yun is looking ugly too.)

1613
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.180
8, 9!

1614
01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.709
Okay, on to the next one.
Let's move, guys.

1615
01:04:42.709 --> 01:04:44.050
- Where are you going?
- Hurry up.

1616
01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.979
- Hurry.
- Okay.

1617
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:47.919
Get ready. Let's do this.

1618
01:04:47.919 --> 01:04:50.220
- All right.
- Get into your positions, guys.

1619
01:04:50.249 --> 01:04:51.519
Ready, go!

1620
01:04:52.459 --> 01:04:54.689
One. Why are you so stiff?

1621
01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.959
(We feel like we've seen this
just a few minutes ago.)

1622
01:05:01.369 --> 01:05:04.439
(The pain will never end.)

1623
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:09.740
(Is this like the never-ending
Mobius strip?)

1624
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.209
- We're...
- Keep going!

1625
01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:15.550
(Even his name, Chul Soo,
doesn't sound like a real name.)

1626
01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.280
- We hiked this afternoon.
- The last one!

1627
01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:21.619
Okay, good. On to the next one.

1628
01:05:22.689 --> 01:05:24.289
Where do you think you're going?

1629
01:05:24.559 --> 01:05:26.720
- I'll ride the bicycle...
- Come on. Move.

1630
01:05:27.459 --> 01:05:28.990
- This is crazy.
- Get ready.

1631
01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.430
- Start!
- I've never tried this before.

1632
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:34.030
(You're not getting a break.
The 4th workout begins right away.)

1633
01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.869
Good. Five.

1634
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.669
Six. More, more!

1635
01:05:37.669 --> 01:05:38.840
(He's getting noticeably slow.)

1636
01:05:39.999 --> 01:05:42.240
(Chul Soo comes over right away.)

1637
01:05:42.709 --> 01:05:45.939
- 6, 7, 8.
- Chul Soo, I didn't get any sleep.

1638
01:05:45.939 --> 01:05:47.579
- I hiked after a sleepless night.
- Nine.

1639
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.610
- I'm so sleep-deprived...
- Okay.

1640
01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:51.280
On to the next one. Move, move.

1641
01:05:51.479 --> 01:05:53.119
Hurry up, guys. Hurry.

1642
01:05:53.119 --> 01:05:54.249
This is the last one in the set.

1643
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.050
Get ready.

1644
01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.519
Now, start.

1645
01:05:57.519 --> 01:05:59.459
(They'll be completing 1 set
if they finish this.)

1646
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.559
- 3, 4.
- Keep it light.

1647
01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.430
- Gosh.
- 5, 6.

1648
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:05.260
1, 2. Go faster.

1649
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.860
(Sang Yun
can't even do one properly.)

1650
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.229
(Even the youngest one, Seong Jae,
is burnt out.)

1651
01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.970
(But the master is still fine.)

1652
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.410
Done. Good.

1653
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:17.979
Move to the next one
and take a break for a minute.

1654
01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.479
Where are you going?

1655
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.209
Let us take a break
for five minutes.

1656
01:06:21.209 --> 01:06:23.749
(Spaced out)

1657
01:06:23.749 --> 01:06:25.579
I regret coming here today.

1658
01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:27.519
You sweat so much after this.

1659
01:06:27.519 --> 01:06:30.220
(You'll get used to it if you
do this for 4 hours every day.)

1660
01:06:31.919 --> 01:06:33.559
(Beep)

1661
01:06:35.289 --> 01:06:37.200
I don't know why
we're doing this now.

1662
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.800
Okay, let's go.

1663
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.269
- To your positions.
- Chul Soo.

1664
01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:44.400
- Se Hyeong, hurry up.
- Come on, get back here.

1665
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.700
(This master and I
just don't click.)

1666
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.539
Let's say, "We can do this."

1667
01:06:47.539 --> 01:06:49.539
- 1, 2, 3.
- We can do this!

1668
01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:50.910
1, 2, 3!

1669
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:52.939
- No, I can't!
- All right. Get ready now.

1670
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.479
Start!

1671
01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:56.849
- Gosh, this is the easiest one.
- Two.

1672
01:06:57.579 --> 01:06:58.820
- This is the hardest.
- Four.

1673
01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.320
- I'm just going to do this.
- Five.

1674
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.820
(Wake up already!)

1675
01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:04.220
Please don't touch me.

1676
01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.389
(This training will never end.)

1677
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:07.189
10. Keep going.

1678
01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.860
3. Move your arms more! 4.

1679
01:07:09.189 --> 01:07:13.669
4, 4, 4, 4.

1680
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.470
Okay, move to the next one.

1681
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:17.369
Okay!

1682
01:07:17.539 --> 01:07:18.669
Okay!

1683
01:07:18.669 --> 01:07:20.970
All right, let's go. Get ready.

1684
01:07:21.169 --> 01:07:23.209
- Keep breathing.
- Okay!

1685
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:24.639
Ready, go!

1686
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:26.840
Pull all the way. Two.

1687
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:29.110
(Who keeps shouting like that?)

1688
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:32.720
(Shouting)

1689
01:07:39.619 --> 01:07:40.889
- Okay!
- Seven.

1690
01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:45.400
(He's just moving his arms
up and down.)

1691
01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:47.930
(Chul Soo caught him.)

1692
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.200
What are you doing now?

1693
01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.039
- 2, 3.
- Okay!

1694
01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.840
Four.

1695
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.939
(ㅜNow, Chul Soo will watch him
right beside him.)

1696
01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:59.039
- Okay!
- 7, 8.

1697
01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:00.749
Nine. And the last one!

1698
01:08:00.749 --> 01:08:01.950
(The master isn't
distracted at all.)

1699
01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:07.119
(These guys never forget to say
"okay" at the end of each workout.)

1700
01:08:07.119 --> 01:08:08.119
Okay!

1701
01:08:08.119 --> 01:08:10.050
Okay. One more, guys. You can do it.

1702
01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:11.519
- Okay, okay!
- 1, 2, 3.

1703
01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.289
I'll keep an eye on you
from right here.

1704
01:08:14.289 --> 01:08:16.360
- I'll look at you too.
- Okay, get ready!

1705
01:08:16.559 --> 01:08:17.760
Start!

1706
01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.369
1, 2, 3.

1707
01:08:20.769 --> 01:08:22.499
4. Keep going. 5.

1708
01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:24.439
(Chul Soo left.)

1709
01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:25.740
Do it again. Eight!

1710
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:28.139
(He quietly puts it down.)

1711
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:37.150
(He makes sure he looks
and sounds like he's doing it.)

1712
01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:42.049
Chul Soo, look at Se Hyeong.

1713
01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.089
Look at Se Hyeong.

1714
01:08:44.089 --> 01:08:45.559
(He starts doing it again.)

1715
01:08:45.559 --> 01:08:47.589
- Move. On to the next one.
- Okay!

1716
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:49.689
Doing this with them is hard
because it takes longer.

1717
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:51.129
All right, guys.

1718
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:52.599
Ready, go!

1719
01:08:52.759 --> 01:08:55.200
1, 2, 3.

1720
01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.469
Nice, that's good! Four.

1721
01:08:56.469 --> 01:08:58.740
(He has to move only his arms,)

1722
01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:01.240
(but he's using his entire body.)

1723
01:09:03.469 --> 01:09:06.379
(Grumbling)

1724
01:09:06.379 --> 01:09:08.410
(They can't focus on the workout
because of Se Hyeong.)

1725
01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:09.549
Okay!

1726
01:09:09.549 --> 01:09:11.719
(Grumbling)

1727
01:09:11.719 --> 01:09:14.490
(Swearing)

1728
01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.120
Don't swear.

1729
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.559
- Okay!
- He's hilarious.

1730
01:09:17.559 --> 01:09:18.790
(I don't care even if
this will be on TV.)

1731
01:09:19.059 --> 01:09:21.229
- He was swearing.
- We're shooting a show.

1732
01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.660
All right, guys. I'm sorry,
but you have to do one more set.

1733
01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.299
- No more.
- There's one more set.

1734
01:09:27.299 --> 01:09:30.229
- No more!
- Even you look exhausted.

1735
01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.870
Master, are you okay?

1736
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:33.400
I'm exhausted. I wouldn't do it
if it wasn't exhausting.

1737
01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:35.710
- The harder it is, the better.
- But it's...

1738
01:09:36.469 --> 01:09:38.080
Don't heavyweight boxers
work out like this?

1739
01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:40.009
This is...

1740
01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.280
(We don't even have any energy
to laugh.)

1741
01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.450
- Let's go.
- All right.

1742
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:43.950
Master in the House in 2018.

1743
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:45.250
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1744
01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:46.620
(Let's go!)

1745
01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.150
- We can do this. Okay!
- Okay!

1746
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.320
- All right, guys. Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1747
01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.860
Ready, go!

1748
01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.990
(The 3rd set begins.)

1749
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.429
(This boring guy is here
to really work out.)

1750
01:09:57.429 --> 01:09:58.830
Shake them more. More!

1751
01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:00.469
(Seung Gi looks crazy.)

1752
01:10:00.469 --> 01:10:02.129
More. Bigger, bigger!

1753
01:10:02.129 --> 01:10:03.429
(I must focus.)

1754
01:10:03.429 --> 01:10:04.799
Okay, move to the next one.

1755
01:10:05.269 --> 01:10:06.670
Let's go. Let's do this.

1756
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.870
Hurry up.

1757
01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.210
- Hey.
- Where on earth are you going now?

1758
01:10:10.379 --> 01:10:12.179
- Where do you think you're going?
- You're doing that one.

1759
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.250
Let's go. Get ready.

1760
01:10:18.479 --> 01:10:19.979
(He's at it again.)

1761
01:10:19.979 --> 01:10:21.790
Okay. Ready, go!

1762
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:24.589
- Okay, go!
- 1, 2.

1763
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.920
- 3, 4.
- My gosh!

1764
01:10:27.589 --> 01:10:29.929
(Only good people can see it.)

1765
01:10:29.929 --> 01:10:31.400
- Bigger.
- Let's keep going!

1766
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.429
(Se Hyeong kills me.)

1767
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:34.769
(He acts like he's
having such a hard time.)

1768
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.240
(The master is trying
not to crack up.)

1769
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.400
Chul Soo, Chul Soo.

1770
01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:42.540
(Look at Se Hyeong.)

1771
01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.410
What on earth are you doing now?

1772
01:10:45.939 --> 01:10:47.650
- Okay, on to the next one.
- Okay!

1773
01:10:47.809 --> 01:10:49.049
- Okay.
- Okay!

1774
01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:51.620
- Okay!
- Where are you going?

1775
01:10:51.719 --> 01:10:52.979
Hey, come here.

1776
01:10:53.479 --> 01:10:55.019
- Get back here.
- All right, the next one.

1777
01:10:55.019 --> 01:10:56.250
Get back here.

1778
01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:57.620
- Come here.
- He kills me.

1779
01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960
- Do it faster, will you?
- All right.

1780
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.189
You guys are dragging it out.

1781
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:05.460
If anyone tries to cheat,
you'll have to do another set.

1782
01:11:06.799 --> 01:11:08.799
- One more set.
- I've been working out nonstop.

1783
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:11.740
- I'm doing it too.
- Gosh, what was that about?

1784
01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.469
Who was it? Whoever is it
will get in trouble.

1785
01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:14.839
Get ready. Keep it up, guys.

1786
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:18.080
Let's do this. Ready, go!

1787
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.349
(The training resumes,
and it gets more intense.)

1788
01:11:21.509 --> 01:11:22.780
Three.

1789
01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:26.179
(The tiger puts on a spurt.)

1790
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:30.320
(This one is forced into doing it
because of Chul Soo.)

1791
01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.830
(He's working out with his face.)

1792
01:11:33.929 --> 01:11:35.759
You guys are doing a good job. One!

1793
01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:43.500
(Everyone looks ugly now.)

1794
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.070
Good, stop. Move to the next one.

1795
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:47.809
- Okay!
- Hurry up. Faster.

1796
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:49.939
- Get ready.
- This is the last episode, right?

1797
01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.509
- This better be the last one.
- I want to poop.

1798
01:11:51.509 --> 01:11:53.410
Okay, get ready. Ready.

1799
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.580
- I'm...
- Let's go. Let's do this.

1800
01:11:57.349 --> 01:11:58.780
Hang in there, okay?

1801
01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.820
Ready, go!

1802
01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:03.689
Two.

1803
01:12:05.059 --> 01:12:06.189
Keep your head up.

1804
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:08.129
(Seong Jae is
laughing on the floor.)

1805
01:12:10.929 --> 01:12:13.200
What on earth are you doing now?
Give me that.

1806
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.500
(Are you trying to provoke me?)

1807
01:12:15.269 --> 01:12:16.429
Flex your back.

1808
01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:20.639
(Thanks to Se Hyeong, they can
laugh even though they're in pain.)

1809
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:24.410
3, 4.

1810
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:27.009
Keep going! Five and the last one!

1811
01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:29.280
- Gosh!
- Done.

1812
01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:34.620
- Se Hyeong is hilarious.
- All right.

1813
01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.120
This is really the last one.

1814
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:38.290
- This is the last one. Keep it up.
- Gosh, Se Hyeong kills me.

1815
01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:39.559
All right, guys.

1816
01:12:41.389 --> 01:12:42.660
Gosh, why do I have to do this?

1817
01:12:44.299 --> 01:12:45.830
Even if I'm born again,

1818
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.500
I'll become a singer.

1819
01:12:49.429 --> 01:12:51.799
I don't think I'll ever be able
to become a baseball player.

1820
01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:54.040
Power up, guys.

1821
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.309
This is the last set.

1822
01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.080
Okay, let's do this.

1823
01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.110
Ready, go!

1824
01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:00.479
(They use all the energy
they have left.)

1825
01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.650
(Fast forward)

1826
01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:07.990
That's it. 1, 2.

1827
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:10.620
Go bigger! 3, 4.

1828
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:13.219
5, 6, 7.

1829
01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:16.629
8, 9, 10.

1830
01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.660
(He's about to breakdown.)

1831
01:13:20.469 --> 01:13:23.900
(His mentality is logged out.)

1832
01:13:25.339 --> 01:13:27.710
(Other people would think
his shoulder's dislocated.)

1833
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:30.269
It's gotten harder.

1834
01:13:32.979 --> 01:13:34.309
My stomach hurts even more.

1835
01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:35.349
(My stomach hurts more
from laughing.)

1836
01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:36.849
I know you're trying to avoid it.

1837
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:41.250
- Everyone's smiling.
- Pardon?

1838
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.589
You should smile, Se Hyeong.

1839
01:13:43.049 --> 01:13:44.920
(He suddenly smiles.)

1840
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.129
If you frown, I'll make you do
three more sets.

1841
01:13:47.129 --> 01:13:48.259
Good. Everyone's smiling.

1842
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:50.089
Good. Keep smiling.

1843
01:13:50.089 --> 01:13:51.099
(Oh, I'm very happy.)

1844
01:13:51.099 --> 01:13:52.729
- I'm so happy today.
- Good.

1845
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:55.229
- It benefits you.
- Yes.

1846
01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:57.000
Are we done exercising?

1847
01:13:57.299 --> 01:14:00.299
Shall we do
what Lee Dae Ho's good at?

1848
01:14:00.299 --> 01:14:01.540
(Shall we try
what the master's good at?)

1849
01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.210
(Are we...)

1850
01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:04.910
(going to...)

1851
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:06.479
(exercise again?)

1852
01:14:07.179 --> 01:14:08.650
You two can go ahead.

1853
01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.150
We'll stay here and wrap up.

1854
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:14.420
- How about two more sets?
- Okay. Move.

1855
01:14:15.089 --> 01:14:16.250
Move.

1856
01:14:16.549 --> 01:14:18.960
- Let's go.
- It's hard being an athlete.

1857
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960
You exercise so much every day.

1858
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:22.059
(Extreme training master
called the king)

1859
01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:24.200
("Along with the Gods")

1860
01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.429
(Agony of monstrous power)

1861
01:14:26.429 --> 01:14:28.629
(Agony of sleeplessness)

1862
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:31.139
(Agony of empty stomach)

1863
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:33.469
(Saviors are coming to rescue them.)

1864
01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.040
(Lee Ye Seung, Lee Hyo Rin)

1865
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:36.910
(Capture their hearts...)

1866
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:38.479
(to target the master daddy.)

1867
01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:40.549
(My service to you, savior.)

1868
01:14:40.549 --> 01:14:41.849
(He ignores.)

1869
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:43.849
(Shocking truth continues.)

1870
01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.019
(Saviors are sensitive
than they thought.)

1871
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:49.290
(In the end,)

1872
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:51.219
(the king's furious.)

1873
01:14:51.219 --> 01:14:53.290
(The door to the agony shall open.)

1874
01:14:53.389 --> 01:14:56.490
(Fight holding the door of agony.)

1875
01:14:59.099 --> 01:15:00.330
Start.

1876
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:07.769
(Master in the House along
with the king is coming soon.)
