How did you know Moon Soo likes a woman who eats carrots?

13
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.740
Are those carrots?

14
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.080
Yeah. When she sees a man who eats carrots or beans, she stares at him without shame.

15
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.760
I do?

16
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.520
But isn't it nice?

17
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.630
What's so good about it?

18
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.320
It's good for your body.

19
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.860
He wouldn't be picky about food. Don't you think he'd have a great personality?

20
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.790
You like beans, too, right?

21
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.750
Yeah.

22
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.780
See?

23
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.670
He can't eat chicken feet nor soju.

24
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.000
But she says he's not picky.

25
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.850
Did you see that?

26
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.440
Love... Love turns people to become so biased.

27
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.120
Drink.

28
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.430
But why is that Hyung even here?

29
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.180
To someone who doesn't know darkness, there's no light for him either.

30
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.610
Live conquering darkness.

31
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.320
Then you'd be able to see the light.

32
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.460
This is a true teacher.

33
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.290
Why are you out here?

34
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.930
Let's go together up to there.

35
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.350
It's pretty.

36
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.230
You go first.

37
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.520
I don't ever see a snowman even when it snows.

38
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.240
Do you remember when was the last time you mad a snowman?

39
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.090
Um... When I was in elementary school?

40
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.110
Me, too. That was the last time for me, too.

41
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.580
Should we make one?

42
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.320
When did you come and make all this?

43
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.430
I only warmed things up. Your husband is a great cook.

44
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.330
Older Sis... Eat.

45
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.760
She said she's sleeping over at her cartoonist friend and going to work straight.

46
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.430
I have to hurry up and go down. Your husband is watching the ticketing box.

47
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.300
Come down after you eat everything.

48
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.110

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.510

51
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.300
<i>Hold me.</i>

52
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.530
Joo Won.

53
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.710
Sleep more. I'll go first.

54
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.770
Thanks.

55
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.190
Goodbye.

56
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.250
You came early.

57
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.580
Hello.

58
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.790
CEO!

59
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.180
You two are both wearing the same thing as yesterday.

60
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.890
You must've slept out.

61
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.950
Let's go inside.

62
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.020
- I slept at a friend's house...
- As for you, I don't care whether you sleep over at your friend's house or sleep with Gang Doo.

63
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.650
I wonder where the CEO slept at.

64
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.760
Did you see how wrinkled his shirt was?

65
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.250
He's not like that.

66
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.930
Could it be Director Jeong? It wouldn't be, right?

67
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.740
<i>Thanks.</i>

68
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.380
<i>Goodbye.</i>

69
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.500
Unnie, the landscape design team is asking you to send over the memorial sample. They're starting on their design.

70
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.440
That will determine whether they'll use stepping stone or blocks for the pavement.

71
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.280
Okay.

72
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:41.750
Hey, Gang Doo, the Moksan Environment is sending more workers at 11 am for the dismantling work.

73
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.290
Check the number of workers and manage well when the company leaves.

74
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.460
You said it's all the wreck from the time when the shopping mall collapsed.

75
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.360
Is it okay to take care of all that like it's waste?

76
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.670
When you think about it, it's same as the waste that you create when you demolish buildings.

77
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.680
The waste management company will take care of it anyway. We don't have to concern ourselves.

78
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.530
It's the same?

79
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.720
- But we should still confirm.
- We did. Your CEO did.

80
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.520
- CEO Seo?
- Yeah.

81
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.090
I felt uneasy, so I mentioned it to him.

82
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:16.270
He came by himself and checked. And he told me to manage it as waste.

83

85
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.290
Why do you keep sighing?

86
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.140
I did?

87
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.700
Yeah.

88
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.890
Did you make a mistake yesterday?

89
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.010
You wore underwear that don't match.

90
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.150
It's nothing like that.

91
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.710
I told you I slept over at a friend's house.

92
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.960
See? Unnie.

93
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.950
It's no use now matter how hard you try to forget.

94
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.050
The things you really want to forget about... You remember them forever.

95
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.840
It's not something I want to forget.

96
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.030
I'm afraid that I'd forget.

97
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.980
I'm going offsite.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.690
I'm sorry.

101
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.600
- Excuse me...
- I'm not buying.

102
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.700
It's not that. Is this Seong Jae oppa's...

Choi  Seong Jae...

104

Seong Jae isn't here right now.

105
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.200
Sorry?

106
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.100
He's not home right now.

107
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.800
What are you doing and not getting ready? Why was your phone off?!

108
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.400
Don't you know there's a Board of Directors meeting at 3 p.m.?

109
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.300
I know, get out.

110
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.000
Get out? Hurry up and get ready.

111

<i>Room service.</i>

113
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.500
I didn't order.

114
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.100
The man who left early this morning asked us to bring you this around this time.

115
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.580
Wow, wow, look at you. Who were you with all night?

116
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.200
The guy from yesterday, did you already...

117
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.400
Are you crazy?

118
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.300
Then who is it?

119
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.800
By chance... Seo Joo Won... It's not him, right?

120
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.000
- Get out.
- Hey, hey.

121
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.200
You're not that bad in making wise determinations, are you?

122
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.200
Hurry up and come out!

123
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.000
I need an application for the construction to submit to the Sinsudong City Hall.

124
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.600
Why don't we rework the piping behind the soundproof walls?

125
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.600
If we connect the sewage and sewage piping, foul odor can occur.

126
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.200
Check the ventilation piping in the first floor restroom again.

127
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.400
I'm sorry.

128
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.000
I know there's too much work and not enough time.

129
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.800
But if you miss the details, everything will be ruined.

130
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.900
You don't become an architect simply because you can draw pictures.

131
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.250
Do you have the construction design yet?

132
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.400
No, not yet.

133
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.200
With the change in the lot, the schedule has moved up. Let's rush.

134
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.300
It's also our job to keep our deadline that's been determined.

135
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.600
Okay.

136
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.800
"You don't become an architect simply because you can draw pictures."

137
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.600
Oh, he's so cool!

138
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.600
I mean, it's good for me, but...

139
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.600
Why isn't it not the CEO and Gang Doo oppa?

140
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.100
I mean, why exactly do you like Kang Doo?

141
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.700
Nothing specific, right? I can tell you right away why I like our CEO.

142
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.900
No, it's because theres too many.

143
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.100
Then, just tell me one.

144
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.000
I do like him.

145
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.800
There's no reason I don't like Gang Doo.

146
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.000
You scared me!

147
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.900
You thought I didn't see you, didn't you? When did you get here?

148
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.100
Just a bit ago.

149
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.000
You should've called.

150
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I was about to but then you came out.

151
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.900
Let's go.

152
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.400
I became rich.

153
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.800
Aren't you cold? I said let's go inside.

154
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.100
I like the cold in the winter.

155
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.200
It's warm.

156
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.860
I went to a bereaved family member's house today.

157
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.470
Alone?

158
00:17:38.494 --> 00:17:39.994
Yeah.

159
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:47.400
I went by myself but I just came right back.

160
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.100

322
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.520
Unnie, your password...

323
00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.910
Oh, I changed it.

324
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.690
Why?

325
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:34.370
It means we've reached a point where you can't just mindlessly let yourself in anymore.

326
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.050
You asked me to stop you.

327
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.630
It's because of you!

328
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.690
No, I guess I should say it's thanks to you?

329
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.800
The other day! The day when Gang Doo was carrying you on his back.

330
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.520
I had a terrible stomachache from my ulcer for eating chicken feet.

331
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.890
You fall for someone easily when you get sick.

332
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.030
When would I ever win a lotto like that in my life?

333
00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.450
Hey, I didn't lure him first.

334
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.770
I did somewhat show off that I own a building.

335
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.430
Geez...

336
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.590
As if Jin Yeong would fall for something like that...

337
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.590
Right?

338
00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.060
By the way, what brings you here so early in the morning? Aren't you going to work?

339
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.370
Yeah. I have a favor to ask of you.

340
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:27.430
This is your father's plantation in Gangwon-do, right?

341
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.200
Yeah, that's right.

342
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.320
Then can I go there?

343
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.880
I want to get some trees.

344
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.910
Of course you can go.

345
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:41.390
The gardeners for rich homes in Korea take our wood.

346
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.160
But what do you need trees for?

347
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.500
It's because of the memorial park.

348
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.520
The landscape design team says it's hard for them to get big trees.

349
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.570
The job you were given was doing the memorial park?

350
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.810
Yeah.

351
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:03.330
You're really something and your CEO is also something else.

352
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:07.190
He's making you do that even though he knows you were a victim in that accident?

353
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.790
It's because he knows.

354
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:13.750
- I'm a victim so I can do it bett...
- Survivor.

355
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.520
She's not a victim; she's a survivor.

356
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.140
What's the difference?

357
00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.590
That she's still alive of course.

358
00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.470
That's something really amazing.

The house you visited yesterday

365
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.680
was this house?

Please contact me.

Seong Jae Oppa?

377
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.800
Before,

378
00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:04.510
do you remember me telling you that I was with someone other than my sister?

379

381

Because of me he couldn't even grow into an adult.

382

Let's go.

383

What is it?

384
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.550
No. It's nothing.

385
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.440
Let's go.

386

Who...?

388
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:14.410
We've seen each other before, haven't we?

389
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.730
Who...?

390
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.900
Looks like you know that you did something wrong. Seeing as you didn't try to block it.

391
00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:37.400
They say I should yank your hair at a time like this. What a hassle. Why bother?

392
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.690
Let's talk outside.

393
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.410
You've been here, too. I guess you didn't know that I'm the owner.

394
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.330
I built this one for my husband so he can enjoy his hobby.

395
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:13.930
Even though we're not a husband and wife with a good relationship,

396
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:17.030
I couldn't just let this slide.

397
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:22.650
Are you dating my husband?

398
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.630
If you are, then stop now.

399
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:36.980
Father's health is poor. So, it won't benefit my husband at all if he gets on my father's bad side.

400
00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.520
We're not dating, but I'll do that.

401
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.730
I'm a bar owner, the director is my client. As for me...

402
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:52.460
I smile for him as much as I get paid. If the deal is over, our relationship is over.

403
00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.820
There's nothing you need to worry about, Madame.

404
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.870
You're very smart. Discomfortingly so.

405
00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:02.670
Please don't be uneasy. I'll never

406
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.970
be able to be as dignified as you.

412
00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.020
Go and take a look.

413
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.570
Pardon?

414
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.630
Ah, o-okay...

415
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.110
But, um, shouldn't we tell the police...?

416
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.970
Police, my butt!

417
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.130
Some crazy punk must have just slaughtered a dog or something here.

418
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:52.580
You can probably tell just by looking, but it's too big for a dog bone?

419
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.210
Well? It's nothing so hurry back to your work.

420
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:02.600
What are you doing? It's no big deal so hurry up and go. You want to spend the night here?

421
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.350
What are you doing? It's nothing special so what do you need to take a picture for!

422
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.030
What?

423
00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.850
I'm gonna go nuts. For god's sake!

424
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.380
I got it.

425
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.490
- Go to the work-site.
- Yes, sir.

426
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.440
- CEO?
- Yes?

427
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.080
I think you need to go in person.

428
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.880
We have a meeting with the measurement company. I should review everything before then...

429
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:50.380
The Chief is also saying that you absolutely need to come. It looks like a problem came up on the site.

430
00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:56.320
If it's not something that's going to get resolved right away by me being there, let's do this first.

431
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.210
B-But even so...

432
00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:01.350
Control of the work-site is the Chief's job.

433
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.790
I'm responsible for design related problems.

434
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:10.030
Anything other than that, they should be able to make a decision about themselves.

435
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.130
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

436
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.690
<i>I'm taking a video of it.</i>

437
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.370
What is it? What the hell is it!

438
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.400
Bring it to me.

439
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:55.930
Can you tell what that is by looking at it?

440
00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:59.220
Is an animal corpse showing up on site a several day work affair!

441
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.370
Why are you creating problems for no reason!

442
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:05.800
Ugh, ugh...

443
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.830
What'd you get scared for? Did you think it was a person?

444
00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:23.710
CEO Seo is the construction supervisor so he should make a decision about it when he's here.

445
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.170
That way the allocation of responsibility later will be clear too.

446
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:34.670
Why on earth were you assigned here? Can't you just make a living for yourself now?

447
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.090
I have to work to make a living for myself.

448
00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:43.370
Then do your job only. Don't make situations worse. It's 2018.

449
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:50.740
It's 2018! How much longer will you dwell on something that happened more than 10 years ago?

450
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:02.980
After the design has been changed to put the memorial park in the VIP parking lot area...

451
00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:07.820
I think it will be unavoidable to change the B area left side road near the Silver Town.

452
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:20.030
Do you remember what you told me before?

453
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.520
<i>You said they didn't properly handle the aftermath and just covered everything up, right?</i>

454
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.220
<i>There were a lot of bodies discovered then that weren't in one piece. Aren't they still lying buried there?</i>

455
00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.200
<i>If you find it unfair, then find and bring evidence for it.</i>

456
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:39.080
- Did you see the video I sent you?
- Yes.

457
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.400
The site chief said that as the supervisor this is a matter that needs to be brought to you for a decision.

458
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.860
So that they can put me in the forefront when they need someone to take the blame.

459
00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.100
My father as well...

460
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.530
I heard from Department Head Jeong.

461
00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:02.220
That your father was also an architect. Architect Seo Ji Oh.

462
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:10.050
So I'm going to believe in you. That you won't make the same mistake.

463
00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:13.290
This isn't something that I can make a decision on by myself.

464
00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:18.670
Let's say we eat the loss when we stop the construction. But how about the subcontractors who are depending on this construction site work?

465
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.020
So what?

466
00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:25.800
So it's something that needs to be decided after discussing with the head office. All you need to do,

467
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.610
- is check how the work on site is going.
- Even without you telling me to,

468
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.260
I'm going to do that because it's what I should do.

469
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:35.130
But I feel like making sure you all don't do things you shouldn't do,

470
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:40.150
is more important than doing what I should be doing.

471
00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.000
What do you want?

472
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:07.020
I'm tired. If you came to nag at me too, I'm going to pass on it today.

473
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:11.490
I heard about the work-site. What are you going to do about it?

474
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:16.090
I entrusted it with someone to check if it's a human's or animal's so we have to wait for the results to come out.

475
00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.960
Why does our side need to look that up? If it becomes a problem then so what?

476
00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.200
Seo Joo Won even agreed to it so why are you being like this?

477
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.520
Joo Won did?

478
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.800
He's the supervisor, isn't he?

479
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:32.060
Who's the one who drove out my father-in-law from the supervisory position? He should be responsible!

480
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:45.230
- Did you open up Gate 4?
- Yeah.

481
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:48.820
Close it back up. There's no night shift tonight.

482
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:54.520
There aren't too many construction sites that are in operation during wintertime. It's bad.

483
00:53:55.890 --> 00:54:01.340
If even our side is stopped from working, then all those people aren't going to have a place to go. Goodness.

484
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.150

One moment please.

487
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.240
I could've met with you in any old place you know.

488
00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:41.220
This is any old place to me. What was the reason for you to reach out to me to meet up?

489
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.350
Do me a favor.

490
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:44.580
What favor?

491
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:49.300
The CEO Seo that I know isn't someone that puts off decisions.

492
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.630
But in the end, he never came to the work-site today.

493
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:56.060
Then it must not have been an important enough matter for him to come to the work-site.

494
00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:01.900
It's not just any other construction site. There are people who never came out of that accident.

495
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.200
Be that as it may, I doubt that's something for you to get involved in.

496
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:11.740
Why do you think CEO Seo sent me to work on site?

497
00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.100
To be a spy?

498
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:17.670
Well, I thought that too.

499
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.600
But turns out not.

500
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.150
I think it was because he was uneasy.

501
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.490
Someone like me who doesn't know any better... He needed someone like that to make issue out of every single thing.

502
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:33.670
So that he can do a double take over things that are easily overlooked.

503
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:41.500
The deadline is tight, the workers have nowhere to go. I think CEO Seo is cornered and is a bit confused.

504
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:45.870
Even if it's a dog bone, let's confirm before we move on.

505
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.800
If there are problems, CEO Seo will take all the blame.

506
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.770
You're too much.

507
00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:54.820

Tastes good.

509
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.740
The vibe here is good too. I'll have to bring Moon Soo here.

510
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.510
This place only serves members you know. You pay for today.

511
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:15.990
Shouldn't the person with a lot of money be treating?

512
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:17.620
What do you do with the money you got from selling the land?

513
00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.630
That's not my money. I have to spend on something else.

514
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:57.520
A report?

515
00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.040
The police forensic team will come out and retrieve the bones.

516
00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.420
Why would you do that?

517
00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:06.720
I can't let you be responsible for something you didn't do.

518
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.400
If you cover up and issues arise, the blame falls on the site manager

519
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.260
and you as the supervisor.

520
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:18.220
If so, I'm sure the site manager will get himself out of it somehow.

521
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.660
There's one missing person from the shopping mall collapse accident.

522
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:27.910
As long as we get the DNA test result, the construction can restart in a week.

523
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:32.530
It won't be a huge issue. So, don't waver.

524
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.380
From the company's perspective, this is a cleaner way to deal with it.

525
00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:42.240
If he's found to be the missing person, our motive behind the memorial park would become more clear.

526
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.860
This is as far as I'll go. You handle the rest.

527

They still don't know yet.

Seriously, what's with you all today? Is this the first time this has happened to me or something?

If I hadn't stopped that truck...

582
01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:00.380
Come on now. It's the truck's fault for leaving without properly tying it down with a rope first!

583
