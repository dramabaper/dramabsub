Did you sleep well?

21
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.600
Why didn't you leave?

22
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.500
Because I didn't want you to be alone

23
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.700
when you wake up.

24
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.680
I should go.

25
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.500
Sleep a bit more. I could take the first bus.

26
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.400
Thank you.

27
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.660
For not leaving,

28
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.200
Thanks a lot.

29
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.100
As long as you're not mean,

30
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.600
I could stay with you whenever (you wish).

<i>A person uses about ten facial muscles when you smile.</i>

<i>Rather than frowning with such a strain, I wish you all a day filled with bright smiles.</i>

<i>Suffering, resentment, and regrets</i>

38
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.400

<i>the ugly and scary life.</i>

42
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.880
Somehow...

43
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.730
That's like Grandma.

44
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.800
- CEO.
- Yes.

45
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.700
You're early.

46
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.200
It's good. It's good by isn't too accessible?

47
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.200
Some people who doesn't want others to notice how they feel.

48
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.700
That's true but this is a place

49
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.990
people could cry to their hearts content not caring about how others may view them.

50
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.210
I wish they could just mourn here.

51
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.200
<i>- Ahjussi...
- Move!</i>

52
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.200
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. It was my mistake.</i>

53
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.300
<i>Why did you have to make a mistake!</i>

54
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.000
<i>Why then? Of all days!</i>

55
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.100
<i>Why did you have to make such a stupid mistake!</i>

56
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.400
Just being sad all the time... Is that possible?

57
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.390
What?

58
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.400
"Victims are all filled with sadness."

59
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.600
"Poor people are always more kind. The disabled people are always weak."

60
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.400
Aren't all those things bias?

61
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.600
Poor people can be greedy and disabled people can be frauds.

62
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.000
Victims can also be perpetrators.

63
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
CEO.

64
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.800
The people who'd visit the memorial park the most...

65
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.500
Another word, these are people who'd be living around there.

66
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.800
It's not that I don't know where you're coming from.

67
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.000
But right now, you're an architectural designer rather than a victim.

68
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.300
Don't forget that.

69
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.300
I'm sorry. I had told you I'd let you be in charge and I talked too much.

70
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.600
The contractual amount will be deposited today right away, right?

71
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.500
I will. So that you won't be able to say anything else.

72
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.200
I had nothing to hold in my hands no matter how hard I worked.

73
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.000
You were making money so easily like this.

74
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.200
Hey! Do you know how much we're losing out as we're signing the contract?

75
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.400
Should we figure out how much you are losing out?

76
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.000
Stop it and let's end it here. It's not like you're not going to sign the contract.

77
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.100
I can go out to the construction site starting next week, right?

78
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.800
After I speak with the construction site manager.

79
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.100
Geez... Tell him not to be too tough with me.

80
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.600
Please put in a good word for me.

81
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:15.040
That a**hole... Even if he's got nothing, how could he not have any manners at all?

82
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.200
Lee Gang Doo.

83
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.400
What? Is there anything else?

84
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.600
Were you very close to the deceased?

85
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.100
Why?

86
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.000
What kind of relationship did you two have that she'd leave you land? I was just curious.

87
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.400
From your perspective where family members measure and compete with each other...

88
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.000
I guess it'd be a difficult relationship for you to understand.

89
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.800
What are you going to do from now on?

90
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.600
Does Ha Moon Soo also know that you'd be coming out to the construction site again?

91
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.000
I'll tell her first.

92
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.400
Why do you look like that? You told me not to run away.

93
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.900
Ha Moon Soo must be happy. I'm envious.

94
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.600
I'll go head on. So, whether you'll retreat or move forward...

95
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.000
You decide well.

96
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
He doesn't budge at all. What can I do alone?

97
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.200
Then let go of him.

98
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.980
If you don't even have the courage to let go, you should run away.

99
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.800
I have nowhere to run to.

100
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800
What do you mean you don't.

101
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.000
If people found out someone like you'd hang onto a man like that, they'd talking crap about you.

102
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.600
Wake up and smell the coffee.

103
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.200
Thanks for helping me with contract condition changes.

104
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.900
I've figured out everything and did what I did because it was worth it. Don't misunderstand me.

105
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.500
Oh, hey...

106
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.080
Hey, Gang Doo!

107
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.010
Hey, drink this.

108
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.890
The site manager... He couldn't even eat lunch and got called at the headquarters.

109
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.860
He got so angry when he heard you were coming. Of course, I'm happy.

110
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.280
Were you all right while I was gone?

111
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.390
Aigoo, don't even mention it.

112
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.620
Because your CEO threw a fit, we had to conduct the subsurface exploration all over again.

113
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.440
Because all we did was get rid of the waste...

114
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.890
"Where am I? Who am I?" I had an identity conflict.

115
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.100
So, I waited for you so much.

116
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.170
For me?

117
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.370
Yeah. I was scared by myself.

118
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.370
Why?

119
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.540
There's a strange rumor.

120
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.650
What rumor?

121
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.980
People keep seeing strange things.

122
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.900
You know, right? This is where a huge accident took place.

123
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:01.040
At that time, I heard they buried everything trying to take care of things in a hurry.

124
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.190
They didn't even retrieve the bodies properly.

125
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.860
Whenever I work the nightshift, the hair on my back kept standing up.

126
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.280
<i>What are you doing?</i>

127
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.410
<i>I said help me.</i>

128
00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.230
<i>Hey!</i>

129
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.020
<i>Hey, me too! Me, too.</i>

130
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.640
<i>There are people down here!</i>

131
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.230
What's wrong with you? Are you all right?

132
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.140
- Ugh...
- Aigoo...

133
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.120
What's that? Hey, there!

134
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.430
Be careful! Be careful!

135
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.550
<i>Victims can also be perpetrators.</i>

136
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.550

137
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:46.580
<i>But right now, you're an architectural designer rather than a victim. Don't forget that.</i>

138
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.750
<i>Hi.</i>

139
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.250
Hi.

140
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.670
<i>Hello?</i>

141
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.970
Hi. What?

142
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.000
What do you mean what? You called me.

143
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.790
<i>Ah... right. Did you eat?</i>

144
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.250
I don't feel like eating. And you?

145
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.480
Me neither. I kind of ate.

146
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.250
<i>Why did you "kind of" eat? You should eat well.</i>

147
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.840
Are you off work?

148
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:57.720
Yeah. How about you? What did you do today?

149
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.490
Just... I took a walk.

150
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.200
<i>To where?</i>

151
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.780
Just... here and there.

152
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.830
Walking around like that...

153
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.630
I realized I was thinking about you.

154
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.900
I miss you.

155
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.700
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

156
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.490

Hey, let's go inside. It's cold.

213
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.750
I told you not to disturb me.

214

What is it?

215
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.390
What are you doing with the girls during my peak hours?

216
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.300
I can pay for them.

217
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.880
You're not even playing with them. You'll be wasting your money and we'll lose out on business.

218
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.010
What must we do that?

219
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.300
I have to do this, so that you'd see me.

220
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.430
You left like that and won't even answer my calls.

221
00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:03.160
If you feel bad toward me, apologize. I'll accept it.

222
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.580
I can't. That's why I'm doing this.

223
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.820
It's comfortable for me when I take care of things with money. This is the only way I know how!

224
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:29.500
You must have no affection for me whatsoever.

225
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.860
I know, too. There aren't many people who like me.

226
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.120
You do?

227
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:44.700
I do. People bow down to me in front of me, but talk crap about me behind my back.

228
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.650
Don't you think I know that?

229
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.500
It's a relief if you know. But don't worry about it.

230
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.250
Even if they do, they're all under you. That's why they're talking crap about you.

231
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.360
I know that, too.

232

I signed the contract today. Lee Gang Doo.

233
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.210
Why is that a**hole so confident?

234
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.450
If we signed the contract, he should be grateful to me! But he's not grateful to me at all! Geez!

235
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:34.150
Right. You should smile. You're pretty that way.

236
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.840
Why? Do I look more like your first love when I smile?

237
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.340
You do.

238
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.570
Well, that's not why I like you.

239
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.740
She was a real b****.

240
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.480
At least, you don't bulls*** about love this and that.

241

I like that clarity about you.

Hyung, what are you doing?

244
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.040
I heard the ahjussi in #201 found it somewhere.

245
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.100
I thought I was going to die trying to hang it up.

246
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.280
- Looks good, huh?
- Yeah.

247

You don't have random thoughts in your head.

248

I think it's good.

249

Are you all right?

251
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.620
No. I couldn't sleep for several days and...

252
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.470
I worked so hard to meet my deadline...

253
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:14.240
Did I do it to get chewed up like this? I'm so full of it.

254
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:21.860
Forget it. I'll quit everything. That's all it takes.

255
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.540
There's no purpose in life.

256
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.900
What would you do if you don't draw cartoons?

257
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.960
Whatever you do, people will talk about you.

258
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.770
But it's happiness when they're talking crap about you while doing the work you love.

259
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.790
Hey. Don't you remember when you used to post vicious comments?

260
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.790
You seemed to complain even when you had a chance. So, I did it out of anger.

261
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.250
But as for attacking your personally... I apologize.

262
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.370
Forget it.

263
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.110
Why should I continue to do this...

264
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:15.260
"There's no heaven when you arrive at a place when you run away."

265
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.590
"The only thing there is..."

266
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.980
"A battlefield as expected."

267
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.350
Don't think about anything today and get some rest.

Not without any problems. Ultimately, yes.

275
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.080
Director Jeong didn't tell you?

276
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.450
It's a bit sudden. What happened?

277
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:25.660
Somehow, an opportunity came up for me.

278
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.600
So, I grabbed it.

279

You know that I like Moon Soo.

280
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.960
I'm not asking you about your personal affairs. Why again at the construction site...

281
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.180
I'm saying because of Moon Soo.

282
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:50.830
I didn't think I'd be a good person like you, CEO. So, I had given up on her early on.

283
00:27:53.230 --> 00:28:00.200
But if I really tried hard, I felt that I could be a good person to at least one person.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.340
So, I'm going to try to do that.

Yeah.

289

This is totally central.

290
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:40.110
That's why. It's visible and people can see it as they walk by. It's nice.

291
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.450
Nothing is going to change. You just do what you've been doing.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.160
I was wondering if I can take a look at it.

329

Could you get it for me, Team Leader?

332
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.990
Hyung. From the way things have been going, this isn't right. Don't you think?

333
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.570
What did I say is the best in the winter?

- Yeah, it's good.

Hyung. We have lots of money now. Let's just buy this.

337
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:16.040
Then, we can eat fishcake all winter long.

338
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.120
It's not my money.

339

I'll do my best in my life and pay back to Grandma.

340

- Hyung. I think God really exists.
- What?

341
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:34.360
He felt so sorry for you that He sent you Grandma to you.

342
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:39.010
He must've felt really bad.

He's much more dependable than his age. He's hard working than I expected.
