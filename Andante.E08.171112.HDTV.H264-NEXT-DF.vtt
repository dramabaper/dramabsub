5
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.644
Clean the floor well, so it shines.

6
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.854
Lee Shi Kyung, it's been a long time.

7
00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:07.998
I saw you yesterday.

8
00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.513
I haven't seen you in the
teacher's office in a long time.

9
00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:13.774
You're being punished
with cleaning duty, though? Why?

10
00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:16.426
He was late, and I'm letting him
off easy with cleaning duty.

11
00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:20.197
But, Shi Kyung doesn't look like
he's being punished.

12
00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:22.557
Something about this suits him.

13
00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:26.925
Yes, you've been on cleaning duty
so often that you have good form.

14
00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:29.718
Clean up around my seat, too.

15
00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:31.857
Oh, Lee Shi Kyung is busy.

16
00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.498
He hasn't even started cleaning the room.

17
00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:36.819
Oh yeah... Shi Kyung.

18
00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.938
You heard that Bom is going to be
absent due to a family trip, right?

19
00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:41.783
What? When?

20
00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:45.107
You didn't know? Aren't you two dating?

21
00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:49.063
What is this?
Are you two fighting already?

22
00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:51.411
Is something wrong?

23
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.265
If you stand idly by, not acknowledging
your girlfriend's feelings...

24
00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:55.572
you'll be in trouble.

25
00:01:58.536 --> 00:01:59.806
Oh, Shi Kyung!

26
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.047
Were you late?

27
00:02:03.212 --> 00:02:05.730
You were standing around,
taking forever this morning.

28
00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.113
<i>Am I really...</i>

29
00:02:13.463 --> 00:02:15.643
<i>standing around and
not taking action?</i>

30
00:02:15.643 --> 00:02:16.986
<i>What is it?</i>

31
00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:22.489
This song is loved as much
as the Italian national anthem.

32
00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.630
Kids...

33
00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:36.747
<i>Ma n'atu sole</i>
(Singing in Italian)

34
00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:39.196
<i>cchiù bello, oje ne'.</i>

35
00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:43.155
<i>O sole mio</i>

36
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:46.399
<i>sta 'nfronte a te.</i>

37
00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.098
<i>O sole...</i>

38
00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:52.009
<i>O sole mio.</i>

39
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.505
<i>Sta 'nfronte a te.</i>

40
00:02:55.505 --> 00:03:00.558
<i>Sta 'nfronte a te!</i>

41
00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:06.967
<i>O sole mio!</i>

42
00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:14.160
<i>Wow! Aunt Jung Soo.</i>

43
00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:28.519
What's with the book?

44
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.208
I haven't seen you read in a while.

45
00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:44.233
Do you have time this Saturday?

46
00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:47.093
Do you want to come to Seoul
with me and Shi Kyung?

47
00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:50.415
- I can't.
- Why?

48
00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:52.703
I have plans in Seoul that day already.

49
00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:56.542
In Seoul?

50
00:04:11.248 --> 00:04:13.263
You're all done? Let's go now.

51
00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:37.118
Now that we're going like this,
I'm suddenly reminded of that movie.

52
00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.426
"Thelma and Louise."

53
00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:45.079
Am I Thelma or Louise?

54
00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:48.228
Who is he?

55
00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.608
You know him, that good looking thief.

56
00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:53.827
Ah, Brad Pitt!

57
00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:56.305
Right! "Mister Bread."

58
00:04:57.553 --> 00:04:58.649
That's a funny nickname.

59
00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.640
<i>She's saying her son
is like a good looking thief.</i>

60
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.359
<i>Mom sure likes it.</i>

61
00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:06.702
You must need to study a lot as
a high school junior, Shi Kyung.

62
00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:08.289
What's your ranking at school?

63
00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.760
Does this town let you specialize
in agricultural studies?

64
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.654
Ah, well...

65
00:05:13.654 --> 00:05:15.899
English, writing,
physical education, and art.

66
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.654
What are your specialties?

67
00:05:17.654 --> 00:05:20.115
What about clubs for your major?

68
00:05:20.115 --> 00:05:22.416
Books related to your major?

69
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.015
Ask me if there's anything
you're curious about.

70
00:05:27.654 --> 00:05:29.729
She said you could ask.

71
00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.087
Don't you have any questions?

72
00:05:31.087 --> 00:05:33.361
No, not really.

73
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:36.373
Oh yeah. You have a girlfriend.

74
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:40.380
It's hard to study
when you have a girlfriend.

75
00:05:41.448 --> 00:05:46.041
There's a very smart boy
named Jin Hyuk in Soo Bin's class.

76
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:50.683
After he got a girlfriend,
he lost to my Soo Bin right away.

77
00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:54.890
Whether he has a girlfriend or not,
it won't affect his grades.

78
00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:57.599
Really?

79
00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.651
That would be hard at his age.

80
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.962
It won't be so hard for him.

81
00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:03.746
His grades maintain themselves.

82
00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:12.709
Get something good to eat with this.

83
00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:14.123
No, it's okay.

84
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.204
You don't need to do that.

85
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.620
Stay nearby and pick up
the phone when I call you.

86
00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.777
- You really don't need to!
- Come on.

87
00:06:23.777 --> 00:06:26.253
Why are you giving him money?

88
00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:32.972
<i>The moment she gave me the money,
I thought about what to do with Bom.</i>

89
00:06:32.972 --> 00:06:34.200
<i>I want to beat myself up.</i>

90
00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:41.087
You came here with a bike chain?

91
00:06:41.087 --> 00:06:43.229
- Yes.
- Why here?

92
00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:44.921
Why would you bring a bike chain?

93
00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:48.440
I brought my bike chain in case someone
started something, and I needed to fight.

94
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.671
I'm only kidding.

95
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:54.901
I heard about a guy I knew doing that,
so I copied him because it was cool.

96
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.844
What? You did?

97
00:06:56.844 --> 00:06:58.676
I was going through puberty back then.

98
00:06:58.676 --> 00:07:00.979
You don't know about
boys and puberty, right?

99
00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.758
Lee Shi Kyung and puberty...

100
00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:05.339
I think I understand it.

101
00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:07.940
Your actions are nothing compared
to Shi Kyung's during puberty.

102
00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.580
Why here though?

103
00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:15.234
If I do go to college,
I better go to medical school.

104
00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.204
I think that's when
I first thought about it.

105
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:22.748
I've seen many sick people
at the hospice ever since I was little.

106
00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:26.548
Honestly, my mom passed away
from an illness, too.

107
00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.839
We may have even met before.

108
00:07:36.637 --> 00:07:39.979
During my last year of junior high,
I came to this medical building, too.

109
00:07:43.788 --> 00:07:44.834
You did?

110
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:55.063
All the moms would gather here
to share information about exams.

111
00:07:55.063 --> 00:07:56.904
We would go nuts over it.

112
00:07:57.842 --> 00:07:59.762
You really are amazing, Soo Bin's mom.

113
00:08:01.423 --> 00:08:04.104
I don't know what I've done for my kids.

114
00:08:04.104 --> 00:08:07.005
I thought I was doing my best.

115
00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:10.322
I keep asking myself lately
if it really was the best.

116
00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:12.923
Who knows the right answer?

117
00:08:12.923 --> 00:08:15.868
Everyone does what's best
in his or her life.

118
00:08:15.868 --> 00:08:16.923
You think so?

119
00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:27.508
I'll ask Doctor Lee
if you can have just one sip.

120
00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.647
What's wrong?

121
00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:37.951
Are you sick? Do you need your medicine?

122
00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:41.833
Soo Bin's mom.

123
00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:53.240
I've missed my regular
daily life so much.

124
00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:59.688
Just drinking coffee
and grocery shopping.

125
00:08:59.688 --> 00:09:01.318
Making dinner...

126
00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.096
Just for a day...

127
00:09:09.596 --> 00:09:12.018
I wanted to come back for one day.

128
00:09:22.183 --> 00:09:25.223
I have lived so diligently in my life.

129
00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:31.529
I really worked so hard in life.

130
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.640
I know you did.

131
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.768
You still are right now.

132
00:09:39.035 --> 00:09:42.313
Seriously, what am I doing
wasting my precious time?

133
00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:45.643
Let's go grocery shopping.

134
00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.534
Soo Bin likes soybean paste soup
with blue crabs in it.

135
00:09:50.534 --> 00:09:52.083
Let's go look at blue crabs.

136
00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.784
It's blue crab season. Sounds good.

137
00:09:54.784 --> 00:09:55.817
Let's go.

138
00:09:57.134 --> 00:09:58.736
It has been a long time.

139
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.028
Are you giving me good ones
because it has been so long?

140
00:10:04.028 --> 00:10:05.805
Thank you.

141
00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.989
Did you go away somewhere?

142
00:10:07.989 --> 00:10:09.689
I haven't seen you around
for a long time.

143
00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:11.521
Yes.

144
00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:17.399
This is the medical school
my dad went to.

145
00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:20.340
Oh, Doctor Lee went here, too.

146
00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:24.343
There are two people from our
school who went to medical school.

147
00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:26.799
Oh, then you'll become the third?

148
00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:29.780
We'll have to see.

149
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.532
Why did you come here in junior high?

150
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:34.981
Same reason as you.

151
00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:39.401
I had good grades back then.

152
00:10:39.401 --> 00:10:41.140
I wanted to go to medical school, too.

153
00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:43.452
Back then, anyway.

154
00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:45.136
Why not anymore?

155
00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:48.264
It doesn't make sense anymore,
not with my grades.

156
00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:50.694
Do you know why I really
asked you to come here?

157
00:10:52.828 --> 00:10:53.978
Will you...

158
00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:56.920
study with me?

159
00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:00.496
What?

160
00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:05.182
Since you gave me the bike,
I will help you with your studies.

161
00:11:13.688 --> 00:11:14.717
My phone!

162
00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:17.539
Did I leave it in the car?

163
00:11:26.275 --> 00:11:30.276
<i>I can't remember a single number
without my phone.</i>

164
00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:33.792
<i>How could this happen?</i>

165
00:11:56.937 --> 00:12:00.241
Lee Shi Kyung! You're acting weird.

166
00:12:01.501 --> 00:12:03.136
That's not Bom.

167
00:12:04.134 --> 00:12:06.245
After going through all of that...

168
00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:08.865
Bom wouldn't be in Seoul.

169
00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.986
<i>But, what if it is Bom?</i>

170
00:12:21.805 --> 00:12:24.245
Just two portions?
What about your husband?

171
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.398
I guess you didn't know.

172
00:12:26.398 --> 00:12:28.005
I'm a divorced, single mom.

173
00:12:29.678 --> 00:12:31.890
What's the matter?
Have you never met one before?

174
00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:37.669
Even when he was around,
he was always abroad on business trips.

175
00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:40.366
I had to earn a lot of money.

176
00:12:40.366 --> 00:12:44.258
I wanted to be able to send Soo Bin
to college and get her married.

177
00:12:44.258 --> 00:12:45.500
We had to live together.

178
00:12:47.624 --> 00:12:50.160
How have you managed
all of that for so long?

179
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.754
You worked and had treatment.

180
00:12:53.754 --> 00:12:56.776
I don't know. I'm even amazed at myself.

181
00:13:03.044 --> 00:13:04.817
Can you taste this for me?

182
00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:07.457
I'm not sure
of my sense of taste, lately.

183
00:13:12.077 --> 00:13:13.759
It could use a little salt.

184
00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.280
That's good then.
Soo Bin likes it that way.

185
00:13:20.684 --> 00:13:21.736
Oh...

186
00:13:22.957 --> 00:13:23.986
It's Soo Bin.

187
00:13:25.787 --> 00:13:27.588
I don't have to put on a show today.

188
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:31.538
Hello.

189
00:13:32.573 --> 00:13:34.893
<i>Mom, you're really home.</i>

190
00:13:34.893 --> 00:13:36.533
<i>What are you making? What's for dinner?</i>

191
00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:40.662
I made soybean paste soup
with blue crabs and stuffed squid.

192
00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:44.013
Wow! I'm already salivating.

193
00:13:44.013 --> 00:13:46.532
Mom, you know Hyo Eun?

194
00:13:46.532 --> 00:13:48.672
I'm going to go buy clothes with her.

195
00:13:50.242 --> 00:13:52.673
Wait a little bit. I'll be right there.

196
00:13:52.673 --> 00:13:55.861
Okay, don't run just to get here quickly.

197
00:13:55.861 --> 00:13:57.232
Okay, Mom.

198
00:13:57.807 --> 00:14:00.228
Gosh, she's still just a baby.

199
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.188
Where did he go off to?

200
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:05.673
Oh yeah, Shi Kyung.

201
00:14:05.673 --> 00:14:07.914
Should he just have eaten here?

202
00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:10.495
What are you talking about?
Today is a special day.

203
00:14:10.495 --> 00:14:13.318
You spend time with your daughter,
just the two of you.

204
00:14:22.893 --> 00:14:25.064
Where is this place?

205
00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.742
Mom will be calling me.

206
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.745
Where am I?

207
00:14:43.492 --> 00:14:45.265
Why isn't he answering?

208
00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:49.986
Shi Young is in Seoul too.

209
00:14:54.183 --> 00:14:56.913
She wouldn't answer my call.
She has no manners.

210
00:14:56.913 --> 00:14:58.715
<i>Hello.</i>

211
00:14:58.715 --> 00:15:01.024
Lee Shi Young? Shi Young.

212
00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.896
It's just that Shi Kyung
isn't answering his phone.

213
00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:14.542
Shi Young, come here now.
I'll send you the address now, so hurry!

214
00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:16.481
Get up, Soo Bin's mom.

215
00:15:16.481 --> 00:15:17.601
Lift your hands.

216
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:19.981
Put your arms up.

217
00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:21.032
Hurry.

218
00:15:22.752 --> 00:15:25.384
We need to do an enema.

219
00:15:25.384 --> 00:15:27.852
- I don't want to.
- What do you mean?

220
00:15:27.852 --> 00:15:30.033
You have to do it.
You could fall into a coma.

221
00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:33.293
Doctor Lee said this is the worst.
You know that very well.

222
00:15:34.207 --> 00:15:36.029
I don't want to. I don't want to.

223
00:15:36.328 --> 00:15:39.081
I don't want you
to see me in that state.

224
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:41.600
What if Soo Bin returns soon?

225
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.549
Are you going to greet her like this?

226
00:15:44.567 --> 00:15:46.952
Soo Bin... what do I do?

227
00:15:46.952 --> 00:15:50.230
I'll just do it right away.

228
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.524
Wait here for a moment.

229
00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:02.550
I think it's on the 7th floor here.
Let's get up there.

230
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.164
Yes, I've done the enema.

231
00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:07.332
Which medicine? Hold on.

232
00:16:09.413 --> 00:16:11.871
I found it.
It's called IR Codon, right?

233
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:14.731
How many pills?

234
00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:17.131
Okay, I'll give it to her.

235
00:16:22.728 --> 00:16:25.684
Take these painkillers.
You'll feel better in a little bit.

236
00:16:29.292 --> 00:16:30.675
Soo Bin will be here soon.

237
00:16:31.606 --> 00:16:35.135
I'm not very good at it,
but I'll massage your feet.

238
00:16:35.135 --> 00:16:38.687
Don't think about a thing
and stay still for a moment.

239
00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:41.206
Should I carry you to your bed?

240
00:16:42.846 --> 00:16:45.558
I'm sorry to all of you.
This is all because of me.

241
00:16:45.558 --> 00:16:49.177
I told you not to say a thing
or think about anything.

242
00:16:49.177 --> 00:16:52.133
Aren't you going to have dinner
with Soo Bin tonight?

243
00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:54.067
All right.

244
00:16:54.067 --> 00:16:56.197
Please give me Soo Bin's number.

245
00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:59.586
- Why?
- I'll try to buy you more time.

246
00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:01.787
Just until you feel better.

247
00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:05.346
That sounds like a good idea.
We can do that, right?

248
00:17:05.346 --> 00:17:08.686
I really can't let her see me like this.

249
00:17:08.686 --> 00:17:11.617
Go on, then.
How will you do it though?

250
00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:12.877
I'll take care of it.

251
00:17:12.877 --> 00:17:14.899
Just give me Soo Bin's number.

252
00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.898
Soo Bin's here. What do we do?

253
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.777
Mom!

254
00:17:26.147 --> 00:17:27.761
My daughter.

255
00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:29.825
I missed you.

256
00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:33.282
Mom, you smell different.

257
00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:34.522
You smell like medicine.

258
00:17:36.024 --> 00:17:37.090
Something's wrong.

259
00:17:38.126 --> 00:17:39.545
It's a cold.

260
00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.696
Do I already smell because I'm old?

261
00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.348
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:03.848 --> 00:18:06.228
Make sure to take Shi Kyung's phone.

263
00:18:06.228 --> 00:18:08.226
I don't even know if he made it home.

264
00:18:08.226 --> 00:18:10.565
He's always leaving things behind.

265
00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:19.919
She hasn't been home in so long,
and I left her alone in an empty house.

266
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.419
She said she would call Hyo Eun over.

267
00:18:22.678 --> 00:18:25.549
Your daughter seemed fine,
but you're the problem.

268
00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:29.441
Doctor Lee said staying overnight
would be too dangerous.

269
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:30.800
What can we do?

270
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.387
I shouldn't have come.

271
00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:38.177
If I had known it was going
to hurt this much...

272
00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:41.001
I shouldn't have come to see her.

273
00:18:43.397 --> 00:18:46.592
Ma'am, what if you
make yourself sick again?

274
00:19:02.063 --> 00:19:03.133
<i>Dad.</i>

275
00:19:04.003 --> 00:19:08.294
<i>You shoved that hint in my face.
What was the point?</i>

276
00:19:16.662 --> 00:19:18.636
<i>This is torture.</i>

277
00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:20.431
<i>Torture by the name Bom.</i>

278
00:19:27.044 --> 00:19:28.534
I heard you went on a family trip.

279
00:19:29.932 --> 00:19:31.117
That was a lie.

280
00:19:31.855 --> 00:19:33.236
I didn't want to go to school.

281
00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:37.557
Why do you keep lying?

282
00:19:38.437 --> 00:19:41.003
Things have been very hard for me
these past few days.

283
00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:43.592
I've been getting strange ideas.

284
00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:47.536
What kind of strange ideas?

285
00:19:53.247 --> 00:19:57.100
You told me you can't know
if I don't tell you.

286
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.472
That's how it is for me too.

287
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.249
If you don't tell me,
then I won't know.

288
00:20:04.999 --> 00:20:06.972
I don't know how to tell you.

289
00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:12.572
Contact me when you're ready to tell me.

290
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.833
I wish you wouldn't do it.

291
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:24.961
I wish you wouldn't do
that kind of work anymore.

292
00:20:25.938 --> 00:20:27.739
I don't know you that well yet.

293
00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:30.118
Maybe I'm saying this because
I'm ignorant about the world.

294
00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:35.969
But, when you do things for me with
money earned from that kind of job...

295
00:20:35.969 --> 00:20:37.512
I'm not happy about it at all.

296
00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:40.939
It makes me imagine strange things.

297
00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:44.890
You meeting guys I don't know.

298
00:20:48.542 --> 00:20:50.302
Don't do that job.

299
00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:01.390
<i>I told her.</i>

300
00:21:02.001 --> 00:21:04.890
<i>I stood idly by,
and then finally said it.</i>

301
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:07.419
<i>Did I do the right thing?</i>

302
00:21:49.128 --> 00:21:50.766
<i>[Bernard]</i>

303
00:22:26.286 --> 00:22:27.369
I'm sorry.

304
00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:30.480
I'm sorry about everything.

305
00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:32.928
I like you, but...

306
00:22:34.489 --> 00:22:36.589
I don't know how to act with you.

307
00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:45.878
<i>We are both inexperienced.</i>

308
00:22:47.748 --> 00:22:48.958
<i>But...</i>

309
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:03.282
I'm the one who's sorry.

310
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.417
<i>We are still getting to know one another.</i>

311
00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:16.506
What a relief that you arrived safely.

312
00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:20.528
I've given you medication
to help you sleep, so get some rest.

313
00:23:20.528 --> 00:23:21.656
Okay.

314
00:23:22.307 --> 00:23:25.756
I should've come with you.
You did a good job.

315
00:23:25.756 --> 00:23:27.796
I just did as you instructed, Doctor.

316
00:23:28.927 --> 00:23:30.057
I'll get going then.

317
00:23:30.057 --> 00:23:33.600
Thank you, Shi Kyung's mom
and all of you.

318
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.660
Get some rest.

319
00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:40.151
Mom, I need to talk to her for a moment.

320
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:41.171
What?

321
00:23:41.834 --> 00:23:43.594
She needs to sleep.

322
00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:46.265
I just need a minute.
Can you wait outside for a moment?

323
00:23:57.658 --> 00:24:01.522
<i>These are just my thoughts,
so please hear me out.</i>

324
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:09.821
I wish you would be honest
and tell Soo Bin the truth.

325
00:24:11.351 --> 00:24:14.050
I don't know if my mom told you.

326
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:18.907
My dad went missing 12 years ago.

327
00:24:18.907 --> 00:24:20.840
We didn't get to say goodbye.

328
00:24:22.227 --> 00:24:26.338
There are many people who leave
this world without saying goodbye.

329
00:24:27.977 --> 00:24:29.578
For those who are left behind...

330
00:24:30.947 --> 00:24:32.888
do you know how hard it is?

331
00:24:34.578 --> 00:24:38.227
You can still say goodbye,
so why won't you do it?

332
00:24:41.804 --> 00:24:43.023
Soo Bin...

333
00:24:44.496 --> 00:24:46.713
will go through such a hard time.

334
00:24:46.713 --> 00:24:48.692
She has to study.

335
00:24:48.692 --> 00:24:52.977
Why are you only thinking
about yourself?

336
00:24:52.977 --> 00:24:56.097
Don't you care about Soo Bin?
She'll be left alone.

337
00:24:57.266 --> 00:25:00.369
Why is studying so important right now?

338
00:25:02.387 --> 00:25:04.897
If you leave without saying anything...

339
00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:09.368
Soo Bin will face
that hardship her entire life.

340
00:25:10.265 --> 00:25:13.006
I know all about that so well.

341
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.485
<i>When someone leaves without a word...</i>

342
00:25:19.774 --> 00:25:21.392
and you can't see them again.

343
00:25:23.744 --> 00:25:24.986
That's what's really difficult.

344
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.567
Shi Young.

345
00:25:47.637 --> 00:25:50.407
I want to apologize to you
about something.

346
00:25:50.407 --> 00:25:51.450
What?

347
00:25:55.438 --> 00:25:58.083
I always say conflicting things,
just like you said.

348
00:25:59.165 --> 00:26:00.774
I've been watching Soo Bin's mom.

349
00:26:01.353 --> 00:26:05.206
I should've been studying just as hard
if I wanted you to study.

350
00:26:05.206 --> 00:26:07.143
I only told you to study.

351
00:26:07.143 --> 00:26:08.711
I'm glad you know.

352
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.398
You're so good to other people's moms.

353
00:26:18.274 --> 00:26:19.619
Mom, you should live a long time.

354
00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:23.422
Who else would accept
my bad temper if not you?

355
00:26:23.422 --> 00:26:24.508
What?

356
00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:27.258
You never know.
You might see me mature.

357
00:26:32.306 --> 00:26:33.968
As if you would mature.

358
00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:04.745
Hello.

359
00:27:09.348 --> 00:27:12.364
<i>I need you to give me a ride to the
library after class, Driver Park.</i>

360
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.649
Eom Yong Gi, what did you say?

361
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:20.177
I'll go first.

362
00:27:26.355 --> 00:27:27.707
All right. Go ahead.

363
00:27:31.307 --> 00:27:33.657
Being able to say no when
it doesn't want to do something.

364
00:27:33.657 --> 00:27:36.697
That's a human trait AI
does not have. The end!

365
00:27:38.425 --> 00:27:39.612
Hey!

366
00:27:40.533 --> 00:27:41.697
Be quiet!

367
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.935
Sit down.

368
00:27:46.011 --> 00:27:47.881
Tell Eom Yong Gi he got a zero.

369
00:27:49.092 --> 00:27:50.122
Lee Shi Kyung.

370
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.520
You go next.

371
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.990
Sense of temperature.

372
00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.630
Sense of temperature.

373
00:28:06.498 --> 00:28:07.563
What?

374
00:28:10.426 --> 00:28:11.826
The warmth of holding hands.

375
00:28:13.138 --> 00:28:16.265
The excitement and feeling
of your heart dropping.

376
00:28:17.236 --> 00:28:19.717
The tingling sensation
when you feel that bond.

377
00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:21.757
Tears...

378
00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:27.364
Also, being able to apologize.

379
00:28:29.998 --> 00:28:32.476
Those are things AI
will never be able to do.

380
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:37.008
- Oh!
- Lee Shi Kyung!

381
00:28:38.918 --> 00:28:43.248
<i>If anyone says anything more to me,
I'm going to run out like Yong Gi.</i>

382
00:29:06.272 --> 00:29:09.504
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E08 Andante "Invitation to Daily Life"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

383
00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:35.235
<i>Bom passed out?</i>

384
00:29:35.235 --> 00:29:38.835
Yes, the homeroom teacher and
Lee Shi Kyung went to the ER with her.

385
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.740
Really?

386
00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.751
I guess the two of them
will have to do it later.

387
00:29:43.751 --> 00:29:44.899
Let's start.

388
00:29:48.314 --> 00:29:51.725
<i>Che bella cosa
(Singing in Italian)</i>

389
00:29:51.725 --> 00:29:55.416
<i>na jurnata 'e sole.</i>

390
00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:58.745
<i>Pe' ll'aria fresca.</i>

391
00:29:58.745 --> 00:30:01.362
<i>Che bella...</i>

392
00:30:02.177 --> 00:30:05.656
<i>Na jurnata 'e sole.</i>

393
00:30:09.965 --> 00:30:11.884
Eom Yong Gi, aren't you going to sing?

394
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.555
I'll tell you when. Let's do it again.

395
00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:22.878
<i>Ma n'atu sole...</i>

396
00:30:22.878 --> 00:30:26.600
<i>cchiu' bello, oje ne'.</i>

397
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.291
<i>O sole mio.</i>

398
00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:34.853
<i>Sta 'nfronte a te!</i>

399
00:30:34.853 --> 00:30:37.571
<i>O sole...</i>

400
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:41.305
<i>O sole mio.</i>

401
00:30:41.305 --> 00:30:48.880
<i>Sta 'nfronte a te.</i>

402
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.294
- Wow!
- Wow!

403
00:30:53.579 --> 00:30:56.061
- That was so good.
- Wow.

404
00:30:57.963 --> 00:31:00.729
Yong Gi! Wow!

405
00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:06.485
Amazing, amazing.
Eom Yong Gi is amazing.

406
00:31:06.485 --> 00:31:08.395
Has he always been a good singer?

407
00:31:08.395 --> 00:31:10.368
That was my first time seeing him sing.

408
00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:13.277
- I think I know why he sings well.
- Why?

409
00:31:13.277 --> 00:31:16.167
Yong Gi would go buy rice wine
for his grandfather.

410
00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:18.903
It's rumored that he would steal a sip.

411
00:31:18.903 --> 00:31:20.947
You're saying he sings well
because of rice wine?

412
00:31:20.947 --> 00:31:22.351
I've never heard such a thing.

413
00:31:22.351 --> 00:31:24.899
You don't know what
you're saying about alcohol.

414
00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:29.618
Alcohol allows you
to sing well naturally.

415
00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:34.208
All your stories start out
plausible and end terribly.

416
00:31:34.208 --> 00:31:37.030
Starting out plausible is important.
The beginning is half of it.

417
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.178
You talk too much.

418
00:31:39.178 --> 00:31:41.329
Do you think Bom is okay?

419
00:31:41.329 --> 00:31:42.938
Shi Kyung isn't back yet.

420
00:31:46.188 --> 00:31:47.300
Yes, yes.

421
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.038
Shi Kyung is here.

422
00:31:51.028 --> 00:31:52.771
I'll let him know.

423
00:31:52.771 --> 00:31:53.829
Bye.

424
00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:57.819
- That was Teacher Oh Jung Soo.
- Aunt.

425
00:31:58.715 --> 00:32:01.182
I mean the music teacher.

426
00:32:01.182 --> 00:32:03.320
She's asked if Bom was okay.

427
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.381
You and Bom missed the music assessment,
so you two can do it later.

428
00:32:07.381 --> 00:32:11.079
Right, that was today.

429
00:32:11.079 --> 00:32:14.069
Go back to Bom and call me
once you have the results.

430
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.685
Try not to worry.

431
00:32:17.357 --> 00:32:18.436
Go on inside.

432
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.444
She's already there?

433
00:33:03.371 --> 00:33:05.372
<i>No, I'm on my way there.</i>

434
00:33:19.939 --> 00:33:22.186
What are you doing?

435
00:33:22.186 --> 00:33:23.245
Are you okay?

436
00:33:24.216 --> 00:33:26.863
Still, you shouldn't run off
from the hospital.

437
00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:28.867
Let's go back now.

438
00:33:28.867 --> 00:33:31.679
It's just anemia. It has
happened a few times before.

439
00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.336
You should see the results though.
Let's go back to the hospital.

440
00:33:36.428 --> 00:33:37.696
I'll go back later.

441
00:33:38.698 --> 00:33:42.669
You should go up there and try it out.

442
00:33:47.412 --> 00:33:48.509
How is it?

443
00:33:50.252 --> 00:33:51.788
Isn't it fun to see it upside down?

444
00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:55.439
I'm so dizzy. I'm going to die.

445
00:33:55.439 --> 00:33:57.317
Do you really pretend you're dead?

446
00:33:57.317 --> 00:33:58.848
You really could die doing this.

447
00:33:58.848 --> 00:34:02.169
My dad would hang me upside down
like that when I was younger.

448
00:34:02.169 --> 00:34:05.064
A tall giraffe like you?

449
00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:06.996
I said when I was younger.

450
00:34:06.996 --> 00:34:10.461
When Dad would hang me upside down

451
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:14.116
I thought it was so much fun to see
the world spin around and around.

452
00:34:14.116 --> 00:34:17.074
So, I would beg him
to do it again and again.

453
00:34:17.074 --> 00:34:18.627
I want to do it for you.

454
00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:24.674
You're too long now.

455
00:34:24.674 --> 00:34:25.721
Oh yeah!

456
00:34:31.973 --> 00:34:34.161
There's a picture. Who is that?

457
00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:36.399
My dad.

458
00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:38.118
He looks very young.

459
00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:41.707
My dad never changes
and is very young looking.

460
00:34:44.935 --> 00:34:46.368
Do you want to meet him?

461
00:34:46.368 --> 00:34:47.469
Your dad?

462
00:34:48.808 --> 00:34:51.455
I'm supposed to go night fishing
with him in a few days.

463
00:34:51.455 --> 00:34:53.083
Come with us.

464
00:34:53.083 --> 00:34:54.652
We have exams soon.

465
00:34:54.652 --> 00:34:56.473
What does that have to do with you?

466
00:34:57.312 --> 00:34:58.342
Uh...

467
00:34:59.534 --> 00:35:01.123
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

468
00:35:07.873 --> 00:35:10.725
Oh, Kim Bom. You're very popular.

469
00:35:12.103 --> 00:35:14.592
"Is Bom very sick?"
"What's going on with Bom?"

470
00:35:14.592 --> 00:35:16.424
"Is Bom awake? How is she?"

471
00:35:16.424 --> 00:35:17.495
"Is Bom okay?"

472
00:35:17.495 --> 00:35:18.723
Everyone is worried about you.

473
00:35:34.141 --> 00:35:35.170
You're early.

474
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.069
It's cold. Let's get inside.

475
00:35:37.971 --> 00:35:40.330
Oh, what's this?

476
00:35:43.611 --> 00:35:44.935
First semester was literature.

477
00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:48.962
Second semester was divided
between reading and grammar.

478
00:35:48.962 --> 00:35:53.214
There are parts that can be hard with
hasty preparation for Mr. Kang's exams.

479
00:35:53.214 --> 00:35:55.281
Like what?

480
00:35:55.281 --> 00:35:58.853
You have to know about
the reciprocity of the literature.

481
00:35:58.853 --> 00:36:01.337
You need to know the writer's
other works, as well.

482
00:36:01.337 --> 00:36:03.841
You have to give a real
life example with grammar.

483
00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:06.746
You'll need an example
from the work of literature too.

484
00:36:08.743 --> 00:36:11.549
Do we have to study in secret like this?

485
00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:13.645
You should just come out about it.

486
00:36:13.645 --> 00:36:15.676
Do not let the enemy know
about my studying.

487
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.768
Imagine if I revealed I was studying.

488
00:36:18.768 --> 00:36:21.062
How would I handle my mom's expectations?

489
00:36:25.056 --> 00:36:28.125
These are Mister Kang's exam problems
from previous years, so take a look.

490
00:36:31.306 --> 00:36:34.335
This is way too hard!
I don't know what it means at all.

491
00:36:36.116 --> 00:36:39.156
Keep it down, would you?
You two aren't the only ones here.

492
00:36:51.406 --> 00:36:55.708
Hey, hey! Wake up, would you?

493
00:36:55.708 --> 00:36:59.147
Your exam is the day after tomorrow.
Why are you sleeping so much?

494
00:36:59.147 --> 00:37:02.319
- Get up. Get up. Get up now!
- I don't want to.

495
00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:04.846
I said get up already!

496
00:37:08.554 --> 00:37:09.696
Oh, Kim...

497
00:37:10.607 --> 00:37:11.708
Good morning.

498
00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:14.429
No, I wasn't sleeping.

499
00:37:14.429 --> 00:37:16.170
Who would be asleep now?

500
00:37:16.917 --> 00:37:18.757
You weren't sleeping?

501
00:37:18.757 --> 00:37:21.670
Yeah, you're right.

502
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.016
Anyone who sleeps in
this late would be a bear.

503
00:37:24.016 --> 00:37:25.196
Seriously, that kid.

504
00:37:25.196 --> 00:37:27.228
<i>I know.</i>

505
00:37:27.228 --> 00:37:29.000
I'm going crazy here.

506
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.161
So, in order to talk
while other people are around...

507
00:37:33.161 --> 00:37:34.585
we need a few code words.

508
00:37:35.464 --> 00:37:37.524
I have to sneak out to go night fishing.

509
00:37:37.524 --> 00:37:39.600
It is exam time.

510
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.712
Code words? Like what?

511
00:37:42.712 --> 00:37:43.989
Your name...

512
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.806
- Bom...
- Bom.

513
00:37:47.842 --> 00:37:49.103
Bom...

514
00:37:50.634 --> 00:37:53.571
How about Bong Gu?
It sounds like a guy's name.

515
00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:55.900
Bong Gu? Kim Bong Gu.

516
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.560
Bernard and Bong Gu. That's funny.

517
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.243
"Let's meet now."

518
00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:02.580
"Let's go to the library."

519
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.779
How about for, "Someone is there"

520
00:38:03.779 --> 00:38:04.826
we say, "Have you seen the student dean?"

521
00:38:04.826 --> 00:38:06.158
You're a genius.

522
00:38:08.087 --> 00:38:13.362
I... want a code phrase
for something else.

523
00:38:13.362 --> 00:38:14.400
What?

524
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:17.221
"I miss you."

525
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:18.511
I'll make one for that.

526
00:38:21.551 --> 00:38:22.904
"Diamond."

527
00:38:22.904 --> 00:38:24.857
Diamond? Why?

528
00:38:24.857 --> 00:38:27.020
It's just pretty.

529
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.650
It's shiny, and it suits
the words, "I miss you."

530
00:38:30.788 --> 00:38:31.908
Sounds good.

531
00:38:32.672 --> 00:38:34.759
Bong Gu, diamond.

532
00:38:34.759 --> 00:38:36.040
Have you seen the student dean?

533
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.630
No, I haven't.

534
00:38:39.121 --> 00:38:40.634
You two are having a good time.

535
00:38:44.659 --> 00:38:46.380
Let's make one more.

536
00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.832
"Lee Shi Young is trash."

537
00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.330
What was that?

538
00:39:05.025 --> 00:39:07.154
So pathetic, so pathetic.

539
00:39:08.455 --> 00:39:09.743
I'm talking about Bernard.

540
00:39:09.743 --> 00:39:12.248
When it comes to him,
what you see is what you get.

541
00:39:12.248 --> 00:39:14.413
He is so thoughtless.

542
00:39:14.413 --> 00:39:17.109
They call that a perfect harmony.

543
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:19.712
He seems like the brother
of a girl who wanted to quit school.

544
00:39:19.712 --> 00:39:22.230
You're becoming
more and more like Bernard.

545
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.210
We're going to the library, right?

546
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.322
I'll get my bike.

547
00:39:25.322 --> 00:39:27.074
- Ga Ram.
- Ga Ram.

548
00:39:27.074 --> 00:39:28.431
Where have you been studying?

549
00:39:28.431 --> 00:39:30.107
- What time are you going?
- Where are you sitting?

550
00:39:30.107 --> 00:39:33.016
Ah, Shi Young doesn't know.

551
00:39:33.016 --> 00:39:35.717
There is a legend that your marks
will go up at least three points

552
00:39:35.717 --> 00:39:38.167
just by slightly touching
Ga Ram's clothes.

553
00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:42.263
I'm sorry but I want to study alone
this time around.

554
00:39:44.728 --> 00:39:47.484
Are you and Shi Young studying
together by chance?

555
00:39:47.484 --> 00:39:50.652
No, we're not. I'm leaving.

556
00:39:50.652 --> 00:39:51.926
Lee Shi Young, wait.

557
00:39:51.926 --> 00:39:53.801
Sorry, I have to go.

558
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:55.759
Lee Shi Young, I'll take you.

559
00:39:56.169 --> 00:39:58.446
- Something's there.
- Something's definitely there.

560
00:39:58.446 --> 00:40:00.328
It's so obvious, isn't it?
What's with them?

561
00:40:00.958 --> 00:40:05.236
Why aren't you answering my calls
and ignoring my messages?

562
00:40:06.174 --> 00:40:07.525
Don't touch that.

563
00:40:10.058 --> 00:40:12.525
Don't touch anything because
I'll get confused.

564
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.574
All right.

565
00:40:16.824 --> 00:40:18.315
Don't change the subject.

566
00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:20.580
Just give me the wages you owe me.

567
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.004
If you took up my time for five months,
you need to pay me.

568
00:40:24.004 --> 00:40:26.194
What? What did you say?

569
00:40:26.194 --> 00:40:28.094
You think you can say that?

570
00:40:30.054 --> 00:40:32.255
Well, when will things work out for you?

571
00:40:32.975 --> 00:40:36.754
You must be waiting for me to die,
but I'm alive and well.

572
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.147
I'm going to take the test,
and I won't go so easily...

573
00:40:42.147 --> 00:40:44.196
Hello? Hello?

574
00:40:44.196 --> 00:40:47.426
Hello, you bastard! You need
to pay up since I worked for you!

575
00:40:58.248 --> 00:40:59.777
Terminal stomach cancer?

576
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:03.422
But, he's still studying
for the civil service exam?

577
00:41:03.422 --> 00:41:06.513
Yes, there are patients like that
every now and then.

578
00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:10.524
How much money is he owed?

579
00:41:11.071 --> 00:41:15.111
I've heard him on the phone a few times,
and it's about two million won.

580
00:41:15.111 --> 00:41:19.754
He worked at a pool hall
while studying for his exam.

581
00:41:19.754 --> 00:41:22.476
Why are there so many inhumane people?

582
00:41:23.216 --> 00:41:25.736
The patient has quite
the personality, too.

583
00:41:25.736 --> 00:41:27.815
It would be better for him to give up.

584
00:41:27.815 --> 00:41:30.040
I guess it isn't easy for him.

585
00:41:32.641 --> 00:41:33.658
Yes?

586
00:41:37.149 --> 00:41:39.107
Mister Kim Jae Woong,
what can I do for you?

587
00:41:39.962 --> 00:41:44.301
About the volunteers for the baths...

588
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.919
when will they be here?

589
00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:49.721
Ah, I think you'll have to wait a bit.

590
00:41:49.721 --> 00:41:50.841
What can I do?

591
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:55.000
There aren't many volunteers available
to give baths, especially for men.

592
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:57.592
I see.

593
00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:07.576
Gosh, the patients really
look forward to baths.

594
00:42:08.745 --> 00:42:09.766
I feel very bad.

595
00:42:09.766 --> 00:42:12.004
Of course, they do.

596
00:42:12.004 --> 00:42:14.317
They are stewing in all sorts
of medication odors

597
00:42:14.317 --> 00:42:15.714
and they want to wash it off.

598
00:42:15.714 --> 00:42:18.176
That is when they feel alive.

599
00:42:18.176 --> 00:42:20.725
I only realized that once I got here.

600
00:42:20.725 --> 00:42:24.225
Just how much the patients wait
for the volunteers who give baths.

601
00:42:24.225 --> 00:42:26.630
Why wouldn't they?
They would wait for them.

602
00:42:27.609 --> 00:42:30.788
I guess you two do agree sometimes.

603
00:42:33.087 --> 00:42:34.618
What do you mean?

604
00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.489
You think I'm crazy?

605
00:42:51.197 --> 00:42:53.913
Something must not be going well.

606
00:42:53.913 --> 00:42:55.743
Oh, yes.

607
00:42:55.743 --> 00:42:57.156
What is it?

608
00:42:57.794 --> 00:43:00.178
I'm evaluating the students'
music assessments.

609
00:43:00.178 --> 00:43:01.576
I'm a little confused.

610
00:43:01.576 --> 00:43:02.844
These are absolute evaluations.

611
00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:05.076
I feel like I should give
them all good grades.

612
00:43:05.076 --> 00:43:08.072
But, it is an evaluation,
so I can't do that.

613
00:43:09.455 --> 00:43:12.306
Did you give detailed guidelines?

614
00:43:12.306 --> 00:43:14.726
Well, it is music.

615
00:43:14.726 --> 00:43:19.976
Interval, rhythm, posture...
You can have guidelines like that.

616
00:43:19.976 --> 00:43:23.819
If they're lacking in any areas,
then you can deduct points.

617
00:43:23.819 --> 00:43:27.109
Detailed guidelines.

618
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:30.460
Also, it's good to let them
confirm their grades right away.

619
00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.397
Confirm it right away.

620
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.074
The kids don't like a teacher
who seems afraid of them.

621
00:43:42.074 --> 00:43:44.551
Even if the teacher is unique,
they like a bold teacher.

622
00:43:44.551 --> 00:43:47.621
I must look like I'm afraid.

623
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:51.022
It would suit you to be more bold,
but honestly, you're not like that.

624
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:55.034
I'm not like that, honestly.

625
00:43:55.034 --> 00:43:56.315
So, you do know.

626
00:43:57.183 --> 00:44:00.275
By the way... your hair.

627
00:44:02.029 --> 00:44:03.614
Your hair is...

628
00:44:05.326 --> 00:44:06.366
Oh!

629
00:44:10.669 --> 00:44:12.187
- Aunt.
- Yeah.

630
00:44:13.442 --> 00:44:14.596
Teacher.

631
00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:17.835
My music assessment with Bom...

632
00:44:17.835 --> 00:44:20.098
Oh, when do you two have time?

633
00:44:20.098 --> 00:44:21.739
Lee Shi Kyung.

634
00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:24.400
I graded your ethics assessment.

635
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.489
Take a look.

636
00:44:33.893 --> 00:44:36.158
<i>Zero? Why?</i>

637
00:44:36.158 --> 00:44:37.174
<i>You did well on it.</i>

638
00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.464
That's what I'm saying.

639
00:44:38.464 --> 00:44:41.174
The student dean is out to get me.

640
00:44:41.174 --> 00:44:43.393
<i>Ask him why he gave you a zero.</i>

641
00:44:43.393 --> 00:44:44.784
<i>I don't understand.</i>

642
00:44:44.784 --> 00:44:47.266
Yeah, why did I get zero?

643
00:44:47.804 --> 00:44:49.855
I didn't run out like Yong Gi.

644
00:44:52.105 --> 00:44:53.453
Anyway, that's that.

645
00:44:53.946 --> 00:44:57.435
Yeah. Of course, we should meet.

646
00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:03.071
Where should we meet?
What do you want to eat?

647
00:45:03.071 --> 00:45:04.172
<i>Lee Shi Kyung!</i>

648
00:45:07.551 --> 00:45:10.654
Oh... the library?

649
00:45:10.654 --> 00:45:12.634
Yeah, I'll come.

650
00:45:12.634 --> 00:45:16.603
Yes, have you seen the student dean?

651
00:45:16.603 --> 00:45:20.007
Yes. Oh, you're so smart Bong Gu.

652
00:45:21.107 --> 00:45:22.875
Yes, me too.

653
00:45:22.875 --> 00:45:26.500
Diamond multiplied by diamond
multiplied by diamond.

654
00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.842
Okay, bye.

655
00:45:31.165 --> 00:45:32.755
That was my friend, Bong Gu.

656
00:45:32.755 --> 00:45:34.158
What's with your clothes?

657
00:45:34.806 --> 00:45:37.743
Also, don't even think about
going out late during exam time.

658
00:45:37.743 --> 00:45:41.054
No, I'm going to the library
with Bong Gu.

659
00:45:41.054 --> 00:45:42.875
Library? You?

660
00:45:42.875 --> 00:45:44.790
Can't I study?

661
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:48.145
Just eat dinner. Your grandma
made soybean paste soup.

662
00:45:49.395 --> 00:45:52.525
<i>Gosh, I have to eat dinner
with Bong Gu.</i>

663
00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:57.018
Today, I tried making
radish leaf, soybean paste soup.

664
00:45:57.018 --> 00:45:58.473
It's very tasty.

665
00:46:02.346 --> 00:46:03.545
This is amazing too.

666
00:46:03.545 --> 00:46:06.991
Grandma, what is this character
called when you spell soybean?

667
00:46:08.922 --> 00:46:09.955
When eating...

668
00:46:09.955 --> 00:46:11.844
one doesn't even bother a dog.

669
00:46:11.844 --> 00:46:13.804
Shi Young, you've been
in a good mood lately.

670
00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:15.538
Really? I'm the same.

671
00:46:18.837 --> 00:46:20.337
Are you not feeling well?

672
00:46:20.337 --> 00:46:22.176
Why haven't you touched your food?

673
00:46:24.835 --> 00:46:26.935
I'm having digestive trouble.

674
00:46:26.935 --> 00:46:28.652
I think I'll skip dinner.

675
00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:31.016
Oh no. You're having digestive trouble?

676
00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:33.529
Let's prick him with a needle.

677
00:46:33.529 --> 00:46:36.156
What? Prick me with a needle?

678
00:46:36.156 --> 00:46:38.763
A needle prick is the best
for indigestion.

679
00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:41.708
Grandma, here's the needle.

680
00:46:41.708 --> 00:46:42.721
Okay.

681
00:46:43.103 --> 00:46:46.591
Grandma, I'm not sick anymore.
I feel better now.

682
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:48.147
Stay put.

683
00:46:48.147 --> 00:46:50.116
She said to stay put!

684
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.716
Mother, I'll just give him
some indigestion medicine.

685
00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:58.279
You didn't even disinfect that needle.

686
00:47:01.015 --> 00:47:05.935
When I was raising Shi Yoon,
I didn't give him any medicine.

687
00:47:05.935 --> 00:47:07.875
Do you like those medicines that much?

688
00:47:07.875 --> 00:47:09.674
I didn't say that.

689
00:47:09.674 --> 00:47:11.766
The medications these days are so good.

690
00:47:11.766 --> 00:47:14.496
Grandma! I'm okay now.

691
00:47:14.496 --> 00:47:16.433
I'm so hungry. I should eat.

692
00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:25.851
Grandma, you should do this hand too.
I'll hold it for you.

693
00:47:25.851 --> 00:47:29.886
Oh dear... your hand is so cold.

694
00:47:29.886 --> 00:47:32.337
I should prick all 10 fingers.

695
00:47:32.337 --> 00:47:34.375
What do you mean all 10 fingers?

696
00:47:34.375 --> 00:47:36.368
Just give him some
indigestion medication.

697
00:47:36.368 --> 00:47:37.938
Be quiet!

698
00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:40.739
If you like medication so much,
you can use plenty of it.

699
00:47:41.654 --> 00:47:43.310
- Grandma.
- What about his feet?

700
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.984
You should prick his toes too.

701
00:48:07.002 --> 00:48:08.109
What the hell.

702
00:48:09.005 --> 00:48:11.359
I nearly died from taking a shower.

703
00:48:12.288 --> 00:48:13.328
Hey.

704
00:48:17.629 --> 00:48:18.687
What?

705
00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:23.438
Well, a person has fallen
in front of you.

706
00:48:23.438 --> 00:48:26.719
You should ask him if he's okay.

707
00:48:26.719 --> 00:48:28.670
Or call a doctor for him.

708
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.335
Why should I?

709
00:48:30.335 --> 00:48:31.806
I'm a patient too.

710
00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:34.257
Hey... wait.

711
00:48:35.437 --> 00:48:36.826
Wait a minute.

712
00:48:43.024 --> 00:48:44.712
Oh my. What's going on?

713
00:48:44.712 --> 00:48:46.582
What are you two doing here?

714
00:48:46.582 --> 00:48:48.232
This is a problem.

715
00:48:48.232 --> 00:48:51.944
Over here, over here, over here!

716
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.294
You arrogant bastard.

717
00:48:56.411 --> 00:49:00.549
You always bothered me.

718
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:05.350
You always showed off with your studying.

719
00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:08.701
Just die quietly, kid.

720
00:49:11.603 --> 00:49:12.678
Die!

721
00:49:12.678 --> 00:49:14.310
What are you doing?

722
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.380
Get off him. You can't do this.

723
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.960
Please restrain yourself. Please stop.

724
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.944
You need to stop.

725
00:49:20.944 --> 00:49:23.254
What's going on? Are you okay?

726
00:49:27.078 --> 00:49:28.708
- Pricked with a needle?
- Yes.

727
00:49:28.708 --> 00:49:30.237
I thought I was going to die.

728
00:49:31.828 --> 00:49:33.879
We're at the library right now, Bong Gu.

729
00:49:33.879 --> 00:49:35.958
I'd like to get my finger pricked too.

730
00:49:35.958 --> 00:49:38.891
Pricked with a needle? Why?

731
00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:39.969
I have indigestion.

732
00:49:39.969 --> 00:49:42.208
Then, take some indigestion medication.

733
00:49:42.208 --> 00:49:44.759
It's just a folk remedy
that has no effect.

734
00:49:44.759 --> 00:49:46.520
It works well for me.

735
00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.741
You've had it done before? When?

736
00:49:50.739 --> 00:49:52.147
I have really bad indigestion.

737
00:49:52.147 --> 00:49:54.074
Does the finger pricking really work?

738
00:49:56.277 --> 00:49:58.237
Do you want my Grandma to do it for you?

739
00:49:58.237 --> 00:50:02.076
She was going the hospice.
I will call the office.

740
00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:06.319
Oh dear.

741
00:50:08.167 --> 00:50:10.156
You're just skin and bones.

742
00:50:10.156 --> 00:50:14.085
What did you eat that upset your stomach?

743
00:50:14.085 --> 00:50:15.935
Grandma, be gentle.

744
00:50:15.935 --> 00:50:18.534
Bom is anemic, so we need to be careful.

745
00:50:18.534 --> 00:50:22.074
What did you two eat together
that has made you both feel like this?

746
00:50:29.833 --> 00:50:33.333
Shi Kyung, massage her other hand.

747
00:50:33.333 --> 00:50:34.366
Oh my.

748
00:50:34.366 --> 00:50:38.377
What has clogged you up?

749
00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:48.817
A person's hands and feet
need to be warm.

750
00:50:53.447 --> 00:50:57.060
You have to massage it well
to increase blood flow.

751
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.527
It's as if you're doing nothing at all.

752
00:51:15.998 --> 00:51:18.348
Isn't your grandma going home with you?

753
00:51:18.348 --> 00:51:20.116
Ga Ram's dad is driving her home.

754
00:51:22.118 --> 00:51:24.658
Are you really okay?

755
00:51:24.658 --> 00:51:27.094
Yes, I feel completely better.

756
00:51:27.094 --> 00:51:28.605
That's weird.

757
00:51:28.605 --> 00:51:31.527
It doesn't work for me,
so why does it work for you?

758
00:51:32.804 --> 00:51:35.286
Ah, you remember tomorrow?
The night fishing?

759
00:51:35.795 --> 00:51:37.045
I know.

760
00:51:38.355 --> 00:51:40.152
I'm getting all nervous.

761
00:51:41.125 --> 00:51:43.487
You should be nervous to meet my dad.

762
00:51:43.487 --> 00:51:45.795
He won't ask about my grades, will he?

763
00:51:47.085 --> 00:51:48.536
My dad...

764
00:51:49.917 --> 00:51:51.569
will like you.

765
00:51:51.569 --> 00:51:52.971
Why?

766
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:56.362
He always likes everyone I like.

767
00:52:06.141 --> 00:52:09.125
You should go inside and study.
It's cold in the morning.

768
00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:11.192
Do you have the key to this place?

769
00:52:11.192 --> 00:52:12.274
Yes.

770
00:52:14.645 --> 00:52:16.393
Can't you open it earlier?

771
00:52:16.393 --> 00:52:20.415
Why would they leave the key
with a high school student?

772
00:52:20.415 --> 00:52:23.169
Who's in charge of this place?
Isn't this irresponsible?

773
00:52:25.759 --> 00:52:27.940
I requested it for the duration
of my exam period.

774
00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.268
Almost no one ever comes here.

775
00:52:30.268 --> 00:52:33.504
Who manages this place?
Give me his number.

776
00:52:37.044 --> 00:52:39.509
Here's some warm tea and a blanket.

777
00:52:39.509 --> 00:52:41.687
The person in charge will call you later.

778
00:52:51.583 --> 00:52:53.255
Yes, hello?

779
00:52:53.255 --> 00:52:54.623
So what are you trying to say?

780
00:52:55.989 --> 00:52:57.821
I'll take care of it.

781
00:52:57.821 --> 00:53:00.763
I won't ask you to pay off
my school loans, Father.

782
00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:03.971
Why wouldn't I be able to earn money?

783
00:53:03.971 --> 00:53:05.922
I'm even selling exam questions...

784
00:53:09.194 --> 00:53:12.464
Anyway, I'll take care of it.
Don't call me again.

785
00:53:13.505 --> 00:53:15.944
Just consider me already dead!

786
