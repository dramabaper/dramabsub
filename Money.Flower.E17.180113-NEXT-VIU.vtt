00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.574
(Episode 17)

2
00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:07.964
Where's Ha Jung?

3
00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:10.694
He's sleeping inside.

4
00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:22.845
Hello, Director Jang.

5
00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:24.914
Hello. Please take the child.

6
00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.285
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:31.884
What are you doing?

8
00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:38.194
I'm just asking her to keep an eye on him.

9
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.065
If we raise our voices,

10
00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:42.834
he might be scared.

11
00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.005
I heard...

12
00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:29.014
Pil Joo brought you here,

13
00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:31.944
so you can make your own decision about the press conference.

14
00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:36.384
Did you make up your mind yet?

15
00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:39.685
Not yet.

16
00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:42.954
What are you hesitating about?

17
00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:46.394
About what I will say there.

18
00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.764
What I should tell the press to hurt...

19
00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:53.965
you and Executive Jung.

20
00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.444
I'm hesitating because I can't come up with what to say.

21
00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:47.854
For the sake of Ha Jung.

22
00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:58.104
Seo Won.

23
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:02.775
I let you slide for the sake of Ha Jung...

24
00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.375
since you're his mother.

25
00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:17.585
It's a one-time deal.

26
00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.124
And you...

27
00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:26.424
used it just now.

28
00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:30.135
Boo Cheon.

29
00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:43.544
Now,

30
00:04:44.044 --> 00:04:45.184
there is...

31
00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:46.845
a reason...

32
00:04:49.614 --> 00:04:52.385
I must be the chairman even if it costs my life.

33
00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.994
I must become the chairman as if my life depends on it.

34
00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:03.364
I don't have to keep...

35
00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:09.775
those, who stand in my way, alive.

36
00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:15.044
Seo Won.

37
00:05:19.484 --> 00:05:21.414
If I begged you this much,

38
00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.184
shouldn't it be enough?

39
00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:39.405
Must I...

40
00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:43.335
beg more than this?

41
00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:05.095
If you eliminated Yoon Seo Won that time,

42
00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:07.734
she wouldn't have been able to cause trouble.

43
00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:10.664
What if that lowlife holds the press conference...

44
00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:13.004
and ruins Boo Cheon? What will you do then?

45
00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:20.004
You only caused our son to injure his leg.

46
00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:21.814
Secretary Oh, do you know that...

47
00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:24.414
you're only harming Boo Cheon?

48
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.494
Kang Pil Joo isn't answering my call.

49
00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:39.965
Bring him to me.

50
00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:13.564
Ms. Na.

51
00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:49.765
It's eventually back...

52
00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.265
to the original owner after 20 years.

53
00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:56.905
This is the only thing...

54
00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.674
my dad left to me.

55
00:08:03.645 --> 00:08:04.914
Thank you, Ms. Na.

56
00:08:07.484 --> 00:08:08.585
You're welcome,

57
00:08:09.885 --> 00:08:11.124
Mr. Jang Eun Cheon.

58
00:08:26.604 --> 00:08:28.135
Ms. Icheon...

59
00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:31.075
recognized that necklace.

60
00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:36.915
She said Grandfather gave it to Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man.

61
00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:44.425
I thought you were Jo In Ho,

62
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:47.854
but you were Kang Pil Joo.

63
00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:52.695
Then I thought you were Kang Pil Joo,

64
00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:59.234
but you are Jang Eun Cheon.

65
00:09:09.874 --> 00:09:11.315
Kang Pil Joo's memorial service.

66
00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:17.884
I saw you having a memorial service...

67
00:09:18.784 --> 00:09:21.455
with a name plaque for Kang Pil Joo.

68
00:09:26.124 --> 00:09:29.234
When I saw you having the service with your own name plaque,

69
00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:31.935
I thought about what made you...

70
00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:34.874
walk into the river when you were young.

71
00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:39.244
It must have been something...

72
00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:43.514
terrible and despicable I can't even fathom.

73
00:09:45.644 --> 00:09:47.455
And it's not over yet.

74
00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:52.124
That's what I thought.

75
00:09:57.624 --> 00:10:00.024
I'll take back what I said...

76
00:10:01.864 --> 00:10:03.134
about you living happy.

77
00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:09.435
No matter what you say,

78
00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:12.945
when you can't use your real name,

79
00:10:14.945 --> 00:10:16.845
you're not living well.

80
00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:23.784
I need to know...

81
00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:29.825
me, Boo Cheon, and you...

82
00:10:32.624 --> 00:10:33.795
How three of us...

83
00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:37.264
got here.

84
00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:39.565
And why you are...

85
00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:43.935
hiding your real name...

86
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.004
and living in Cheon A.

87
00:10:52.884 --> 00:10:54.555
I believe I have the right...

88
00:10:56.854 --> 00:10:58.185
to ask you.

89
00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.234
I'll tell you,

90
00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:18.774
but...

91
00:11:21.345 --> 00:11:23.114
if you want to hear my story,

92
00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:27.014
you have to be ready for it.

93
00:11:29.384 --> 00:11:31.254
You need to be ready...

94
00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:35.595
to hear...

95
00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.225
anything I have to say.

96
00:11:43.095 --> 00:11:45.665
Come back when you're ready.

97
00:11:47.234 --> 00:11:48.604
I am...

98
00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.075
ready for it.

99
00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:54.744
So...

100
00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:57.685
tell me.

101
00:12:07.384 --> 00:12:08.394
Attorney Kang.

102
00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:18.065
You need to see Executive Jung now.

103
00:12:18.364 --> 00:12:20.805
She said she called you several times, but you didn't pick up.

104
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.555
Have you found Yoon Seo Won, that witch?

105
00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:44.864
Yes. Boo Cheon's on his way to meet her.

106
00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:47.634
You sent him alone?

107
00:12:48.764 --> 00:12:51.165
He doesn't know anything. What's he going to do?

108
00:12:51.734 --> 00:12:53.134
No one can...

109
00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.835
communicate with her better than him.

110
00:12:56.305 --> 00:12:58.675
They even have a child.

111
00:12:58.874 --> 00:13:02.445
I didn't ask how well they get along.

112
00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:04.644
That's not the point.

113
00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:06.715
We need to prevent Yoon Seo Won from talking.

114
00:13:09.114 --> 00:13:10.114
Gosh.

115
00:13:10.784 --> 00:13:11.784
(Boo Cheon)

116
00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.624
The number you have dialed isn't available at the moment...

117
00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:19.165
There's...

118
00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:22.994
not one man I like in Mooshimwon.

119
00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:52.254
The number you have dialed...

120
00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:54.024
isn't available at the moment...

121
00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:57.154
He's still not picking up.

122
00:14:58.095 --> 00:14:59.595
Something must've happened.

123
00:15:19.845 --> 00:15:20.854
Mom.

124
00:15:21.784 --> 00:15:23.415
Seo Won will not have...

125
00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:26.754
<v ->a press conference. - Really?</v>

126
00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:30.654
Did you talk her through?

127
00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.095
What did you say to change her mind?

128
00:15:35.494 --> 00:15:37.604
I tried my best to beg her.

129
00:15:38.935 --> 00:15:40.335
Then she said she won't do it.

130
00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:43.305
Good job, Boo Cheon.

131
00:15:44.874 --> 00:15:46.075
Of course.

132
00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:48.144
I'll become the chairman.

133
00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:50.675
That's nothing.

134
00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:56.284
We should still lock her up for a while.

135
00:15:56.354 --> 00:15:59.425
Mom. I've settled it.

136
00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:03.055
Trust your son.

137
00:16:03.354 --> 00:16:04.725
Gosh, Mom.

138
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.634
Sure.

139
00:16:10.734 --> 00:16:12.364
I'll trust you...

140
00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.205
since you're so certain.

141
00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:19.244
You two should go sleep.

142
00:16:33.524 --> 00:16:34.524
Hey.

143
00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:36.955
That knife...

144
00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:42.534
I needed it to beg Seo Won.

145
00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:47.774
I've put it back to its place.

146
00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.604
Don't blame me later if it goes missing.

147
00:16:53.774 --> 00:16:54.874
Let's go to sleep.

148
00:16:56.244 --> 00:16:57.984
You can relax, Mom.

149
00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:06.984
Pil Joo.

150
00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:09.324
Did Boo Cheon just...

151
00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:21.935
(Yoon Seo Won)

152
00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.744
Yoon Seo Won's in Cheong A Hotel.

153
00:17:34.014 --> 00:17:35.254
She's not answering her phone.

154
00:17:35.415 --> 00:17:37.855
She must be sleeping. Do you know what time it is?

155
00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:03.344
Yoon Seo Won.

156
00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.685
Yoon Seo Won.

157
00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:41.554
(Mooshimwon)

158
00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.554
Did it work out?

159
00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:53.665
That's a relief. I knew it.

160
00:18:53.794 --> 00:18:57.435
She was just angry. She didn't really...

161
00:18:57.905 --> 00:19:00.365
You should say hello if you're here.

162
00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:25.764
Here.

163
00:19:34.034 --> 00:19:36.004
I've used it since the day...

164
00:19:36.004 --> 00:19:38.605
I started Cheong A business.

165
00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:40.105
Grandfather.

166
00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:43.244
I told him that you'd prefer...

167
00:19:43.244 --> 00:19:46.244
receiving the shares or cash.

168
00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:49.715
But he wanted to give it to you,

169
00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:52.355
so he took it out a few days ago.

170
00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:55.324
He even asked me to apply the lubricant on it...

171
00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:57.925
and treat it as if it were a baby...

172
00:19:57.925 --> 00:19:59.425
so that its beads won't fall off.

173
00:19:59.425 --> 00:20:02.465
He was such a demanding man.

174
00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:04.734
Are you disappointed that it's not the shares?

175
00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:07.304
I am not, Grandfather.

176
00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:09.574
I like it better than the shares.

177
00:20:10.844 --> 00:20:13.244
Of course, I would've been happier if you gave me the shares too.

178
00:20:13.244 --> 00:20:17.314
Look, this little boy now has grown into a decent man.

179
00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:19.915
You're much better than your dad.

180
00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:24.425
Sir, there's one more thing you should tell him.

181
00:20:24.584 --> 00:20:26.324
<v ->What? - You used the abacus...</v>

182
00:20:26.324 --> 00:20:28.925
in front of the customers...

183
00:20:28.925 --> 00:20:30.524
just not to incur their suspicion.

184
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:32.665
But you were already done...

185
00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:35.264
calculating the prices in your head.

186
00:20:35.635 --> 00:20:36.895
That's right.

187
00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:40.564
I could do sums in my head faster than using it.

188
00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:42.605
You're still the one...

189
00:20:42.605 --> 00:20:44.744
who reads Cheong A's financial statements the fastest.

190
00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.774
That's the vital aspect required for businessmen.

191
00:20:47.175 --> 00:20:50.514
You need to know what would bring you the most profit quickly...

192
00:20:50.544 --> 00:20:53.185
and then pretend not to know anything...

193
00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:54.355
with a poker face.

194
00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:55.784
With a poker face!

195
00:20:57.455 --> 00:20:58.554
I got it.

196
00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:00.554
I'll keep that it mind.

197
00:21:00.554 --> 00:21:03.455
I opened Cheong A business when I was 19,

198
00:21:03.455 --> 00:21:05.824
so I guess the abacus is about 60 years old, right?

199
00:21:05.824 --> 00:21:07.395
It'd be around 70 years old.

200
00:21:07.395 --> 00:21:08.764
Really?

201
00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.334
I guess I want to rejuvenate myself...

202
00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:13.205
since I often believe I'm younger than I really am.

203
00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:19.105
Then Ha Jung will...

204
00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:23.074
lose his chance to become the member of the Jang family.

205
00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.215
Boo Cheon begged me.

206
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.324
Call off Yoon Seo Won's press conference.

207
00:21:37.564 --> 00:21:38.594
Yes, sir.

208
00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:57.544
I didn't even know about its existence.

209
00:21:57.544 --> 00:21:58.615
Grandfather...

210
00:21:59.014 --> 00:22:02.185
only showed it to Dad just once and kept it until today.

211
00:22:02.554 --> 00:22:03.984
And he gave it to me.

212
00:22:05.885 --> 00:22:09.094
Attorney Kang and Director Jang have just got out of the hospital.

213
00:22:09.455 --> 00:22:11.195
What would invigorate them?

214
00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:13.965
What about Master Kwon's herbal tonic?

215
00:22:17.435 --> 00:22:20.304
Ms. Na should have some more.

216
00:22:21.034 --> 00:22:22.074
I'm all right.

217
00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.605
Mother, I don't need it.

218
00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:26.945
You need it, so you can conceive a baby.

219
00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.215
Director Jang even gave...

220
00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:31.344
Ms. Na the family treasure.

221
00:22:32.244 --> 00:22:34.855
Why don't you make Honorary Chairman Jan happy...

222
00:22:34.855 --> 00:22:36.185
by giving birth to a baby boy?

223
00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:37.925
Family treasure?

224
00:22:38.054 --> 00:22:41.494
I mean the necklace that the late vice chairman Jang had.

225
00:22:46.094 --> 00:22:49.395
The necklace Honorary Chairman made himself...

226
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:51.804
after winning some kind of bid for construction...

227
00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:55.274
when the vice chairman was little.

228
00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:00.074
I have never seen it.

229
00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:05.314
Then I'm sure Honorary Chairman Jang gave it to you.

230
00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:07.385
I just found it somewhere else.

231
00:23:07.784 --> 00:23:08.855
Really?

232
00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:11.984
But it looked the same.

233
00:23:11.984 --> 00:23:13.225
I know what it looks like.

234
00:23:14.254 --> 00:23:16.594
Bring it here. I need to see it.

235
00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:18.764
Yes, Mother.

236
00:23:38.115 --> 00:23:40.885
It's inside the bottom drawer left to the desk.

237
00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:12.084
I found the place for Seo Won and Ha Jung to stay.

238
00:24:12.445 --> 00:24:15.814
We need to estrange them from Boo Cheon for a while.

239
00:24:15.915 --> 00:24:18.984
Finally, you have control over Yoon Seo Won.

240
00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:25.665
Why do you always cover up for her?

241
00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:29.064
There's no reason for it, Executive Jung.

242
00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:30.494
You never do anything...

243
00:24:31.264 --> 00:24:33.135
without a reason.

244
00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.334
I guess that means you can't tell me why.

245
00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:40.975
Fine. I will stop asking why.

246
00:24:42.774 --> 00:24:46.544
Boo Cheon could've changed so much thanks to your encouragement,

247
00:24:46.744 --> 00:24:47.984
which is really good.

248
00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:51.855
Both Boo Cheon and I think this would be the last chance.

249
00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:56.024
Cheong A is currently under attack from others.

250
00:24:56.324 --> 00:24:59.195
He thinks there would be no such chance later,

251
00:24:59.294 --> 00:25:01.465
so he's been nervous a lot,

252
00:25:02.135 --> 00:25:05.405
which I believe to be helpful for Boo Cheon.

253
00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:08.135
I see.

254
00:25:44.344 --> 00:25:47.205
Where did you find it?

255
00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:48.544
I went to a retreat...

256
00:25:48.844 --> 00:25:51.145
and found it near the river when I was young.

257
00:25:51.645 --> 00:25:53.844
Where? Which river?

258
00:25:54.314 --> 00:25:56.855
It was near the retreat center in Gapyeong.

259
00:26:02.824 --> 00:26:03.955
Leave it here.

260
00:26:08.395 --> 00:26:09.895
It's not yours.

261
00:26:10.665 --> 00:26:12.465
Do you cherish it now?

262
00:26:19.504 --> 00:26:22.074
This belong to the Jangs,

263
00:26:23.044 --> 00:26:24.544
specifically to my husband.

264
00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:26.514
Let me make it clear...

265
00:26:27.115 --> 00:26:28.584
that it's mine, Mo Hyun.

266
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:35.994
I'll give it to you when you give birth to a baby.

267
00:26:40.294 --> 00:26:41.494
You may leave.

268
00:26:45.034 --> 00:26:46.064
Okay.

269
00:26:55.915 --> 00:26:56.975
This necklace is...

270
00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:00.344
the late Eun Cheon's.

271
00:27:04.484 --> 00:27:06.655
He put it inside a frame and treasured it,

272
00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:09.655
saying it was from his father.

273
00:27:10.094 --> 00:27:11.465
And one day, he took it out...

274
00:27:12.195 --> 00:27:14.195
and put it around Eun Cheon's neck.

275
00:27:16.564 --> 00:27:18.734
It must've be given to Boo Cheon.

276
00:27:25.405 --> 00:27:26.875
It's so strange.

277
00:27:27.774 --> 00:27:29.215
How could it fall...

278
00:27:30.514 --> 00:27:32.514
into Mo Hyun's hands?

279
00:27:36.084 --> 00:27:38.824
We not only failed to get the permit to build Cheong A Tower,

280
00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:41.355
but also Boo Cheon's father-in-law failed to become the president.

281
00:27:42.195 --> 00:27:43.225
Since...

282
00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:46.165
Mo Hyun became our family,

283
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.234
nothing has gone well at all.

284
00:27:49.264 --> 00:27:51.165
During the five years of Lee Cheol Yong's presidency,

285
00:27:51.264 --> 00:27:53.534
Cheong A has earned a great deal of profits...

286
00:27:53.734 --> 00:27:56.635
thanks to Congressman Na's lobbying.

287
00:27:58.405 --> 00:28:00.915
And because of the profit we gained during the current administration,

288
00:28:01.074 --> 00:28:04.514
the next government is paying attention to us.

289
00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:08.784
Pil Joo,

290
00:28:10.314 --> 00:28:13.425
you always take Mo Hyun's side whenever we talk about her,

291
00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:16.655
and that's awfully unpleasant.

292
00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:22.665
You're not working for her sake.

293
00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:24.665
Come to yourself,

294
00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:26.304
Pil Joo.

295
00:28:32.804 --> 00:28:34.544
Out of nine candidates for the vice chairman,

296
00:28:34.544 --> 00:28:37.484
we've narrowed down to five candidates...

297
00:28:37.484 --> 00:28:40.284
including Vice President Jang and Director Jang.

298
00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:41.754
Here it is.

299
00:28:43.514 --> 00:28:46.054
The presidents selected the candidates.

300
00:28:46.484 --> 00:28:48.024
I am sure...

301
00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:51.425
all of them are qualified enough as you chose them.

302
00:28:51.994 --> 00:28:53.264
I never doubt it.

303
00:28:53.794 --> 00:28:56.594
As long as it's motivated Boo Cheon and Yeo Cheon, it's good.

304
00:28:59.234 --> 00:29:02.074
Then let's narrow down to Boo Cheon and Yeo Cheon...

305
00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:04.445
and brief me on them.

306
00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:06.405
As you all know,

307
00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:09.014
the new treatment Director Jang developed...

308
00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:10.675
successfully garnered the media's attention.

309
00:29:13.115 --> 00:29:15.314
However, Vice President Jang Yeo Cheon...

310
00:29:15.314 --> 00:29:17.784
violated Director Jang Boo Cheon's privacy...

311
00:29:17.784 --> 00:29:18.955
Mr. Woo.

312
00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.324
That's enough.

313
00:29:22.955 --> 00:29:25.865
But I'm obliged to report it...

314
00:29:25.994 --> 00:29:28.365
as the head of the personnel committee.

315
00:29:28.895 --> 00:29:29.965
Attorney Kang.

316
00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:33.605
Mr. Woo, it's all over already. You don't need to report it.

317
00:29:33.734 --> 00:29:35.834
How come there's something I do not know?

318
00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:39.044
Attorney Kang, how dare you treat me...

319
00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:40.814
like a lame duck?

320
00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:42.074
I apologize, sir.

321
00:29:43.344 --> 00:29:46.814
Director Jang Boo Cheon took care of it,

322
00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:48.655
so I didn't inform you.

323
00:29:48.715 --> 00:29:49.885
Tell me now.

324
00:29:51.155 --> 00:29:54.254
Director Jang Yeo Cheon appeased the mother of Yoon Ha Jung,

325
00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:55.994
the child you met a while ago,

326
00:29:56.794 --> 00:29:59.324
with the promise that he'd support her with a suit against...

327
00:29:59.895 --> 00:30:02.264
Director Jang Boo Cheon regarding the paternity...

328
00:30:02.435 --> 00:30:04.764
of the child if she holds a press conference.

329
00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:06.504
However,

330
00:30:07.534 --> 00:30:08.774
the purpose of the press conference...

331
00:30:09.504 --> 00:30:12.744
was to mar the reputation of Director Jang Boo Cheon, sir.

332
00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:16.475
Yeo Cheon.

333
00:30:17.014 --> 00:30:20.445
You are disrupting everything that brings profits to me.

334
00:30:20.584 --> 00:30:22.484
<v ->Grandfather. - Yeo Cheon...</v>

335
00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:24.425
will exempted from the potential vice chairman list.

336
00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:28.225
<v ->Yes, sir. - And Yeo Cheon.</v>

337
00:30:28.824 --> 00:30:29.824
Yes, Grandfather.

338
00:30:29.824 --> 00:30:32.165
You will be able to control your mind better...

339
00:30:32.165 --> 00:30:33.725
once you work on cutting down the trees in Myanmar.

340
00:30:34.494 --> 00:30:36.695
<v ->Work there for two years. - Grandfather.</v>

341
00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:51.719
&lt;font color="#80ffff"&gt;[VIU Ver] E17 Money Flower "Cheong A's Dog"&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color="#ff00ff"&gt;-= Ruo Xi =-&lt;/font&gt;

342
00:31:01.494 --> 00:31:03.824
Why didn't you tell Grandfather that...

343
00:31:04.494 --> 00:31:06.564
Yeo Cheon tried to get Seo Won to hold a press conference?

344
00:31:09.365 --> 00:31:11.635
Yeo Cheon doesn't live at Mooshimwon.

345
00:31:13.365 --> 00:31:16.534
Yeo Cheon had to be present when I told him about it,

346
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.645
so your grandfather could get angrier...

347
00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:21.915
seeing Yeo Cheon sitting in front of him.

348
00:31:22.744 --> 00:31:25.984
That's how we can get rid of him faster.

349
00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:28.915
So...

350
00:31:30.685 --> 00:31:33.625
to get rid of him with one blow, Mr. Woo set up the stage,

351
00:31:34.395 --> 00:31:36.494
you danced on the stage while pretending to be clueless,

352
00:31:37.225 --> 00:31:38.965
and Grandfather played along with the whole act.

353
00:31:43.294 --> 00:31:45.534
Gosh, Pil Joo. Well played.

354
00:31:49.004 --> 00:31:50.074
But now that...

355
00:31:50.905 --> 00:31:53.405
Yeo Cheon is leaving to the lumber camp in Myanmar,

356
00:31:54.915 --> 00:31:56.744
I sort of feel bad for him.

357
00:32:00.715 --> 00:32:01.754
Boo Cheon.

358
00:32:08.254 --> 00:32:09.254
Jang Boo Cheon.

359
00:32:11.564 --> 00:32:13.365
You didn't win yet.

360
00:32:16.465 --> 00:32:19.465
You don't have time to wallow in your feelings.

361
00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.175
If Jang Yeo Cheon...

362
00:32:22.175 --> 00:32:23.375
stays next to you,

363
00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:25.804
he will try to take you down whenever he gets a chance.

364
00:32:26.645 --> 00:32:28.475
He can steal your position from you.

365
00:32:30.784 --> 00:32:31.885
Keep that in mind.

366
00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:34.355
Okay?

367
00:32:40.084 --> 00:32:41.125
Okay.

368
00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:43.294
I got it.

369
00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:48.865
Hey.

370
00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:51.205
Just punch me.

371
00:32:52.034 --> 00:32:53.064
You...

372
00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:56.534
Do you know how scary you look when you shoot daggers at me?

373
00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:03.875
You wouldn't know. You've never looked at your own eyes.

374
00:33:16.824 --> 00:33:18.294
Are you here to say goodbye?

375
00:33:20.324 --> 00:33:21.494
There's no need for that.

376
00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:25.034
I'm not a fan of you,

377
00:33:25.534 --> 00:33:27.435
but since we share the lineage,

378
00:33:28.004 --> 00:33:30.274
chalk it up to our lineage, and let me give you a word of advice.

379
00:33:31.574 --> 00:33:33.905
I guess today is my day of receiving advice.

380
00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:36.645
Why does everyone who has a mouth around me...

381
00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:38.645
want to give a word of advice?

382
00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:40.715
Every advice, but mine, doesn't mean anything.

383
00:33:41.054 --> 00:33:43.814
This advice from your competitor is real.

384
00:33:45.925 --> 00:33:47.385
Be careful with Kang Pil Joo.

385
00:33:48.494 --> 00:33:50.195
He can push you away anytime...

386
00:33:50.254 --> 00:33:51.895
and take your place.

387
00:33:52.064 --> 00:33:53.125
Hey, punk.

388
00:33:53.695 --> 00:33:57.234
Didn't you hear how Pil Joo addressed me as his "owner"?

389
00:33:57.865 --> 00:33:59.665
How dare you cause a rift between us?

390
00:34:01.804 --> 00:34:02.975
How naive.

391
00:34:03.905 --> 00:34:07.244
Do you think he genuinely sees you as his superior?

392
00:34:07.415 --> 00:34:09.815
Hey, get out. These days,

393
00:34:10.844 --> 00:34:12.415
I'm working on my reputation.

394
00:34:13.045 --> 00:34:15.485
Count yourself lucky that I'm not beating you up. Get lost.

395
00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:20.424
I told you to get out!

396
00:34:30.964 --> 00:34:34.435
It is my opinion that the biggest mistake Aunt made...

397
00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:37.404
is keeping Kang Pil Joo next to you.

398
00:34:38.904 --> 00:34:41.514
When we were young, we used to play together all the time.

399
00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:43.475
I know enough about you.

400
00:34:45.045 --> 00:34:46.815
You're not as weak as...

401
00:34:47.415 --> 00:34:49.214
Aunt makes you out to be.

402
00:34:50.514 --> 00:34:52.025
Without Kang Pil Joo,

403
00:34:52.185 --> 00:34:54.625
you could have competed against me.

404
00:34:55.654 --> 00:34:57.025
Fair and square.

405
00:34:58.264 --> 00:35:00.565
Am I not playing fair now?

406
00:35:03.065 --> 00:35:04.105
Boo Cheon.

407
00:35:04.904 --> 00:35:07.235
You got all the way here because...

408
00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:09.574
Kang Pil Joo trained you.

409
00:35:15.145 --> 00:35:18.545
Do you really not know or are you playing dumb with me?

410
00:35:19.485 --> 00:35:22.255
<v ->You jerk. - Should I...</v>

411
00:35:23.585 --> 00:35:25.185
guess what you're thinking?

412
00:35:26.955 --> 00:35:30.225
You often think that you're lucky to have Kang Pil Joo on your side,

413
00:35:30.424 --> 00:35:31.824
don't you?

414
00:35:35.264 --> 00:35:36.264
Good luck.

415
00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:38.505
Don't let the tiger bite you.

416
00:35:38.964 --> 00:35:40.065
Survive.

417
00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.205
Please do.

418
00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.864
Get all the files...

419
00:36:12.304 --> 00:36:15.074
that you collected while tailing Ms. Na ready.

420
00:36:15.634 --> 00:36:18.844
Are you really going to tell her everything about her marriage?

421
00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:21.174
Yes, except the part Congressman Na willingly made use...

422
00:36:21.415 --> 00:36:23.014
of the support from Cheong A.

423
00:36:23.744 --> 00:36:25.315
I'll be the only one to blame.

424
00:36:25.685 --> 00:36:28.085
Ms. Na and Congressman Na...

425
00:36:28.685 --> 00:36:31.185
<v ->will be the victims. - Pil Joo.</v>

426
00:36:32.355 --> 00:36:34.255
Are you trying to make her hate you...

427
00:36:34.654 --> 00:36:36.525
and put distance from you?

428
00:36:36.525 --> 00:36:39.795
<v ->How are stocks for this quarter? - Well,</v>

429
00:36:40.994 --> 00:36:44.105
we lost the funds when President Jang Seong Man stole the truck,

430
00:36:44.534 --> 00:36:46.065
but we recovered the funds with the stocks.

431
00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.475
We had a great quarter with the stock investment.

432
00:36:48.534 --> 00:36:51.645
When Daeil Distribution goes public, we will need fund to buy shares.

433
00:36:51.804 --> 00:36:55.244
Stop purchasing stocks of Cheong A Trading for a while.

434
00:36:55.844 --> 00:36:58.915
<v ->Okay. - Buy a lot of shares from Daeil.</v>

435
00:36:59.045 --> 00:37:01.154
That's how we will have the upper hand...

436
00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:03.355
when Cheong A Bio and Cheong A Trading merge.

437
00:37:03.355 --> 00:37:05.284
But Cheong A Trading is a bigger company.

438
00:37:05.855 --> 00:37:08.654
Even the merging ratio will be advantageous for Cheong A Trading.

439
00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:11.625
For now, yes. But keep your tabs on it.

440
00:37:12.165 --> 00:37:14.594
It's a matter of time for Cheong A Bio to take over Cheong A Trading.

441
00:37:16.864 --> 00:37:18.534
With the money from Executive Jung,

442
00:37:18.665 --> 00:37:21.505
buy shares of Cheong A Trading. With our money,

443
00:37:21.735 --> 00:37:24.005
only buy shares of Cheong A Bio which is undervalued.

444
00:37:24.074 --> 00:37:26.344
Buy expensive shares with Executive Jung's money.

445
00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:27.915
Cheap ones with our money.

446
00:37:29.045 --> 00:37:30.815
Okay. Got it.

447
00:37:42.355 --> 00:37:43.355
Pil Joo.

448
00:38:11.784 --> 00:38:12.784
Park Yong Goo.

449
00:38:26.034 --> 00:38:27.065
So this is...

450
00:38:28.134 --> 00:38:31.045
the headquarters where you are striving to make me...

451
00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:32.705
the chairman.

452
00:38:34.005 --> 00:38:35.145
What brings you here?

453
00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:39.514
I came here for you.

454
00:38:40.915 --> 00:38:42.085
I had some questions.

455
00:38:44.485 --> 00:38:47.355
I asked Pil Joo about this, but he didn't give me an answer.

456
00:38:47.955 --> 00:38:49.054
Pil Joo.

457
00:38:50.924 --> 00:38:52.625
Do you know what he plans to do...

458
00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.735
once I become the chairman?

459
00:38:56.034 --> 00:38:59.065
He will still work at Cheong A. When you become the chairman,

460
00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:02.034
aren't you going to promote him?

461
00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:03.404
Of course.

462
00:39:04.244 --> 00:39:05.804
I should make him the president...

463
00:39:06.674 --> 00:39:08.975
of a subsidiary or something. That's for sure.

464
00:39:11.244 --> 00:39:12.744
Help him.

465
00:39:13.344 --> 00:39:14.415
That's how...

466
00:39:15.784 --> 00:39:17.424
you can help me.

467
00:39:17.884 --> 00:39:19.455
I will return the favor later.

468
00:39:20.455 --> 00:39:21.625
Sure.

469
00:39:22.395 --> 00:39:23.455
Actually,

470
00:39:24.054 --> 00:39:27.264
time to time, I sold myself short and wondered...

471
00:39:28.565 --> 00:39:31.665
what good being the chairman of Cheong A would do for me.

472
00:39:34.804 --> 00:39:37.475
Hey, this is just between you and me.

473
00:39:38.475 --> 00:39:40.645
I didn't even want to become the chairman,

474
00:39:40.674 --> 00:39:43.244
but Pil Joo tamed and trained me.

475
00:39:44.344 --> 00:39:46.214
That's how he's been dragging me until now.

476
00:39:49.514 --> 00:39:51.554
He was just helping out as a friend.

477
00:39:52.585 --> 00:39:53.855
You are being too harsh.

478
00:39:53.855 --> 00:39:56.424
That's why I'm telling you this is between us.

479
00:39:58.364 --> 00:39:59.824
It's also true, isn't it?

480
00:40:42.534 --> 00:40:43.574
Secretary Oh.

481
00:40:45.705 --> 00:40:46.875
Were you waiting for me?

482
00:40:47.304 --> 00:40:50.475
No, I wasn't. It's not like that.

483
00:40:51.344 --> 00:40:53.284
You come home around this time,

484
00:40:53.744 --> 00:40:56.485
so I was just standing near here while I was taking a walk.

485
00:41:02.994 --> 00:41:03.994
Secretary Oh.

486
00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:05.494
Yes.

487
00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:07.565
Don't wait for me anymore.

488
00:41:08.964 --> 00:41:10.065
It's really awkward.

489
00:41:13.134 --> 00:41:14.375
Yes, sir.

490
00:41:31.955 --> 00:41:34.455
Mo Hyun said she'll be at her parents' place a little longer.

491
00:41:34.455 --> 00:41:36.395
Okay. I heard too.

492
00:41:37.424 --> 00:41:39.324
<v ->I had dinner already. - Okay.</v>

493
00:41:42.435 --> 00:41:43.694
What happened to the necklace?

494
00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:47.505
I heard I saw it correctly.

495
00:41:49.634 --> 00:41:50.634
Mom.

496
00:42:05.924 --> 00:42:06.955
I...

497
00:42:08.424 --> 00:42:11.895
know Dad had another son.

498
00:42:13.994 --> 00:42:15.134
That necklace...

499
00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:20.165
was given to Jang Eun Cheon by Dad, right?

500
00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:22.634
That's right.

501
00:42:24.205 --> 00:42:26.205
But Mo Hyun picked that up.

502
00:42:30.315 --> 00:42:31.344
Show it to me.

503
00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:33.744
Why would you want to see it?

504
00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:35.815
A dead person wore that.

505
00:42:36.915 --> 00:42:39.284
Jang Eun Cheon is dead.

506
00:42:40.924 --> 00:42:41.955
I know.

507
00:42:42.525 --> 00:42:43.694
I heard he's dead.

508
00:42:49.964 --> 00:42:51.134
But I still want to see it.

509
00:42:52.705 --> 00:42:54.735
I want to see the necklace that Dad gave to Jang Eun Cheon.

510
00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:23.094
Grandfather gave it to your dad.

511
00:43:25.404 --> 00:43:27.335
And it should've been passed to you.

512
00:43:42.815 --> 00:43:43.815
Mom.

513
00:43:45.525 --> 00:43:46.755
I want to keep it.

514
00:43:48.355 --> 00:43:49.424
Okay.

515
00:43:50.025 --> 00:43:51.525
That'd be better.

516
00:43:54.494 --> 00:43:55.835
The necklace...

517
00:43:56.235 --> 00:43:58.034
has finally found its rightful owner,

518
00:43:58.935 --> 00:44:00.134
thanks to Mo Hyun.

519
00:44:23.725 --> 00:44:24.824
Sir.

520
00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:41.975
Secretary Oh.

521
00:44:44.844 --> 00:44:45.884
You...

522
00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:48.955
went and took care...

523
00:44:50.514 --> 00:44:52.554
of Jang Eun Cheon's funeral with Pil Joo and mom, right?

524
00:44:56.494 --> 00:44:57.924
I heard it from Pil Joo.

525
00:44:58.964 --> 00:45:00.625
Yes.

526
00:45:02.895 --> 00:45:04.134
But Secretary Oh.

527
00:45:10.705 --> 00:45:11.744
Actually,

528
00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:17.014
Jang Eun Cheon is alive.

529
00:45:19.815 --> 00:45:21.514
What do you...

530
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:27.625
Kang Pil Joo...

531
00:45:29.355 --> 00:45:31.295
is Jang Eun Cheon, Secretary Oh.

532
00:45:31.994 --> 00:45:33.194
Sir.

533
00:45:36.335 --> 00:45:37.335
I...

534
00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:39.404
My mom...

535
00:45:42.235 --> 00:45:45.505
He knows how much my mom and I like him.

536
00:45:47.415 --> 00:45:49.975
We've been deceived for over 20 years.

537
00:45:54.045 --> 00:45:56.855
What grudges must he have against us?

538
00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:59.455
How could he...

539
00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.165
deceive us for such a long time?

540
00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.364
So...

541
00:46:10.295 --> 00:46:12.864
please keep an eye on Pil Joo.

542
00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.074
Okay.

543
00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:18.344
Don't tell...

544
00:46:20.145 --> 00:46:21.875
my mom about this.

545
00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:23.415
Of course.

546
00:46:24.244 --> 00:46:25.415
I won't.

547
00:46:32.525 --> 00:46:33.654
If my mom finds out...

548
00:46:37.864 --> 00:46:39.565
that Pil Joo's been deceiving her,

549
00:46:43.694 --> 00:46:45.404
she might pass away.

550
00:47:07.594 --> 00:47:09.324
When is Yeo Cheon leaving?

551
00:47:10.225 --> 00:47:13.364
Since those in Myanmar need to get ready for him,

552
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:15.065
he'll leave in about 10 days.

553
00:47:16.464 --> 00:47:19.605
So it'll take 10 more days until we finally get rid of him.

554
00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:23.275
Jang Seong Man.

555
00:47:23.935 --> 00:47:27.105
He won't come begging because he's too proud.

556
00:47:28.114 --> 00:47:31.884
He must be dying to receive a call...

557
00:47:31.884 --> 00:47:33.585
from Father.

558
00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:39.985
One more thing, Pil Joo.

559
00:47:41.855 --> 00:47:44.264
About the necklace that Mo Hyun picked up.

560
00:47:45.764 --> 00:47:49.295
Wouldn't it make more sense...

561
00:47:50.094 --> 00:47:52.964
to say Eun Cheon gave it to her...

562
00:47:53.964 --> 00:47:57.574
than saying she picked it up coincidentally at a school trip?

563
00:47:58.505 --> 00:48:00.304
Wouldn't that sound more believable?

564
00:48:02.545 --> 00:48:04.244
She kept the necklace...

565
00:48:04.344 --> 00:48:07.085
she picked up coincidentally for more than 20 years?

566
00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:09.755
It's better...

567
00:48:10.355 --> 00:48:12.355
to say that there's something...

568
00:48:13.324 --> 00:48:15.755
between Jang Eun Cheon and Na Mo Hyun.

569
00:48:18.525 --> 00:48:19.694
Earlier,

570
00:48:20.225 --> 00:48:22.634
she seemed attached...

571
00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:25.505
to the necklace...

572
00:48:26.264 --> 00:48:28.574
when I said that I'll keep it.

573
00:48:31.505 --> 00:48:34.714
It was also near Gapyeong...

574
00:48:35.114 --> 00:48:38.214
where Ahn Ho Kyung jumped into the water with his two sons.

575
00:48:39.415 --> 00:48:40.514
Mo Hyun...

576
00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:42.685
picked up Jang Eun Cheon's necklace...

577
00:48:43.884 --> 00:48:47.795
during her school trip near Gapyeong.

578
00:48:53.924 --> 00:48:54.964
Wait.

579
00:48:56.694 --> 00:48:58.304
Pil Joo, your house...

580
00:48:59.034 --> 00:49:00.304
is also in Gapyeong.

581
00:49:23.194 --> 00:49:24.565
Gosh, this feels good.

582
00:49:24.565 --> 00:49:26.665
You did a great job today.

583
00:49:26.665 --> 00:49:29.235
I was so busy today.

584
00:49:29.235 --> 00:49:31.065
I didn't have much time to sit down.

585
00:49:31.065 --> 00:49:32.735
Selling food...

586
00:49:33.205 --> 00:49:36.475
is getting money from others' pockets.

587
00:49:36.775 --> 00:49:38.944
It's the most difficult...

588
00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:40.744
and noble task.

589
00:49:41.014 --> 00:49:42.214
Of course, you're tired.

590
00:49:42.415 --> 00:49:43.545
It's noble.

591
00:49:43.545 --> 00:49:46.315
I always keep what you said in mind,

592
00:49:46.384 --> 00:49:47.614
and when there are guests,

593
00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:51.284
I serve them as if they're...

594
00:49:51.485 --> 00:49:53.154
my late parents.

595
00:49:53.554 --> 00:49:55.054
That's a good attitude.

596
00:49:58.395 --> 00:49:59.395
Oh, it's nice.

597
00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:11.744
Father. It's us.

598
00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:17.685
(Mooshimwon)

599
00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:33.525
Keep the conversation between Seong Man and me...

600
00:50:33.694 --> 00:50:35.194
well.

601
00:50:35.194 --> 00:50:37.735
Yes, sir. I'll record it.

602
00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:44.174
Father. We don't need an attorney...

603
00:50:44.505 --> 00:50:46.444
for the family matter.

604
00:50:46.444 --> 00:50:48.645
You still have a far way to go.

605
00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:51.045
This isn't a family matter.

606
00:50:51.645 --> 00:50:53.315
You're demoted to the lumber camp...

607
00:50:53.315 --> 00:50:55.315
as a punishment for harming Cheong A.

608
00:50:57.585 --> 00:50:59.955
What do you want to nitpick at?

609
00:50:59.955 --> 00:51:01.225
Don't be like that.

610
00:51:01.955 --> 00:51:03.654
I'm here to apologize.

611
00:51:22.514 --> 00:51:23.514
Father.

612
00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:25.714
I...

613
00:51:26.384 --> 00:51:28.955
will back off,

614
00:51:30.685 --> 00:51:33.054
but please forgive Yeo Cheon.

615
00:51:35.554 --> 00:51:39.194
This won't solve anything.

616
00:51:39.725 --> 00:51:42.665
Attorney Kang. Why don't you stay mutual...

617
00:51:43.134 --> 00:51:45.005
and suggest a plan for Cheong A?

618
00:51:45.705 --> 00:51:49.735
It's cost a lot of money and time...

619
00:51:50.005 --> 00:51:52.145
to prevent the public from knowing...

620
00:51:52.645 --> 00:51:55.074
what Director Jang Yeo Cheon has done wrong.

621
00:51:56.145 --> 00:51:59.344
Many people say his relegation...

622
00:51:59.915 --> 00:52:02.784
has set a good example to management.

623
00:52:03.455 --> 00:52:04.554
If...

624
00:52:04.924 --> 00:52:07.694
his relegation is canceled,

625
00:52:08.554 --> 00:52:10.594
I believe it is an action against...

626
00:52:10.725 --> 00:52:12.594
Honorary Chairman's belief...

627
00:52:12.964 --> 00:52:15.194
of making anyone who harms Cheong A...

628
00:52:15.264 --> 00:52:17.065
take responsibility.

629
00:52:22.074 --> 00:52:24.444
<v ->Yeo Cheon. - Yes, Grandfather.</v>

630
00:52:24.705 --> 00:52:27.145
It's against my belief.

631
00:52:27.475 --> 00:52:28.744
I can't take it back.

632
00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:31.485
Go work at the lumber camp.

633
00:52:45.964 --> 00:52:46.964
How did...

634
00:52:48.264 --> 00:52:49.264
three of us...

635
00:52:51.205 --> 00:52:53.835
get on the wrong path?

636
00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:00.674
It's your turn to answer me now.

637
00:53:22.935 --> 00:53:24.904
<v ->Hello? - Boo Cheon.</v>

638
00:53:25.705 --> 00:53:28.134
<v ->I'm sorry, - About what?</v>

639
00:53:28.804 --> 00:53:31.875
but I'm going to tell Ms. Na...

640
00:53:33.045 --> 00:53:35.344
that your marriage was my idea.

641
00:53:36.614 --> 00:53:37.744
I thought...

642
00:53:38.145 --> 00:53:40.714
I should tell you...

643
00:53:41.755 --> 00:53:43.585
<v ->before I tell her. - what?</v>

644
00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:46.085
Are you out of your mind?

645
00:53:47.494 --> 00:53:48.594
Don't do that.

646
00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:50.295
Hey...

647
00:53:52.694 --> 00:53:54.534
What a jerk.

648
00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:10.214
<v ->Hello, Director Kang. - Long time no see.</v>

649
00:54:12.045 --> 00:54:13.685
Where's Executive Na?

650
00:54:13.685 --> 00:54:16.255
She went out for lunch at the restaurant in front of the building.

651
00:54:18.525 --> 00:54:21.054
(Bonjuk and Bibimbap Cafe)

652
00:54:27.094 --> 00:54:28.094
Ms. Na.

653
00:54:29.594 --> 00:54:30.735
Mr. Kang.

654
00:54:32.005 --> 00:54:33.464
What are you doing here?

655
00:54:33.964 --> 00:54:35.074
Can I sit down?

656
00:54:36.005 --> 00:54:37.034
Yes.

657
00:54:42.275 --> 00:54:43.944
How is working in the foundation?

658
00:54:45.384 --> 00:54:47.585
It's not as fun as teaching,

659
00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:49.255
but I'm getting used to it.

660
00:54:49.585 --> 00:54:50.585
That's nice to hear.

661
00:54:51.654 --> 00:54:53.054
Would you like to order?

662
00:54:53.884 --> 00:54:55.924
<v ->This one please. - Yes.</v>

663
00:55:02.835 --> 00:55:04.464
(Jang Boo Cheon)

664
00:55:08.134 --> 00:55:10.174
(Boo Cheon)

665
00:55:10.634 --> 00:55:11.674
Ms. Na.

666
00:55:12.574 --> 00:55:15.074
One second.

667
00:55:18.344 --> 00:55:19.685
(Boo Cheon)

668
00:55:20.415 --> 00:55:22.654
He knows that...

669
00:55:23.585 --> 00:55:24.824
I'm here to talk to you.

670
00:55:33.094 --> 00:55:35.735
<v ->Eat. - Enjoy.</v>

671
00:57:24.404 --> 00:57:25.404
Have a seat.

672
00:57:40.725 --> 00:57:41.725
You said...

673
00:57:42.355 --> 00:57:44.694
you'll take back what you said about...

674
00:57:46.665 --> 00:57:48.235
me living well.

675
00:57:52.464 --> 00:57:53.864
After you listen to me,

676
00:57:55.174 --> 00:57:56.634
you'll regret...

677
00:57:58.145 --> 00:57:59.674
saving my life.

678
00:59:27.665 --> 00:59:28.665
Did you know...

679
00:59:30.065 --> 00:59:31.835
people call me...

680
00:59:36.904 --> 00:59:37.944
Cheong A's dog?

681
00:59:42.415 --> 00:59:44.185
My goal for Cheong A...

682
00:59:45.514 --> 00:59:46.645
is to make...

683
00:59:48.114 --> 00:59:49.315
my owner,

684
00:59:50.214 --> 00:59:52.154
Jang Boo Cheon, the chairman.

685
00:59:55.924 --> 00:59:57.725
In order for him to become the chairman,

686
00:59:59.565 --> 01:00:02.534
he has to win Honorary Chairman Jang's heart.

687
01:00:03.964 --> 01:00:06.764
Honorary Chairman Jang's lifelong dream was...

688
01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:11.804
to earn the approval for Cheong A Tower construction.

689
01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:13.475
So I thought...

690
01:00:14.145 --> 01:00:16.344
the daughter of Congressman Na Gi Chul,

691
01:00:18.085 --> 01:00:19.114
the presidential candidate,

692
01:00:19.944 --> 01:00:22.485
would be perfect...

693
01:00:23.685 --> 01:00:24.924
as Boo Cheon's match.

694
01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:28.094
So...

695
01:00:34.335 --> 01:00:35.735
it was planned...

696
01:00:40.364 --> 01:00:41.375
from the beginning...

697
01:00:43.935 --> 01:00:44.975
Right.

698
01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.304
That is correct.

699
01:00:55.514 --> 01:00:56.585
The reason I stayed around you...

700
01:00:57.384 --> 01:00:59.955
wasn't because I liked you,

701
01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:03.654
but because...

702
01:01:04.295 --> 01:01:05.625
I needed to investigate you.

703
01:01:09.494 --> 01:01:10.594
And...

704
01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:17.034
I came to have feelings for you.

705
01:01:30.085 --> 01:01:31.255
But now,

706
01:01:33.154 --> 01:01:35.324
I no longer like you.

707
01:01:40.694 --> 01:01:41.735
You met Boo Cheon,

708
01:01:42.864 --> 01:01:44.764
fell in love with him,

709
01:01:46.134 --> 01:01:47.735
and got married...

710
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.034
according to the scenario...

711
01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:52.505
I wrote.

712
01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.784
I shot the wing of the bird,

713
01:01:58.714 --> 01:01:59.915
and Boo Cheon...

714
01:02:01.014 --> 01:02:04.284
succeeded in getting close to you...

715
01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:07.824
very naturally...

716
01:02:10.154 --> 01:02:11.395
by rescuing the bird.

717
01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:12.585
What are you doing?

718
01:03:13.025 --> 01:03:14.395
Please stop!

719
01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:31.475
There was someone who must've been blamed,

720
01:03:34.614 --> 01:03:36.674
but I criticized the wrong person.

721
01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.924
Let go of my hands. Get off.

722
01:03:51.464 --> 01:03:52.594
Let go!

723
01:03:52.864 --> 01:03:53.994
Let go!

724
01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:02.775
Do you know how terrified I was...

725
01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.375
when I saved you?

726
01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.514
I was afraid to lose you.

727
01:04:16.014 --> 01:04:17.424
I was afraid to find you dead...

728
01:04:20.855 --> 01:04:22.255
when I took you out.

729
01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:28.565
I prayed...

730
01:04:30.904 --> 01:04:32.464
for strength,

731
01:04:35.435 --> 01:04:37.335
so I could save this boy.

732
01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.514
I prayed...

733
01:04:43.344 --> 01:04:44.384
and prayed...

734
01:04:45.844 --> 01:04:47.344
until you woke up.

735
01:04:49.614 --> 01:04:50.985
On the way back...

736
01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:54.255
after failing to see you again,

737
01:04:57.464 --> 01:04:59.795
I sincerely hoped...

738
01:05:02.435 --> 01:05:04.404
that you would be alive somewhere.

739
01:05:11.105 --> 01:05:12.205
I prayed...

740
01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.244
to see you again.

741
01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:24.424
You think I'd regret having saved you?

742
01:05:29.924 --> 01:05:30.924
No.

743
01:05:34.165 --> 01:05:35.594
I rather wish...

744
01:05:35.594 --> 01:05:38.005
you haven't saved me when the car was turned over.

745
01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:43.074
I must've died back then.

746
01:05:48.415 --> 01:05:49.475
Then...

747
01:05:53.214 --> 01:05:56.485
I could've died without knowing the ugly truth.

748
01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:06.685
