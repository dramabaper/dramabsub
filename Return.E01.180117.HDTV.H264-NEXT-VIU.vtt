00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:08.180
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.660
The photos you are looking at...

3
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:59.030
are of the murder scene from a townhouse in Sinwol-dong.

4
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.160
There's no sign of forced entry...

5
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.600
or sign of robbery.

6
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.371
At the time of the incident, the victim's clothes were taken off.

7
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.211
The police suspected it to be a case of rape and murder,

8
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:12.741
and the autopsy result supported their suspicion.

9
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.481
After analyzing the sperm DNA, found in the victim's body,

10
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:17.511
surprisingly,

11
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:20.821
it was discovered it belonged to the victim's lover, the defendant.

12
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:21.881
Thank you, Your Honor.

13
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.791
Counsel, please make your case.

14
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.651
My gosh, isn't that something? Don't you think he's phenomenal?

15
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:00.521
When I looked over the case file,

16
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.991
partial fingerprints were found on the crime scene.

17
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.890
The analysis of these fingerprints show that they're her neighbor's.

18
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.800
The neighbor had changed light bulbs for the victim,

19
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.531
and they often shared food with each other.

20
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.101
I've acquired other neighbors' statements to support this claim.

21
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.511
The test result shows that the DNA of the sperm,

22
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:19.441
found in the victim,

23
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:22.341
does not match with Mr. Park, the owner of these fingerprints.

24
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.950
Your Honor, that's exactly it.

25
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.650
I thought that...

26
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.620
could've been a trap which was misleading us in this case.

27
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.990
Please continue.

28
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.460
Only partial fingerprints of Mr. Park were found on the scene.

29
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.791
What could that mean?

30
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.770
Wouldn't it mean that he was trying to conceal his trace?

31
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.270
If his visit was free of any crime,

32
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.311
logically thinking, it's normal to find his prints all over her place.

33
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.541
On the day of the incident,

34
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.781
the victim was found with her clothes torn.

35
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.781
How will you explain the sperm DNA?

36
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.881
Let me approach this from a different point of view.

37
00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:06.620
According to an expert's opinion,

38
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.761
it's common for sperm to remain inside a body for up to three days.

39
00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:12.791
The defendant's statement that...

40
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.101
he and the victim made love the night before supports this.

41
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.800
The very first part you will taste...

42
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
is the gills.

43
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.841
- It's from the inside of the gills. - This is excellent.

44
00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:26.811
- Cheers. - The chewy texture is exceptional.

45
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.680
Give me the money.

46
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.721
My goodness.

47
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.351
Give us the head pieces.

48
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.791
We don't eat this part in Japan. Get it off the table.

49
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.830
They're Koreans after all.

50
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.101
The highlight of the tuna.

51
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:51.170
Dumb Koreans!

52
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.200
The tears of the tuna...

53
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.200
"Dumb Koreans"?

54
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:00.041
What?

55
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.381
You stupid Japanese.

56
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.450
He's a cop.

57
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.520
He's a cop!

58
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.951
Darn it!

59
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.500
The problem for this case...

60
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.701
lies in the initial investigation of the police.

61
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.440
The detective got too deep within his own theory...

62
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.110
and disregarded any evidence that didn't align with his theory.

63
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.581
After the ruling of the defendant's first trial,

64
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:12.781
he left a suicide note that he was wronged...

65
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:15.781
and committed suicide by hanging himself in the detention center.

(A legal TV show, Return)

67
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.231
If the police were more meticulous in verifying the evidence...

68
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:28.360
or there was a thorough consultation with an expert,

69
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.531
there wouldn't have been such a questionable verdict.

70
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.641
The family of the deceased Kim Young Geun...

71
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.411
requested a retrial, but it was denied.

72
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:41.341
What is the criteria for a court to grant a retrial?

73
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.740
The judges' authority?

74
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:48.680
I believe the law must hold a person's human rights...

75
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.851
and right to live above anything else.

76
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.060
I'd like to ask the viewers as well.

77
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.661
(Return)

78
00:05:58.661 --> 00:06:00.630
Cut! Good work, everyone!

79
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.500
(Return)

80
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.331
I think this will turn out great.

81
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.081
How many times do I have to say not to put this black chair here?

82
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.151
- It's just a rumor! A rumor! - What?

83
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.351
It's just a rumor.

84
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:28.360
What rumor?

85
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.190
That once you bite, you never let go.

86
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.990
Then you should know what you should do now.

87
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.401
But if they find out I told you, I'm dead.

88
00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:39.901
Seriously.

89
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.370
- It looks like he didn't see. - Yes, I think so.

90
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.411
Right?

91
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.880
If he saw it, he would've lost it with that temper of his.

92
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.481
She runs a wine bar in Cheongdam-dong.

93
00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:56.550
There's a rumor that he likes her,

94
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.291
and that they lived together.

95
00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.190
What's her name?

96
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.990
Ray? Ray...

97
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.320
Is it Ray?

98
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.331
It's Rachel Yum.

99
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:12.370
Rachel Yum.

100
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.170
(Moving Company)

101
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.731
I hear someone's moving into 302 today.

102
00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:44.170
Tell us what you've heard, Jin Joo.

103
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.831
All I heard...

104
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.300
was that the actress, Jang Ha Young, was turned down.

105
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.201
Jang Ha Young isn't so bad.

106
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:51.310
No, no.

107
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.240
She became popular only for her pretty face.

108
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.510
I read in the tabloids...

109
00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:01.351
that she's supporting her whole family.

110
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:05.021
Apparently, everyone in her family is living off her.

111
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.490
Someone like that... That's so beneath us.

112
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.291
Anyway, where is our town house's new resident,

113
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.630
the real new money?

114
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.630
You don't tell her these little jokes, do you?

115
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.641
I'm not that close with her.

116
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:29.880
- Do you live here? - Yes.

117
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.711
I'm moving into 302 today.

118
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.681
I see.

119
00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:38.421
So where do you live?

120
00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.191
In 401.

121
00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:41.990
Gosh, we're neighbors.

122
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:47.231
Hi.

123
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.030
You must look like your daddy.

124
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:52.171
Pardon?

125
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.770
She doesn't look like her mom, so she must look like her dad.

126
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.410
Yes.

127
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.880
See you around.

128
00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:05.681
(Gangdong Precinct)

129
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:09.951
- Spill it. - What?

130
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.091
You keep glancing at me.

131
00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:16.561
The people in the office keep doing the same.

132
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.990
What is it?

133
00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:21.431
You're not blind, so you'll find out eventually anyway.

134
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.900
You've watched the law show on TV called "Return", right?

135
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:28.540
No. I've only heard of it.

136
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.971
Your story was on it.

137
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.311
(Courthouse)

138
00:09:48.591 --> 00:09:51.160
Are you the person on the show, "Return"?

139
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:54.231
Yes, it is you.

140
00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:56.130
You look the same.

141
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.931
Do you want an autograph?

142
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:00.941
Tell me what you want. Go on.

143
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.040
What do you know? Why are you complaining about the police?

144
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.181
The Sinwol-dong case was already decided on by the court!

145
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:12.250
A person died and left behind a suicide note that he was wronged.

146
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.380
Nothing was wrong with the investigation.

147
00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:16.520
Kim Young Geun didn't have an alibi.

148
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.551
He even had a life insurance policy for his girlfriend.

149
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:22.120
Naturally, he was the beneficiary.

150
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.191
The victim was paying the premium.

151
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.961
And Kim Young Geun was unaware of it when she took out that policy.

152
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:31.530
When he found out about it...

153
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.471
and heard he'd get hundreds of thousands of dollars,

154
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:35.801
he must've had a change of heart.

155
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.270
According to the insurance agent,

156
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.811
Kim Young Geun had requested the policy to be canceled.

157
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.841
He suggested that she should get an annuity insurance instead...

158
00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:46.150
while saying that would be better for her future.

159
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:50.650
The two dead people dreamed of a future together.

160
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.360
But still, it may have been unintentional.

161
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.591
"Unintentional"?

162
00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:59.490
The cause of death was excessive bleeding from her head wound,

163
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.530
but there were bruises on her neck.

164
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.630
That means...

165
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.400
that he choked her...

166
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.841
and struck her with a blunt object while she was unconscious.

167
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:10.910
Could that be unintentional?

168
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.441
Why did you ignore the note at the crime scene?

169
00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:18.610
- That's because... - I'm not saying that...

170
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.451
Kim Young Geun is not the killer.

171
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.481
I simply believe that if a man commits suicide...

172
00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:25.051
while screaming out loud that he still wants to prove...

173
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:27.520
that he didn't kill his girlfriend...

174
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.421
even after his death, we should listen.

175
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.760
Do you have anything else to say?

176
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.841
I can't stand her.

177
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.181
Hello.

178
00:11:53.811 --> 00:11:57.721
I just moved into 302.

179
00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:00.990
It's nice to meet you.

180
00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:03.860
Sure.

181
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.030
Why is she running with her clothes off in this cold?

182
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.240
She's so vulgar.

183
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.341
The owner hasn't been coming in lately.

184
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.681
May I get her personal contact information?

185
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:27.150
If you tell me what this is about, I'll relay the message.

186
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.181
No need. I'll be back later.

187
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:46.301
I wonder why a detective came to see me.

188
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:49.071
Get to work.

189
00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:51.040
I found out what that woman does.

190
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.110
What does she do?

191
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.811
She runs a wine bar in Cheongdam-dong.

192
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.750
Oh, my gosh. A bar?

193
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.811
Yes.

194
00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:02.120
It may be big, but it's still a bar.

195
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.721
What are they thinking? How could they let in a bar owner?

196
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.490
The owner changed his mind,

197
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.620
and decided to rent it out instead of selling it.

198
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.790
That place is just bad luck.

199
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.000
She wouldn't bring men to her house or anything, would she?

200
00:13:17.701 --> 00:13:20.571
- No way. - My goodness.

201
00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:22.571
- We meet again. - Hello.

202
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.951
Who knew there was such a nice place in the town house?

203
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:32.211
This is nice.

204
00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:34.880
Hello.

205
00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.191
May I join you?

206
00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:42.490
Sorry, but as you can see, this seat is taken.

207
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.360
There are plenty of empty seats back there.

208
00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:49.201
Okay. I understand.

209
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:51.630
Then I'll see you later.

210
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.540
Is she clueless or shameless?

211
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.211
We were being blunt, but she sits close to us.

212
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:00.410
I know. Do you see what she's wearing?

213
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.311
It was worse this morning.

214
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:06.910
She must want to prove her identity with her body.

215
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:10.380
What if she has customers who are foreigners...

216
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.120
and speaks French?

217
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.620
Impossible.

218
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.660
That's right. You don't speak French, do you, Na Ra?

219
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.630
I don't speak French,

220
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:24.601
but I know you speak French when you badmouth people.

221
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.231
Here's my part of the tab.

222
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.311
Excuse me.

223
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.510
I have some good coffee at home.

224
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.010
Would you like to come over?

225
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.410
I'd love to.

226
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:43.921
- Just a minute. - Sure.

227
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.231
If you're going to speak so bluntly,

228
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.961
you should've just said you didn't like me, instead of dropping hints.

229
00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:59.530
It's wrong to hide a great body like this.

230
00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:04.370
You must be worried that I'll seduce your husbands,

231
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.971
but don't worry.

232
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:12.081
I'm not interested in men with no taste in women.

233
00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:19.191
Why don't you come to my place instead? I have some nice tea.

234
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.091
- Okay. - Let's go.

235
00:15:27.191 --> 00:15:28.260
Gosh.

236
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:29.461
Anyway,

237
00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:31.971
the women here are quite entertaining.

238
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.171
I bet they are livid right now.

239
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.610
I saw you speak French fluently.

240
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.140
I only do a little bit.

241
00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.910
- Thank you for rescuing me earlier. - It's okay.

242
00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:48.780
I was the victim of their badmouthing before.

243
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:52.721
I couldn't speak up for myself since I didn't speak any French.

244
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.520
Isn't that Frida Kahlo's?

245
00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:01.831
What do you think about it?

246
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:04.770
When this side of the wall is empty,

247
00:16:05.101 --> 00:16:07.000
this painting will definitely capture the room.

248
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.681
Here you go.

249
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.280
It seems like everyone already found out anyway.

250
00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:23.081
They are right. I do run a wine bar.

251
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:26.120
Do you have any bias against this line of work?

252
00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:27.620
Not at all.

253
00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:32.961
Most women here only spend money without having to work for it.

254
00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:35.160
Living a diligent life is great.

255
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:37.471
How sweet.

256
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.101
- What? - Your husband is one lucky man.

257
00:16:42.341 --> 00:16:44.240
He has a wife with great moral values...

258
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:46.510
and a beautiful face.

259
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.811
Thank you for your compliments.

260
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.780
You'd better get a grip!

261
00:16:56.921 --> 00:16:57.951
How could you fail at that?

262
00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:01.961
Tell Director Jo that he's dead tomorrow.

263
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160
Bye.

264
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:07.361
My gosh, he's 50 years old.

265
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:10.161
Tae Suk, did you get it?

266
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.131
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.671
The invitation for the opening party at Choi Ja Hye's law firm.

268
00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:15.701
Yes, I did.

269
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.371
The managing partner of her firm worked at my dad's legal team.

270
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.740
She has nowhere to turn, so she's trying to sign me as her client.

271
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:24.981
In Ho probably got his too, right?

272
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:30.080
Isn't it obvious? Na Ra and Choi Ja Hye trained together.

273
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.451
- Joon Hee, what about you? - Yes?

274
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.320
Yes, I got one too.

275
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.361
If so,

276
00:17:36.191 --> 00:17:38.861
why didn't she send one...

277
00:17:39.661 --> 00:17:40.731
to me?

278
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:42.961
How is that important?

279
00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:45.800
It feels terrible.

280
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.471
Hey, think about this.

281
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.471
There is a lot of corruption within private foundations.

282
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.840
Think about all the legal problems they must have.

283
00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.750
Hey, I'm not going. You can go on my behalf.

284
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.850
Pour me a glass too.

285
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.681
Are you insane? I'm not going.

286
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.451
I won't go!

287
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:13.731
Here you go. Here.

288
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:15.000
Welcome.

289
00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:19.030
My goodness. Thank you for coming, Mr. Oh Tae Suk.

290
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.431
Congratulations, Mr. Park.

291
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.371
I heard you are a partner at this law firm.

292
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.340
Well, it's nothing but a title.

293
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.441
I don't have that many shares in this business.

294
00:18:27.711 --> 00:18:29.441
Anyway, I hope you'd help our business.

295
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:31.850
If you would help us out, we would feel like...

296
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.951
- we got a thousand troops. - Hey.

297
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.020
Sure.

298
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.080
Hello, Na Ra.

299
00:18:38.621 --> 00:18:39.621
How did you get in here?

300
00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:41.691
Are you asking why I came without an invitation?

301
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.461
Come on. What ticked you off, Hak Bum?

302
00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:47.731
Wouldn't you be angry?

303
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.530
How does it make sense? How could she not send me one?

304
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.270
Hey, where is Choi Ja Hye?

305
00:18:54.641 --> 00:18:56.901
I wanted to see that patronizing face of hers.

306
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.681
Ms. Choi, let's go.

307
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.681
I'll be there. Go on.

308
00:19:21.705 --> 00:19:26.705
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E01 Return "Tell Me What You Want"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

309
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.921
You're not used to wearing heels.

310
00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:45.421
Ja Hye.

311
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.090
It's been ages, hasn't it?

312
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.121
Yes, it's been a while.

313
00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.790
I think it's been almost 10 years.

314
00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.500
Yes. I haven't seen you since training at the institute.

315
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.100
- Right. - But are you not working at all?

316
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.631
Work?

317
00:20:02.171 --> 00:20:05.671
I'm trying to recruit more attorneys while I expand our office.

318
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.580
I believe this could be a new tune in your life.

319
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.510
I appreciate the offer,

320
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:15.520
but I'm just a stay-at-home mother.

321
00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:17.990
You are a mother who passed the bar at the age of 21...

322
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:19.921
with off-the-charts grades from the institute...

323
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:23.520
and worked at a big law firm for a year.

324
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:29.361
This way.

325
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:32.100
Hey, something went in my eye.

326
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.770
- Blow on it. Come on. - Sorry?

327
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.371
No, blow it harder like this. Give it a go.

328
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.181
Why did you do that?

329
00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:45.181
I just think you're cute.

330
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:46.810
You always wear such boring clothes.

331
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.181
Now, look at you. You look pretty in this outfit.

332
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.691
Anyway, don't you ever speak of this, okay?

333
00:20:51.691 --> 00:20:53.691
- Ja Hye, shouldn't we do something? - Okay? Come downstairs now.

334
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.191
- What could we do? - Come down now.

335
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.661
We can only bring the suit when the victim comes forward...

336
00:20:57.661 --> 00:20:59.590
regarding her displeasure and humiliation.

337
00:21:04.171 --> 00:21:05.300
But still...

338
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.211
My goodness, what is that?

339
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.240
Look who's here. It's the chief director, Kang In Ho.

340
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.211
Gosh, your wife is quite the beauty.

341
00:21:19.881 --> 00:21:21.121
Thank you.

342
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.790
So you said that your wife and Choi Ja Hye studied together...

343
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:26.691
at the Judicial Research and Training Institute?

344
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.921
Yes, they did.

345
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.661
My goodness, if she studied law,

346
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.490
why did she stop practicing it?

347
00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:37.060
But there's no place better than marrying into a rich family.

348
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.201
Don't you agree?

349
00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:41.300
Seriously?

350
00:21:41.971 --> 00:21:45.240
"Seriously"? I must have offended you.

351
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.240
If I have offended you, I apologize.

352
00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:52.481
- But how did you get here? - I drove here.

353
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:55.350
I drove an expensive car that you can't afford...

354
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.280
with your stinking yearly salary.

355
00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.990
Hey, Hak Bum. That's enough. Stop it.

356
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.721
Why should I stop?

357
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.290
This jerk is trying to start a fight with me.

358
00:22:05.431 --> 00:22:07.661
Who are you?

359
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.161
Who invited you?

360
00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:11.570
I wasn't invited.

361
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.971
Why? What?

362
00:22:15.471 --> 00:22:18.371
Aren't you Professor Kim Hak Bum of Myungsung Foundation?

363
00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:23.740
Do you know me?

364
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.750
I know of your reputation. You are known for your righteousness.

365
00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:30.050
I thought sending you an invitation would only mar your reputation.

366
00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:31.221
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.391
Don't be.

368
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.161
Since it's a happy occasion for Mr. Park,

369
00:22:37.161 --> 00:22:39.330
I think he must have had too many drinks.

370
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.631
It's not that.

371
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:44.231
He's a very sensible man. I'm sure he will politely apologize to you.

372
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.740
Well, you see...

373
00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:52.471
I'd like to give you my sincerest apology if I've offended you.

374
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.481
My gosh, how embarrassing.

375
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.121
You could have asked Sun Young to look after her for a day.

376
00:23:05.121 --> 00:23:06.750
No, I cannot.

377
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:09.191
It doesn't matter when she's sleeping,

378
00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:12.861
but she throws a fit when she can't find me in the morning.

379
00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:14.231
Of course.

380
00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:18.800
Were you close with Ms. Choi Ja Hye?

381
00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:21.701
Yes, I was, but it was a long time ago.

382
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:24.471
She was cool.

383
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.211
I know.

384
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.750
Should I start working again?

385
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.151
No, no.

386
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.951
Everyone has their own place.

387
00:23:38.151 --> 00:23:39.651
And you belong next to me.

388
00:23:40.191 --> 00:23:43.060
It doesn't matter how cool and famous Ms. Choi is.

389
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.330
She can't beat the wife of Taeha Corporation.

390
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.830
Don't get any ideas now.

391
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.500
Isn't that Mi Jung?

392
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.631
Hold on. Stop the car for a second.

393
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.510
Mi Jung, is there something wrong?

394
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.750
Na Ra.

395
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.320
As you can see, I have a lot to carry.

396
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.691
- Let me give you a hand. - No, please don't.

397
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.090
Your arms won't able to lift them. My gosh.

398
00:24:27.131 --> 00:24:29.441
- Yes? - Put your muscles into good use.

399
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:31.211
Why don't you help?

400
00:24:33.641 --> 00:24:34.681
Hurry.

401
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:55.901
Why don't you come inside for a moment?

402
00:24:56.431 --> 00:24:58.231
What... What did you say?

403
00:24:58.231 --> 00:24:59.931
I have something to give to Na Ra.

404
00:25:00.631 --> 00:25:01.901
You can give it to her in person tomorrow.

405
00:25:01.901 --> 00:25:04.471
Hold on. I need to give it to her today.

406
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.240
I need your help. So come inside for a second.

407
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:20.090
Why are you here?

408
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:24.961
I told you I was going to move here.

409
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.760
You... Have you lost your mind?

410
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.971
The problem isn't whether or not I'm in my right mind.

411
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:38.040
I told you to call.

412
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.671
I was staring at my phone all day long.

413
00:25:40.981 --> 00:25:43.580
I couldn't do anything because I was waiting for your call!

414
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.681
I told you not to wait because I had a gathering!

415
00:25:46.881 --> 00:25:50.681
Who are you to tell me not to wait?

416
00:25:52.191 --> 00:25:54.461
If I say I'll wait, I'll wait.

417
00:25:54.461 --> 00:25:57.320
And if I tell you to call, you must call!

418
00:25:58.131 --> 00:26:02.131
You were so into me before. Are you sick of me now? Is that it?

419
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.100
Sorry.

420
00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:08.600
I had no choice.

421
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.211
Don't be like that.

422
00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:19.211
Please?

423
00:27:12.701 --> 00:27:15.600
I'm trying to recruit more attorneys while I expand our office.

424
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.070
I believe this could be a new tune in your life.

425
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.711
Everyone has their own place.

426
00:27:20.711 --> 00:27:22.240
And you belong next to me.

427
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.080
You'll come...

428
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.790
to our usual hotel tomorrow, right?

429
00:28:03.621 --> 00:28:05.790
Go, go, go! Let's drink!

430
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:16.500
What's up?

431
00:28:24.971 --> 00:28:28.310
Hey. My beloved In Ho. Where are you?

432
00:28:30.911 --> 00:28:34.481
We're all hanging out together. Can you come?

433
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.750
I can't go now.

434
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.651
Why not? What are you doing?

435
00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:41.320
It's just getting fun.

436
00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:46.590
Suk and Bum are playing poker right now.

437
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.931
- They're... - Play by yourselves.

438
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.701
They're always the same.

439
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.100
I'll call you later.

440
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:15.020
He should be with Mi Jung.

441
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.891
He's back together with her?

442
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.260
Didn't they break up just before he got married?

443
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.231
They got back together last year.

444
00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:25.300
Mi Jung moved into our town house.

445
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.300
Jackpot. Does In Ho know?

446
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.971
He should by now.

447
00:29:30.971 --> 00:29:32.340
Does Na Ra know too?

448
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.840
You should use your brain once in a while.

449
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.040
Why? This is interesting.

450
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.481
Love affairs are the most interesting love stories.

451
00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:41.550
Am I wrong?

452
00:29:44.691 --> 00:29:46.350
Okay. Two pairs.

453
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.121
Let's see.

454
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.961
- Hey. You come here. - Straight.

455
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:56.000
Are you even human?

456
00:29:57.471 --> 00:29:58.671
Your expression never changes.

457
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.641
Poker face. Haven't you heard of it before?

458
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.641
You.

459
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.141
Go. Now. Go.

460
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:10.911
What's your problem? We aren't objects.

461
00:30:11.211 --> 00:30:13.181
Why are you betting with us? It's annoying...

462
00:30:18.621 --> 00:30:20.221
- What? - I'm sorry.

463
00:30:20.221 --> 00:30:21.760
Seriously.

464
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:24.391
Hey. Get up.

465
00:30:25.461 --> 00:30:26.830
Did you really have to do that?

466
00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:30.830
Hey. Are you okay?

467
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.100
Use this for the medical bill and buy a bag with the rest.

468
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.941
It's okay.

469
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:40.540
Hey. Give me that.

470
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.850
I'll take two out. Okay?

471
00:30:45.651 --> 00:30:47.250
Leave it!

472
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.381
I know about teaching kids.

473
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.020
You'll spoil her.

474
00:30:53.191 --> 00:30:56.121
Losers that have nothing don't need much.

475
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.260
Here.

476
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.661
Let's play again.

477
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.461
Let's continue. Go on.

478
00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:05.030
If you want to continue,

479
00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:08.441
let's play for the 36th Young Sook.

480
00:31:11.611 --> 00:31:15.611
Hey. You know the 36th Young Sook...

481
00:31:16.711 --> 00:31:19.350
is my destiny. We're fated to be together.

482
00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:22.280
Whatever. Don't do it then.

483
00:32:16.371 --> 00:32:18.840
Why is it always this hotel?

484
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.840
Didn't you say you don't like penthouses?

485
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:27.750
When I'm lying in this bed,

486
00:32:28.621 --> 00:32:31.350
I feel like I'm sleeping with four men.

487
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.891
This is the only suite...

488
00:32:36.661 --> 00:32:39.760
that uses the same elevator as the hotel's sky lounge.

489
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.371
You're disgusting.

490
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.770
Leave half an hour later.

491
00:32:50.441 --> 00:32:53.540
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

492
00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:01.621
What?

493
00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.560
Ms. Choi.

494
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:11.391
We're in trouble.

495
00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:16.901
- Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!

496
00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.671
- Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!

497
00:33:23.471 --> 00:33:24.471
Bottoms up!

498
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:35.320
Hello there, our honorable attorney. What brings you here?

499
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.020
Did you hear about Sunnam Apparel?

500
00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.391
Oh, that.

501
00:33:43.621 --> 00:33:44.731
That?

502
00:33:45.361 --> 00:33:48.100
That... That's...

503
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.070
Look, this isn't the right place to discuss that.

504
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.401
Let's discuss work later at the office.

505
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.100
Let me introduce you.

506
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.010
You know Sing Entertainment Agency...

507
00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.111
Sunnam Apparel is a big client for you as well.

508
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.050
It puts our firm in a difficult situation.

509
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.051
Let's talk outside.

510
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:10.481
I'll be right back.

511
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.720
Why are you so clueless?

512
00:34:17.091 --> 00:34:18.890
Can't you see I'm working?

513
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.060
This isn't only about Sunnam Apparel.

514
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:25.901
You know that the clients that you're in charge of...

515
00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.040
are unstable.

516
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.140
Look. I'm not your associate.

517
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.580
I am very offended...

518
00:34:35.441 --> 00:34:38.410
that I need to listen to this garbage...

519
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.981
during my personal time.

520
00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:43.080
Since I've already impinged on your personal life,

521
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.921
why don't I bring up something a little more uncomfortable?

522
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.020
In addition to our fees,

523
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.560
you improperly received a car, a golf club membership,

524
00:34:51.731 --> 00:34:56.031
and even dermatology treatments for your wife.

525
00:34:56.031 --> 00:34:59.071
These were all gifts for...

526
00:34:59.071 --> 00:35:00.270
Then what about this?

527
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.770
How about...

528
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.341
the sexual harassment of an employee at the party?

529
00:35:06.611 --> 00:35:08.381
Don't bother saying you kissed her...

530
00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:11.080
out of affection like a little sister.

531
00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.381
What are you doing?

532
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.020
I'm your partner.

533
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.350
- An equity partner too. - That's why...

534
00:35:19.321 --> 00:35:22.991
I'd like you to pull out your share and your office.

535
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.761
Are you threatening me?

536
00:35:24.761 --> 00:35:28.000
I'm appeasing you to leave voluntarily.

537
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:45.651
(Lawyer, Park Byung Doo)

538
00:35:49.675 --> 00:35:53.175
(Episode 2 will air shortly.)
