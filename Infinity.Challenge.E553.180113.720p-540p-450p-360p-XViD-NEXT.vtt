00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:08.064 line:93%
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:09.965 line:93%
- Infinite Challenge!
- Challenge!

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:13.135 line:93%
Today marks the first day of 2018.
It's the year of dog.

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:16.235 line:93%
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:17.704 line:93%
(They're bowing deeply.)

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:19.134 line:93%
- I knew we were going to do this.
- Happy New Year.

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:20.704 line:93%
(His head hits the floor.)

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:22.574 line:93%
You haven't changed much.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:24.775 line:93%
- Of course you have to bow.
- Of course.

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:26.944 line:93%
Weren't you born
in the year of dog?

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:28.844 line:93%
- Is Sae Ho with us from now on?
- Of course.

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:30.714 line:93%
Yes, I'm joining for this week also.

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:33.085 line:93%
It's the year of dog.
I was born in the year of dog.

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:36.054 line:93%
- He's the big dog.
- Yes, I'm the small dog.

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:37.655 line:93%
Your age difference is 12 years?

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:40.065 line:93%
Myeong Soo was born in 1970,
and Sae Ho was born in 1982.

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.195 line:93%
(He's trying to clarify their ages.)

00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:45.665 line:93%
I'm sorry to interrupt, but
have you changed your glasses?

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:47.565 line:93%
- I have several of them.
- They're cute.

00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:48.934 line:93%
(A sudden compliment)

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:51.205 line:93%
They look great on you.

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:52.705 line:93%
Are we on Infinite Company Special?

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:54.375 line:93%
- What was that?
- You're speaking to Mr. Yu.

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:56.745 line:93%
- He's flattering Jae Seok.
- Yes, he's doing it all of sudden.

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:58.644 line:93%
Why are you flattering Jae Seok
all of sudden?

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:00.915 line:93%
Do you all have any wishes...

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:03.385 line:93%
or resolutions in 2018?

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:05.315 line:93%
Why is your face so cute?

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:07.224 line:93%
- Pardon?
- Your face is so cute.

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:08.355 line:93%
(He doesn't get the situation.)

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:11.355 line:93%
He changed his tactics from being
jealous to being nice.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.564 line:93%
- He's trying to be loved.
- Your face is cute.

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:21.204 line:93%
(The two men got along so well.)

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:26.044 line:93%
(Myeong Soo got so jealous of
their relationship.)

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:28.945 line:93%
(Myeong Soo was desperate to be
loved by Jae Seok.)

00:01:29.044 --> 00:01:30.245 line:93%
My goodness.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:32.115 line:93%
Isn't this year your year,
Myeong Soo?

00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:33.844 line:93%
In 2018,

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:35.514 line:93%
I've started to work out a lot.

00:01:35.514 --> 00:01:37.615 line:93%
- My body feels so much different.
- It feels very different, right?

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:39.624 line:93%
My body shape got better, and
I sleep better.

00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:42.124 line:93%
With cute Jae Seok,

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:45.294 line:93%
- I'd like to make a good program.
- I see. Okay.

00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:48.165 line:93%
- Myeong Soo is trying to...
- Jae Seok is a genius.

00:01:48.395 --> 00:01:50.064 line:93%
He's a cute genius.

00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:52.335 line:93%
They said I'd meet a genius in 2018.
Jae Seok must be the one.

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:54.005 line:93%
- It was you.
- Your juniors...

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:55.464 line:93%
can't even close their mouths.

00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:58.105 line:93%
- They said I'd meet a genius.
- Why?

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.374 line:93%
I learned that I must be like
Myeong Soo to survive.

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:02.404 line:93%
- He's such a good example.
- Stop it.

00:02:02.404 --> 00:02:05.214 line:93%
Flattering someone to survive
ended with Myeong Soo.

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:07.984 line:93%
- I'm just saying that he's cute.
- Don't get me involved, please.

00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:09.184 line:93%
- I did that on purpose.
- I've never seen anyone...

00:02:09.184 --> 00:02:10.255 line:93%
who is cuter than Jae Seok.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.454 line:93%
He means it.

00:02:11.454 --> 00:02:13.755 line:93%
What's your wish for 2018, Haha?

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:15.685 line:93%
For me, I have the same wish
every time.

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:17.794 line:93%
I want to learn something in 2018.

00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:20.565 line:93%
One of our staff said
something to me...

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:23.095 line:93%
- that really hurt my feeling.
- What was it?

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:24.165 line:93%
What was it that hurt your feeling?

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:27.364 line:93%
When we conducted hearing
with Sae Ho last time,

00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:29.475 line:93%
one of the scriptwriters came
to me and said something.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:32.704 line:93%
She said, "We're doing something
new since Sae Ho just joined."

00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:35.875 line:93%
"We're doing some new hearing
session. You don't know the word,"

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.174 line:93%
"do you?"

00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:38.174 line:93%
(You don't know what hearing is,
do you?)

00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:42.984 line:93%
I know what hearing is.
I've seen it from TV since young.

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:45.355 line:93%
She just thought that I wouldn't
know the term.

00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:48.155 line:93%
- She said it like I don't know it.
- I feel much better now.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:49.655 line:93%
I thought she only did that to me.

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:53.195 line:93%
She said the same thing to you.
I thought she only did that to me.

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:56.334 line:93%
- So I was like...
- I didn't know how to take it.

00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:59.204 line:93%
I can pay for your tutors
if you need one.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:00.905 line:93%
I'll think about it.

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:03.905 line:93%
We were in the middle of asking
this. Why are we here today?

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.875 line:93%
You mentioned your new year
resolutions earlier.

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:11.114 line:93%
The most common wish among
people in their 20s and 30s...

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:12.785 line:93%
- is getting employed.
- Of course.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:14.544 line:93%
- Yes, it's true.
- It's tough.

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:16.984 line:93%
Since it's the new year,
we'd want the first topic to be...

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:18.514 line:93%
Don't do stuff like that.

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:20.524 line:93%
I was shocked as we were
talking about this.

00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:22.954 line:93%
- It's tough.
- The exam wasn't long ago.

00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:24.755 line:93%
- What are we doing today?
- Come on, it can't be that.

00:03:24.924 --> 00:03:26.324 line:93%
It hasn't been long since we
took the college exams.

00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:29.294 line:93%
You can't just throw the topics
like that to us.

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.465 line:93%
- Are we taking job interviews?
- No way.

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.364 line:93%
I'm really sorry.

00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:36.005 line:93%
I'm too old for this.

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:38.174 line:93%
My age suits retirement rather.

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:39.875 line:93%
I have to retire, not take
job interviews.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:42.005 line:93%
Am I taking job interviews for
those with experiences?

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:43.215 line:93%
(A faint hope)

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.385 line:93%
- I'd rather get hit.
- Yes, let's meet Pacquiao.

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:47.885 line:93%
It's better if we just get punched.

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:51.084 line:93%
I have actually asked 30 companies
to take your interviews.

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:52.215 line:93%
30 companies?

00:03:52.554 --> 00:03:56.454 line:93%
Three companies have replied us
positively about this.

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:58.894 line:93%
How could you contact
them without telling us?

00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:00.095 line:93%
Which companies?

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:02.935 line:93%
There is this IT company that
develops games.

00:04:03.364 --> 00:04:04.435 line:93%
The company name starts with "N".

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.704 line:93%
That company... It's good for me!

00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:08.405 line:93%
You're talking about
that N company, right?

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:10.334 line:93%
I have so much to say
during the interview then.

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.774 line:93%
- It's a game company.
- I've played a lot of games.

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:15.475 line:93%
- A game company.
- I know those games in depth.

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:17.544 line:93%
This is more advantageous for
Se Hyeong.

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:20.345 line:93%
- It's good for Se Hyeong.
- I can even suggest new ideas.

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:21.614 line:93%
I have so much to talk.

00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:23.285 line:93%
- What about us?
- Take that company then.

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.085 line:93%
I feel like what Se Hyeong is
saying is just like...

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:29.294 line:93%
when we took the College Entrance
Exam. It gave me goosebumps.

00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:30.624 line:93%
(You reminded me of
the College Entrance Exam.)

00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:35.395 line:93%
(Se Hyeong looked like he was the
top student when he solved them.)

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.734 line:93%
(But his answers were all wrong.)

00:04:38.134 --> 00:04:40.734 line:93%
(He only got 7 points.)

00:04:41.335 --> 00:04:42.775 line:93%
(He scored the least.)

00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:44.975 line:93%
- I felt the same thing too.
- Seriously,

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:47.775 line:93%
I felt like this happened before.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.944 line:93%
Okay, it's easy.

00:04:50.044 --> 00:04:52.215 line:93%
He did exactly the same thing
when he solved math problems.

00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:55.085 line:93%
This was the first
confectionery company in Korea.

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:56.114 line:93%
Its name begins with "H".

00:04:57.785 --> 00:04:59.785 line:93%
This snack company is recruiting
for the marketing team.

00:04:59.785 --> 00:05:01.325 line:93%
- Are they hiring marketers?
- It's in the marketing field.

00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:03.155 line:93%
- This works for me well.
- We know marketing.

00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:04.294 line:93%
We actually do marketing.

00:05:04.294 --> 00:05:07.124 line:93%
Myeong Soo has some connections.
He filmed their TV ads before.

00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:09.064 line:93%
Yes, you're right.

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:12.665 line:93%
(Myeong Soo and the H company
worked together 24 years ago.)

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:15.335 line:93%
He worked in the manufacturing
part before too.

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:16.504 line:93%
I've actually worked
in the whiskey factory before.

00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:18.105 line:93%
- Oh, really?
- That's right.

00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.275 line:93%
I remember the colleagues.

00:05:19.275 --> 00:05:20.874 line:93%
There was this man who was
always drunk.

00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:22.845 line:93%
(He always drank whiskey.)

00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:24.645 line:93%
That's how things were back then.

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:27.544 line:93%
And let me tell you
about the third company.

00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:31.355 line:93%
It's a representative start-up
company in Korea. Company B.

00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:33.085 line:93%
(Recruiting people who understand
preferences of younger clientele)

00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:34.984 line:93%
- Some of you...
- My gosh.

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.054 line:93%
- They're quite popular.
- That company is perfect for me.

00:05:37.054 --> 00:05:38.754 line:93%
- Have you delivered food before?
- Really?

00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:40.095 line:93%
- Have you guys done that?
- Okay.

00:05:40.095 --> 00:05:42.325 line:93%
You must understand
the hardships of delivery guys.

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.095 line:93%
I had worked for a long time
as a delivery man.

00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:45.864 line:93%
Well, but I wonder...

00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:47.835 line:93%
- if the companies would hire us.
- Exactly. Why would they hire us?

00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:51.874 line:93%
I had worked at two factories,
but I never worked in an office.

00:05:51.874 --> 00:05:54.004 line:93%
Energy, creativity, proactiveness,
and confidence.

00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:55.605 line:93%
- I have them all.
- Proactiveness?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:56.814 line:93%
- I take initiatives.
- Confidence?

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.415 line:93%
I give my all.

00:05:58.444 --> 00:05:59.645 line:93%
I'm really confident.

00:06:00.085 --> 00:06:01.744 line:93%
(However,
during the real interview,)

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:03.085 line:93%
(he looks quite modest.)

00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:05.884 line:93%
(Where did his confidence go?
His feet are shaking nervously.)

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.525 line:93%
(Will he be able to
ace the interview?)

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:10.095 line:93%
- What about you, Haha?
- I...

00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:12.124 line:93%
- Right.
- I run my own company.

00:06:13.194 --> 00:06:16.134 line:93%
The fact that I must work for other
people is quite demeaning.

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:18.564 line:93%
That's right though.
Haha is the CEO.

00:06:18.564 --> 00:06:21.265 line:93%
He's the very first dummy CEO
in the entertainment business.

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:24.374 line:93%
I guess your business is...

00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:26.075 line:93%
- going well now.
- We made profits this year.

00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:27.544 line:93%
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

00:06:28.105 --> 00:06:29.715 line:93%
- That's not an easy accomplishment.
- How did you manage that?

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:31.444 line:93%
- Sorry?
- How did you make profits?

00:06:31.444 --> 00:06:32.444 line:93%
With the birthday parties.

00:06:32.444 --> 00:06:33.715 line:93%
(That's his area of expertise.)

00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:35.814 line:93%
- I get it now.
- I'll start singing at parties now.

00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:37.814 line:93%
- Haha, but the birthday parties...
- Mark my words. I'll go then.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.725 line:93%
Don't you get a lot of comments
through your social media?

00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:41.955 line:93%
- Don't they invite you?
- Wait, so...

00:06:42.124 --> 00:06:43.855 line:93%
- I did get those comments.
- You did, didn't you?

00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:45.155 line:93%
- I told you.
- The thing is...

00:06:45.294 --> 00:06:46.325 line:93%
- I knew it.
- Right.

00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:48.525 line:93%
- It happened, right?
- So your company...

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:50.134 line:93%
What kind of employees
are you looking for?

00:06:50.134 --> 00:06:52.335 line:93%
My company hired
two more employees this year.

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:54.634 line:93%
- What made you hire them?
- The vibe I got at first made me...

00:06:54.634 --> 00:06:55.835 line:93%
hired them.

00:06:55.835 --> 00:06:57.535 line:93%
(He relies on the "vibe"
to recruit his employees.)

00:06:57.975 --> 00:06:59.804 line:93%
- It's an odd way to hire employees.
- You might laugh at this.

00:06:59.804 --> 00:07:01.275 line:93%
So many of the job-seekers
are desperate.

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:02.374 line:93%
They freeze when they see me.

00:07:02.374 --> 00:07:04.674 line:93%
When I sit in front of them
as the CEO of the company,

00:07:04.944 --> 00:07:06.715 line:93%
- they freeze.
- Everyone is a CEO here.

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:08.285 line:93%
Then I'd say,

00:07:08.944 --> 00:07:10.015 line:93%
"Take your coffee."

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:12.515 line:93%
(He sounds friendly.)

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.855 line:93%
- "Take your coffee."
- Like this?

00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:16.355 line:93%
- Are you scolding them?
- Goodness.

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:18.955 line:93%
- I can't talk to these jokers.
- "Why are you old?" "You're late."

00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:20.895 line:93%
They are in their own world.

00:07:20.895 --> 00:07:23.335 line:93%
- You should say, "Drink coffee".
- I can't work with them.

00:07:23.335 --> 00:07:25.194 line:93%
- You said it wrong.
- When we go in for interviews,

00:07:25.335 --> 00:07:28.134 line:93%
it's not like we will start working
at those companies.

00:07:28.134 --> 00:07:31.105 line:93%
Even so. We hope
that we can be of help...

00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:33.874 line:93%
- to those who are looking for jobs.
- Right.

00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:36.744 line:93%
If we get to show this process
on TV for those people,

00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:38.614 line:93%
- this information would be helpful.
- I agree.

00:07:38.614 --> 00:07:40.184 line:93%
- Okay.
- We should take this seriously.

00:07:40.184 --> 00:07:43.215 line:93%
Actually, when my father used to
work at a company,

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:45.054 line:93%
he worked in HR.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.585 line:93%
I think my father was
in charge of holding interviews.

00:07:48.254 --> 00:07:50.355 line:93%
(Why is he talking
about this all of a sudden?)

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:54.494 line:93%
Can I take this seriously
even if I won't be funny today?

00:07:55.325 --> 00:07:57.494 line:93%
- But you're not that funny anyway.
- I see.

00:07:58.064 --> 00:08:00.105 line:93%
- It's not like you're hilarious.
- I meant to say...

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.504 line:93%
I won't goof around.
I will seriously try to get the job.

00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:04.734 line:93%
Shall we get going then?

00:08:04.874 --> 00:08:05.905 line:93%
Okay.

00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:10.845 line:93%
(Ace the Interview)

00:08:11.544 --> 00:08:14.184 line:93%
(Even if their looks are
all different,)

00:08:14.184 --> 00:08:16.355 line:93%
(everyone has the same goal.)

00:08:17.155 --> 00:08:18.754 line:93%
(We want to get a job!)

00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:22.254 line:93%
(The first round of process is
the resume.)

00:08:22.754 --> 00:08:25.455 line:93%
(Writing the resume is
a task that never ends,)

00:08:25.455 --> 00:08:27.465 line:93%
(but this is a required task
before the interview.)

00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:31.895 line:93%
(Writing the application
for the position)

00:08:32.934 --> 00:08:35.205 line:93%
"Foreign language". "Ability to
use software". Gosh, this...

00:08:35.205 --> 00:08:36.234 line:93%
(Believe it or not,
it's a study group.)

00:08:37.035 --> 00:08:38.234 line:93%
The button, F5, is to copy, right?

00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:41.345 line:93%
(Struggling)

00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:42.345 line:93%
Control.

00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:44.744 line:93%
What do I press
with the shift button?

00:08:46.384 --> 00:08:48.014 line:93%
- Am I wrong?
- Control and c.

00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:49.014 line:93%
(Are you seriously asking me that?)

00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:51.984 line:93%
I have to space
the words correctly too.

00:08:51.984 --> 00:08:53.754 line:93%
- Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province.
- Look at this for me.

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:55.124 line:93%
Perhaps, I should take
a playful approach.

00:08:55.124 --> 00:08:56.654 line:93%
(Unlike the younger members,)

00:08:56.754 --> 00:08:59.624 line:93%
(the older members seem lost.)

00:08:59.624 --> 00:09:02.295 line:93%
(Typing slowly)

00:09:02.295 --> 00:09:03.764 line:93%
Goodness, this is...

00:09:03.764 --> 00:09:06.004 line:93%
(He barely manages to type.)

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:08.634 line:93%
Can you give me a piece of paper?
I can't read this, so I can't type.

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:10.004 line:93%
Myeong Soo, are you serious?

00:09:10.004 --> 00:09:12.374 line:93%
I can read it, but it's hard to read
from the screen.

00:09:12.374 --> 00:09:14.175 line:93%
- Your eyes are really getting bad.
- Guitar.

00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:15.175 line:93%
(What is this?)

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:17.114 line:93%
- What just happened? Where...
- No, no.

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:18.274 line:93%
You can go back.

00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:20.045 line:93%
- But it's not working.
- No, just click this here.

00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:23.114 line:93%
- It worked, didn't it?
- Yes, it did.

00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:26.055 line:93%
If you can't even do this,
how could you apply for a job?

00:09:26.154 --> 00:09:29.524 line:93%
You don't know the basics.
You won't be able to do your job.

00:09:29.894 --> 00:09:31.555 line:93%
I can learn this on the job.

00:09:31.624 --> 00:09:33.225 line:93%
I can ask the senior colleagues
to help.

00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:35.725 line:93%
We can't learn on the job
at companies we are applying for.

00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:38.695 line:93%
We are getting a job there to use
what we learned so far.

00:09:38.695 --> 00:09:39.705 line:93%
You're talking nonsense.

00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:41.965 line:93%
- Can you send an email?
- Do you have to ask?

00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:43.734 line:93%
I pegged you for an employee
who would go from door to door.

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:45.234 line:93%
(He'd visit to get approvals
for projects.)

00:09:45.975 --> 00:09:48.274 line:93%
Hey, you. Please watch your tone.

00:09:48.274 --> 00:09:49.914 line:93%
- Hold on a second.
- Yes?

00:09:49.914 --> 00:09:51.545 line:93%
It seems all of us here
are looking for a job.

00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:55.185 line:93%
- Yes?
- We'll apply for a snack company.

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:56.784 line:93%
How about having some snacks
while working?

00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.254 line:93%
- That's a great idea.
- I like that idea.

00:09:58.284 --> 00:09:59.825 line:93%
- It's natural for us.
- Great.

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:01.455 line:93%
- You'll get the job.
- You bet.

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:03.825 line:93%
- That's such a great idea.
- We must try their products.

00:10:04.394 --> 00:10:05.455 line:93%
(They bring in the snacks.)

00:10:05.455 --> 00:10:06.795 line:93%
Hey, try this.

00:10:06.994 --> 00:10:09.494 line:93%
We should also try
other companies' snacks.

00:10:09.494 --> 00:10:10.994 line:93%
You're right. We must try them
to know how they taste.

00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:13.065 line:93%
(Is the packaging sturdy enough?)

00:10:13.065 --> 00:10:14.734 line:93%
(Is eating two at once possible?)

00:10:14.734 --> 00:10:16.435 line:93%
(Is it big enough for one bite?)

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.835 line:93%
(Among them, especially this guy...)

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:20.545 line:93%
(seems to just eat the snacks.)

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:22.045 line:93%
(This guy with a short neck...)

00:10:22.045 --> 00:10:24.075 line:93%
(pays no attention to others.)

00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:25.644 line:93%
How should I write this?

00:10:25.644 --> 00:10:27.315 line:93%
Buddy, you're eating too much
during the shoot.

00:10:28.484 --> 00:10:31.014 line:93%
Do you think you're playing
games at home now?

00:10:31.014 --> 00:10:33.185 line:93%
- I'm hooked on this.
- What on earth are you doing?

00:10:33.185 --> 00:10:35.754 line:93%
- I'm hooked.
- You're eating all the leftovers.

00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:36.925 line:93%
Leftover Cleaner.

00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:39.124 line:93%
Do I need to write where I grew up
to explain about my childhood?

00:10:39.124 --> 00:10:40.325 line:93%
- Yes.
- The height is 167cm.

00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:41.894 line:93%
"Childhood".

00:10:41.894 --> 00:10:45.634 line:93%
I was born during a hot summer
on August 9 in 1982.

00:10:45.634 --> 00:10:46.634 line:93%
Don't write that.

00:10:46.634 --> 00:10:48.864 line:93%
How is the season of your birth
relevant to this job?

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.734 line:93%
I was going to write
that's why I am very passionate.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.605 line:93%
Write about why your neck is short.

00:10:53.274 --> 00:10:55.545 line:93%
"I can't wear dress shirts
because my neck is short."

00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:56.845 line:93%
My family wasn't rich, but...

00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:58.244 line:93%
Don't write that.
I already wrote that.

00:10:58.244 --> 00:10:59.244 line:93%
"My family wasn't rich, but..."

00:10:59.244 --> 00:11:00.914 line:93%
- Did you write that you were happy?
- I wrote my family wasn't rich.

00:11:00.914 --> 00:11:03.754 line:93%
No one in the 70s was rich.

00:11:03.754 --> 00:11:06.085 line:93%
- That's true. No one was.
- With love...

00:11:06.154 --> 00:11:08.624 line:93%
- I was blessed...
- my parents gave me...

00:11:09.154 --> 00:11:10.894 line:93%
Thanks to my dad
who paved his own path...

00:11:10.994 --> 00:11:11.994 line:93%
Hey!

00:11:12.394 --> 00:11:13.795 line:93%
Don't write about that!

00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:14.795 line:93%
- Why not?
- Gosh.

00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:16.534 line:93%
- Your father is a public official.
- I'm going to use that.

00:11:16.534 --> 00:11:19.465 line:93%
Some parts of our cover letters
are already overlapping.

00:11:19.465 --> 00:11:21.435 line:93%
"Although we weren't rich,
we were a happy family."

00:11:21.435 --> 00:11:24.034 line:93%
I bet the interviewers already read
a lot of similar covers.

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:25.274 line:93%
So those applicants
won't be selected.

00:11:25.274 --> 00:11:26.545 line:93%
- That's what I mean.
- Exactly.

00:11:26.545 --> 00:11:28.144 line:93%
Then how are we supposed write
our cover letters?

00:11:28.144 --> 00:11:30.244 line:93%
How can we write a different one
for each company?

00:11:30.244 --> 00:11:32.045 line:93%
- Why would we write this then?
- We must write a unique letter.

00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:36.754 line:93%
For "mountains and valleys", there's
a space in the middle, right?

00:11:38.254 --> 00:11:39.384 line:93%
(They really should
get a tutor.)

00:11:39.384 --> 00:11:40.384 line:93%
I mean...

00:11:41.585 --> 00:11:43.725 line:93%
"I was born and grew up
in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province."

00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:46.795 line:93%
"I grew up in a house
with a garden in the front yard."

00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:48.465 line:93%
"With games such as
Swinging Torches,"

00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:50.095 line:93%
"Picking up the Bombs,
Eating Grasshoppers,"

00:11:50.095 --> 00:11:51.795 line:93%
"I had a happy childhood."

00:11:52.164 --> 00:11:53.935 line:93%
"Although my family wasn't rich,"

00:11:53.935 --> 00:11:56.004 line:93%
"I grew up in a happy family
with a lot of love from my parents."

00:11:56.004 --> 00:11:57.004 line:93%
That only adds up to 48 characters.

00:11:57.705 --> 00:11:58.935 line:93%
They add up pretty quickly.

00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:01.004 line:93%
It's because the spacing is
included in the limit too.

00:12:01.004 --> 00:12:02.004 line:93%
- Really?
- Yes.

00:12:02.274 --> 00:12:05.744 line:93%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:07.514 line:93%
(Let me tell you about the numbers.)

00:12:07.514 --> 00:12:08.914 line:93%
(They are the language of business.)

00:12:08.914 --> 00:12:09.955 line:93%
He spent 30 dollars.

00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:12.355 line:93%
(I'm the CEO!)

00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:15.325 line:93%
9, 10, 11, 12. Wait.
I think I went over 100 characters.

00:12:15.825 --> 00:12:17.055 line:93%
(Life Principles)

00:12:17.055 --> 00:12:18.095 line:93%
This is great.

00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:20.325 line:93%
"Present Is My Heyday."

00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:21.325 line:93%
(It's mine.)

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.835 line:93%
(Gosh, this is so outdated.)

00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:26.264 line:93%
- That's my motto of my life.
- Are you serious?

00:12:27.004 --> 00:12:29.134 line:93%
- I came up with this.
- That's from "Slam Dunk".

00:12:29.134 --> 00:12:30.504 line:93%
That's right, but...

00:12:30.605 --> 00:12:32.644 line:93%
(He looks like the extra
rather than the main character.)

00:12:32.874 --> 00:12:34.705 line:93%
"When others say, 'Yes',
I'll say, 'Yes, I can.'"

00:12:34.705 --> 00:12:35.845 line:93%
(This is how you ought to do this.)

00:12:36.075 --> 00:12:38.244 line:93%
"I'm always one step ahead. Despite
my old age, my ideas are fresh."

00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:40.884 line:93%
"I take initiatives too quickly,
which can be a weakness."

00:12:40.884 --> 00:12:42.144 line:93%
Isn't this amazing?

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:43.715 line:93%
(Volunteer work must
be done in secret.)

00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:45.514 line:93%
This is beautiful.

00:12:45.654 --> 00:12:48.124 line:93%
Is it "Right hand doesn't know
when the left hand is helping"?

00:12:48.124 --> 00:12:49.154 line:93%
Or vice versa?

00:12:49.154 --> 00:12:50.754 line:93%
- It's the left hand.
- Left hand.

00:12:50.825 --> 00:12:52.825 line:93%
- "Right foot and left hand."
- Gosh, you are unbelievable.

00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:55.325 line:93%
(He's the dumbest.)

00:12:55.624 --> 00:12:57.494 line:93%
I'm going to make sure
you don't get this job.

00:12:57.494 --> 00:12:59.605 line:93%
Goodness, you're frustrating.

00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:01.805 line:93%
- Left hand doesn't...
- What did you write about school?

00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:03.874 line:93%
"I somewhat liked to take the lead."

00:13:03.874 --> 00:13:05.004 line:93%
"Somewhat liked?"

00:13:05.004 --> 00:13:06.975 line:93%
- "Somewhat"? Get rid of that.
- "With my friends..."

00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:08.545 line:93%
I didn't want to say
I always liked to take the lead.

00:13:08.545 --> 00:13:10.274 line:93%
- But you did like taking the lead.
- I always...

00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:11.475 line:93%
got along with my friends.

00:13:11.514 --> 00:13:14.514 line:93%
"I was the funniest guy in school."

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.884 line:93%
I mean it. All of my
friends adored me.

00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:19.014 line:93%
(Every class had someone like him.)

00:13:19.855 --> 00:13:21.725 line:93%
I'm confident with my interview
with the game company.

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:23.195 line:93%
I really like playing games.

00:13:23.355 --> 00:13:24.555 line:93%
But you spend money on games.

00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:25.894 line:93%
(He uses his cash on them.)

00:13:25.894 --> 00:13:29.234 line:93%
When the games had special deals
for Christmas promotions,

00:13:29.234 --> 00:13:31.164 line:93%
he bought them all right away.
I mean, I bought them too.

00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:32.634 line:93%
But it was shocking
that Jae Seok bought them.

00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:34.205 line:93%
You said you won't spend
money on games.

00:13:34.764 --> 00:13:36.534 line:93%
You criticized me
for using my cash on them.

00:13:36.534 --> 00:13:38.534 line:93%
This guy is a walking contradiction.
If you were going to do that...

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:40.504 line:93%
I had to buy the special deal.
It was 23 dollars.

00:13:40.504 --> 00:13:42.105 line:93%
One day, he got all serious.

00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:44.445 line:93%
He asked who Ulsan Baller was.

00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:45.774 line:93%
I told him that it was my agent.

00:13:46.144 --> 00:13:48.014 line:93%
He mentioned my agent didn't give
him an item when he asked.

00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:49.384 line:93%
(He mentioned my agent didn't give
him an item when he asked.)

00:13:49.384 --> 00:13:50.654 line:93%
Hey.

00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:52.114 line:93%
- You.
- You were the funniest.

00:13:52.114 --> 00:13:54.384 line:93%
I guess that must have worked.
He gave me a lot afterwards.

00:13:54.984 --> 00:13:56.055 line:93%
Thank you.

00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:59.195 line:93%
- We're writing the applications.
- Yes?

00:13:59.195 --> 00:14:00.565 line:93%
- It's hard.
- But...

00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:04.095 line:93%
I heard that having the interviews
is just as hard as writing this.

00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:05.234 line:93%
I was told it was like a war.

00:14:05.234 --> 00:14:08.134 line:93%
- I heard it's brutal.
- Two of my cousins are jobseekers.

00:14:08.134 --> 00:14:10.975 line:93%
I called them a while ago
and asked where they were.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.075 line:93%
They said
they went to Gunsan on a trip.

00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:14.874 line:93%
The cousin didn't pass the test
for the position.

00:14:15.374 --> 00:14:18.644 line:93%
I heard that the cousin went
on the trip to get some fresh air.

00:14:18.644 --> 00:14:20.384 line:93%
It must be hard for them.

00:14:20.384 --> 00:14:23.185 line:93%
We will be able to get an interview
after writing the cover letter.

00:14:23.185 --> 00:14:25.185 line:93%
- That's right.
- Some people write this,

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:27.254 line:93%
- but many can't get an interview.
- They may not have an interview.

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:28.254 line:93%
They can't pass...

00:14:28.254 --> 00:14:31.855 line:93%
- the first round.
- That's the most frustrating part.

00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:34.494 line:93%
- They want to work on weaknesses.
- Exactly.

00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:37.965 line:93%
They don't even apply if they don't
have at least five certificates.

00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:40.004 line:93%
We shouldn't approach this
as a job-seeker.

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.364 line:93%
If I were a CEO or the interviewer,

00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:43.374 line:93%
I wouldn't pick myself.

00:14:43.705 --> 00:14:45.034 line:93%
- Me neither.
- I wouldn't choose myself.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.805 line:93%
- I'm not a good candidate.
- I second that.

00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:48.904 line:93%
When we put ourselves
in each other's shoes,

00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:51.244 line:93%
we might be able to
come up with a way.

00:14:51.244 --> 00:14:53.644 line:93%
If you were the CEO of a company,

00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:54.815 line:93%
which member would you choose?

00:14:54.815 --> 00:14:57.355 line:93%
I'm sure Sae Ho will fit
in very well because...

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.654 line:93%
- he's nice to junior colleagues.
- Sae Ho.

00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:02.384 line:93%
- When you go up the ladder,
- So...

00:15:02.384 --> 00:15:03.725 line:93%
You're like a spy
for a competing company.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.965 line:93%
They are usually slim.

00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:06.994 line:93%
- Pardon?
- They are slim.

00:15:06.994 --> 00:15:09.864 line:93%
- They wanted to break the bias.
- Seriously.

00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:13.364 line:93%
(They have to finish the rest
of the cover letter at home.)

00:15:13.364 --> 00:15:17.705 line:93%
After the college entrance exam,
I'm writing a cover letter.

00:15:18.634 --> 00:15:21.404 line:93%
"Questions that are always
asked during interviews".

00:15:22.744 --> 00:15:24.914 line:93%
(It seems like yesterday when we
took the College Entrance Exam.)

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.784 line:93%
I can barely turn on a computer.

00:15:28.614 --> 00:15:30.614 line:93%
This is really hard.

00:15:30.955 --> 00:15:32.085 line:93%
What should I write?

00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:33.825 line:93%
Good morning.

00:15:34.284 --> 00:15:35.855 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:15:35.855 --> 00:15:36.955 line:93%
(Haha's office)

00:15:37.524 --> 00:15:38.595 line:93%
That's right.

00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:40.524 line:93%
Shall we shout our slogan first?

00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:42.664 line:93%
Do we have a slogan?

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.494 line:93%
- A small but strong company!
- A small but strong company!

00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:46.664 line:93%
(Yes, yes, yes)

00:15:48.004 --> 00:15:50.774 line:93%
(The family of a small company
shouts the slogan loudly.)

00:15:50.774 --> 00:15:51.835 line:93%
You know,

00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:53.475 line:93%
for Infinite Challenge,

00:15:54.374 --> 00:15:56.315 line:93%
I need to turn in my resume.

00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:58.815 line:93%
I need to write about
my strengths and weaknesses.

00:16:00.815 --> 00:16:02.144 line:93%
Should I add "Utter fool"?

00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:03.484 line:93%
I only look at one thing.

00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:05.614 line:93%
- Companies like that.
- Really?

00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:08.185 line:93%
It can be read as loyalty and love
for the company.

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:12.254 line:93%
My strength is that...

00:16:12.355 --> 00:16:13.595 line:93%
I am an utter fool.

00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:14.795 line:93%
Should I write that?

00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:16.465 line:93%
"Write down your favorite game."

00:16:16.465 --> 00:16:18.335 line:93%
(Write down your favorite game.)

00:16:18.465 --> 00:16:19.565 line:93%
"Galaga".

00:16:19.965 --> 00:16:21.065 line:93%
"Raccoon".

00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:24.105 line:93%
"Track and Field".
I loved that game.

00:16:24.105 --> 00:16:25.475 line:93%
These games are too old.

00:16:27.774 --> 00:16:29.675 line:93%
This is really hard.

00:16:29.774 --> 00:16:31.144 line:93%
"Introduce yourself with a song."

00:16:31.144 --> 00:16:32.984 line:93%
(Introduce yourself with the focus
on your favorite song.)

00:16:32.984 --> 00:16:35.315 line:93%
A river runs

00:16:35.914 --> 00:16:38.085 line:93%
(It's the latest trend to ask
for a unique self-introduction.)

00:16:39.055 --> 00:16:41.384 line:93%
(I am going to have something
with you)

00:16:42.154 --> 00:16:44.195 line:93%
I will choose "Some".

00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:47.095 line:93%
"Is it my fault that I am bad
at expressing myself?"

00:16:47.565 --> 00:16:49.234 line:93%
"Can't I just say that
I like this company?"

00:16:49.394 --> 00:16:51.134 line:93%
"I want to be honest."

00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:53.504 line:93%
(I am going to have something
with this company)

00:16:53.504 --> 00:16:54.664 line:93%
"I am going to have something
with this company."

00:16:55.164 --> 00:16:56.435 line:93%
That's right.

00:16:58.335 --> 00:16:59.904 line:93%
(Laughing)

00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:02.205 line:93%
I don't know why I keep laughing.

00:17:02.504 --> 00:17:03.874 line:93%
I am laughing more than I did...

00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:05.315 line:93%
during the College Entrance Exam.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:08.345 line:93%
"Describe yourself with one word."

00:17:09.014 --> 00:17:10.914 line:93%
"Describe yourself with one word."

00:17:11.585 --> 00:17:12.785 line:93%
(Thinking)

00:17:13.224 --> 00:17:14.255 line:93%
Bellflower root and pear juice.

00:17:15.124 --> 00:17:16.424 line:93%
It's tasty and healthy.

00:17:17.154 --> 00:17:19.194 line:93%
It will stay fresh for a long time
in the refrigerator.

00:17:19.864 --> 00:17:21.795 line:93%
"With the worsening
unemployment rate came..."

00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:23.634 line:93%
"the pressuring interview."

00:17:24.295 --> 00:17:27.364 line:93%
"Popular questions
in a pressuring interview."

00:17:27.364 --> 00:17:28.634 line:93%
"Unexpected questions."

00:17:29.204 --> 00:17:31.474 line:93%
"You can't hold your liquor,
but get asked to drink for the job."

00:17:31.474 --> 00:17:33.105 line:93%
(What would you do?)

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:34.374 line:93%
"What would you do?"

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:37.275 line:93%
"Pick three friends you would invite
to a company party."

00:17:37.745 --> 00:17:38.914 line:93%
Is that an interview question?

00:17:38.914 --> 00:17:40.644 line:93%
"Why should we hire you?"

00:17:42.345 --> 00:17:43.985 line:93%
(Under pressure)

00:17:45.184 --> 00:17:46.855 line:93%
Send in the next applicant.

00:17:47.924 --> 00:17:48.985 line:93%
Welcome.

00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:51.224 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:53.825 line:93%
- The weather is cold.
- Yes.

00:17:53.825 --> 00:17:55.525 line:93%
Wasn't it hard to come this far?

00:17:56.095 --> 00:17:57.565 line:93%
(Cho Kyu Sung, Sae Ho's father)

00:17:58.434 --> 00:18:00.634 line:93%
(Sae Ho's father?)

00:18:01.105 --> 00:18:03.305 line:93%
(Sae Ho's father is
a capoeira master.)

00:18:03.305 --> 00:18:04.305 line:93%
- Really?
- For real?

00:18:04.305 --> 00:18:05.374 line:93%
I am serious.

00:18:05.374 --> 00:18:06.474 line:93%
My father is?

00:18:06.474 --> 00:18:08.305 line:93%
(He was said to be the master
of capoeira and Brazilian waxing.)

00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:10.974 line:93%
(He will use his experiences
as an HR manager to help his son.)

00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:13.345 line:93%
- The weather is cold.
- Yes.

00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:15.114 line:93%
Wasn't it hard to come this far?

00:18:15.245 --> 00:18:17.315 line:93%
No, it wasn't hard.

00:18:17.454 --> 00:18:19.585 line:93%
This is the company I will...

00:18:20.924 --> 00:18:22.694 line:93%
Let me try again.

00:18:22.694 --> 00:18:24.124 line:93%
It's nerve-wracking.

00:18:24.295 --> 00:18:26.065 line:93%
My name is Cho Sae Ho.
It's nice to meet you.

00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:27.894 line:93%
- Please sit down.
- Excuse me.

00:18:29.364 --> 00:18:30.595 line:93%
Don't say, "Excuse me."

00:18:30.595 --> 00:18:32.464 line:93%
Okay. I shouldn't.

00:18:32.464 --> 00:18:33.805 line:93%
Welcome.

00:18:34.134 --> 00:18:36.605 line:93%
(It looks like he will only practice
entering the room.)

00:18:36.904 --> 00:18:38.075 line:93%
Hello.

00:18:38.174 --> 00:18:40.805 line:93%
Why did you apply to this company?

00:18:41.305 --> 00:18:42.575 line:93%
Ever since I was young...

00:18:45.114 --> 00:18:47.144 line:93%
Which company is this?

00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:50.085 line:93%
Let's say
it's a confectionery company.

00:18:50.085 --> 00:18:51.285 line:93%
A confectionery company.

00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:52.724 line:93%
Let's try it again.

00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:55.755 line:93%
Come in.

00:18:55.755 --> 00:18:57.295 line:93%
(We didn't copy and paste
the footage.)

00:18:57.295 --> 00:18:58.454 line:93%
Hello.

00:18:59.095 --> 00:19:01.364 line:93%
Ever since I was young,

00:19:01.525 --> 00:19:02.835 line:93%
I wanted to...

00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:04.535 line:93%
(Clearing his throat)

00:19:04.535 --> 00:19:06.805 line:93%
I can be a familiar face...

00:19:06.805 --> 00:19:07.864 line:93%
(The vending machine
of answers struggles.)

00:19:07.864 --> 00:19:08.864 line:93%
I am sorry.

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.305 line:93%
However, this company is...

00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:12.204 line:93%
the most...

00:19:12.204 --> 00:19:13.704 line:93%
In my opinion...

00:19:13.704 --> 00:19:14.805 line:93%
My weakness...

00:19:15.474 --> 00:19:17.114 line:93%
is lack of concentration.

00:19:17.474 --> 00:19:18.845 line:93%
However, it's nothing...

00:19:19.114 --> 00:19:20.884 line:93%
you need to worry about.

00:19:21.444 --> 00:19:23.384 line:93%
What makes you think
I don't need to worry about it?

00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:25.085 line:93%
Once you give me a task,

00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:27.985 line:93%
I will be able to prove myself.

00:19:30.025 --> 00:19:32.694 line:93%
Before a job interview,

00:19:32.694 --> 00:19:35.265 line:93%
there are things
you need to prepare.

00:19:35.325 --> 00:19:36.495 line:93%
(He has many things
to study and prepare.)

00:19:36.495 --> 00:19:38.194 line:93%
Read up on this material.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.065 line:93%
Before you sat down,
you said, "Excuse me."

00:19:41.204 --> 00:19:42.835 line:93%
You don't need to be excused.

00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:45.174 line:93%
When they call for you,

00:19:45.174 --> 00:19:46.904 line:93%
they'll tell you to sit down.
You just need to say, "Thank you".

00:19:46.974 --> 00:19:48.674 line:93%
You can also say,

00:19:49.005 --> 00:19:52.114 line:93%
- "Thank you for this opportunity."
- "Thank you."

00:19:52.245 --> 00:19:53.914 line:93%
You can say that instead.

00:19:54.045 --> 00:19:59.154 line:93%
Make the interviewer think,
"I need to hire this person."

00:19:59.424 --> 00:20:02.224 line:93%
You need to get your points across.

00:20:02.224 --> 00:20:03.755 line:93%
I failed to do that, right?

00:20:03.755 --> 00:20:05.194 line:93%
I did get your points,

00:20:05.194 --> 00:20:07.664 line:93%
but you stuttered.

00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:09.565 line:93%
(He stuttered as he gave him a tip.)

00:20:09.694 --> 00:20:10.835 line:93%
Let's go.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.035 line:93%
- Good luck.
- Okay.

00:20:12.664 --> 00:20:14.305 line:93%
In my current state,
I am very likely to fail,

00:20:14.305 --> 00:20:15.605 line:93%
- right?
- In your current state,

00:20:16.335 --> 00:20:18.305 line:93%
the chance is over 90 percent.

00:20:18.474 --> 00:20:19.545 line:93%
The chance of success?

00:20:19.545 --> 00:20:20.805 line:93%
- No, the chance of failure.
- I see.

00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:22.714 line:93%
(The chance of failure
is over 90 percent.)

00:20:22.874 --> 00:20:25.214 line:93%
You need to tell the company...

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.545 line:93%
that they need you.

00:20:27.214 --> 00:20:29.015 line:93%
(They finished writing
their resumes.)

00:20:29.585 --> 00:20:31.914 line:93%
(Jae Seok's resume
and Se Hyeong's resume)

00:20:32.825 --> 00:20:33.924 line:93%
(Myeong Soo's resume)

00:20:33.924 --> 00:20:35.525 line:93%
(His tastes in games show
his old age.)

00:20:36.124 --> 00:20:37.555 line:93%
(Haha's resume)

00:20:37.555 --> 00:20:39.525 line:93%
(He didn't include "Utter fool"
in the end.)

00:20:40.525 --> 00:20:41.565 line:93%
(Sae Ho's resume)

00:20:41.565 --> 00:20:43.335 line:93%
(The vending machine of answers
has many things to say.)

00:20:43.335 --> 00:20:44.464 line:93%
(Jun Ha's resume)

00:20:44.464 --> 00:20:45.864 line:93%
(He wrote that he studied
for 4 years to go to a university.)

00:20:46.364 --> 00:20:47.535 line:93%
(They applied to 3 companies.)

00:20:48.134 --> 00:20:50.775 line:93%
(Only the job interview remains.)

00:20:51.704 --> 00:20:53.045 line:93%
(You have a message.)

00:20:53.144 --> 00:20:54.745 line:93%
(Information on the final interview
for the new recruits)

00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:56.614 line:93%
(Hello, this is the HR manager.
Please attend the interview.)

00:20:58.575 --> 00:21:01.315 line:93%
(Ace the Interview)

00:21:02.214 --> 00:21:06.555 line:93%
(It's the day of the interview.)

00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:10.194 line:93%
(People are busy going to work
in the morning.)

00:21:11.154 --> 00:21:14.025 line:93%
(The job seeker walks
with a heavy heart.)

00:21:14.795 --> 00:21:18.295 line:93%
(I wish I had a company to go to.)

00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:20.364 line:93%
(They are both nervous...)

00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:22.105 line:93%
I am so nervous.

00:21:22.105 --> 00:21:24.275 line:93%
(and excited.)

00:21:24.275 --> 00:21:27.005 line:93%
A, E, I, O, U.

00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:29.174 line:93%
(Today is the day of the interview.)

00:21:29.174 --> 00:21:30.815 line:93%
This is driving me crazy.

00:21:31.045 --> 00:21:32.075 line:93%
(They go to N game company first.)

00:21:32.075 --> 00:21:33.485 line:93%
This is driving me crazy.

00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:35.785 line:93%
This is driving me crazy.

00:21:36.355 --> 00:21:40.055 line:93%
(Will they be able to do well?)

00:21:41.654 --> 00:21:44.194 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:21:45.224 --> 00:21:46.495 line:93%
This can't be the right room.

00:21:46.495 --> 00:21:47.495 line:93%
(Hesitant)

00:21:48.095 --> 00:21:50.035 line:93%
- Did the interview begin?
- Pardon?

00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:52.535 line:93%
He must be the department head.

00:21:52.904 --> 00:21:54.505 line:93%
- My goodness.
- You just got here.

00:21:54.505 --> 00:21:55.704 line:93%
I guess the interview
will take place in this room.

00:21:55.704 --> 00:21:57.174 line:93%
Don't aggravate him.

00:21:57.404 --> 00:21:59.474 line:93%
Will there be
a lot of unexpected questions?

00:21:59.474 --> 00:22:01.045 line:93%
I learned...

00:22:01.045 --> 00:22:03.045 line:93%
pressuring questions
are popular these days.

00:22:03.315 --> 00:22:04.575 line:93%
Pressuring questions.

00:22:04.575 --> 00:22:05.845 line:93%
- What's that?
- For example,

00:22:05.845 --> 00:22:07.914 line:93%
the interviewer sees
how you react...

00:22:07.914 --> 00:22:10.285 line:93%
to a question that frustrates you.

00:22:10.654 --> 00:22:11.755 line:93%
It's right here.

00:22:12.055 --> 00:22:14.025 line:93%
Oh, these questions are available.

00:22:14.025 --> 00:22:15.624 line:93%
These are actual questions
from an interview.

00:22:15.624 --> 00:22:18.154 line:93%
- Why should we hire you?
- That's right.

00:22:19.025 --> 00:22:20.825 line:93%
That's a great question.

00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:23.364 line:93%
It has been a while
since I received that question.

00:22:23.364 --> 00:22:26.235 line:93%
Hold on. You shouldn't judge
the interviewer.

00:22:26.265 --> 00:22:27.704 line:93%
Why should we hire you?

00:22:27.964 --> 00:22:29.605 line:93%
If you don't hire me,
I will go somewhere else...

00:22:29.605 --> 00:22:30.934 line:93%
and ruin this company.

00:22:32.704 --> 00:22:33.974 line:93%
You wrote that you want to receive
30,000 dollars a year.

00:22:33.974 --> 00:22:35.745 line:93%
We can't give you that much.
What will be your decision?

00:22:35.775 --> 00:22:37.045 line:93%
You will give me that money.

00:22:37.414 --> 00:22:38.545 line:93%
(Nodding)

00:22:38.674 --> 00:22:40.045 line:93%
Are you in a fight?

00:22:40.114 --> 00:22:41.845 line:93%
Will something bad happen otherwise?

00:22:41.845 --> 00:22:43.555 line:93%
That's how confident I am.

00:22:44.414 --> 00:22:46.384 line:93%
Please talk about
the best and worst decisions...

00:22:46.384 --> 00:22:47.424 line:93%
of your life.

00:22:47.585 --> 00:22:49.595 line:93%

Today, I will guide you
through the interview process.

00:23:04.805 --> 00:23:06.204 line:93%
I am Cha Yu Sun
of the HR department.

00:23:06.374 --> 00:23:08.204 line:93%
(He claps to gain her favor.)

00:23:08.904 --> 00:23:10.745 line:93%
Today, there will be...

00:23:10.745 --> 00:23:12.585 line:93%
1st and 2nd interviews.

00:23:12.585 --> 00:23:14.085 line:93%

Good luck.

00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:24.795 line:93%
- I feel like a fool.
- Please come this way.

00:23:25.124 --> 00:23:26.164 line:93%
(Spraying)

00:23:27.164 --> 00:23:28.164 line:93%
We will be back.

00:23:28.164 --> 00:23:29.495 line:93%

00:23:30.664 --> 00:23:31.964 line:93%
No matter who gets the job,

00:23:31.964 --> 00:23:33.565 line:93%
- let's stay in touch.
- Let's offer congratulations.

00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:34.904 line:93%

00:23:34.904 --> 00:23:36.305 line:93%
(He gets ready belatedly.)

00:23:37.204 --> 00:23:38.605 line:93%
She is telling us to hurry.

00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:43.374 line:93%
(Hurried)

00:23:43.374 --> 00:23:44.614 line:93%
(Turning)

00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:47.644 line:93%
(He is already having
a mental breakdown.)

00:23:49.085 --> 00:23:52.315 line:93%
(People who await them...)

00:23:53.055 --> 00:23:55.724 line:93%
(have sharp eyes...)

00:23:55.724 --> 00:23:58.255 line:93%
(and poker faces.)

00:23:58.825 --> 00:24:02.864 line:93%
(What is the interview
for game developers like?)

00:24:04.835 --> 00:24:06.364 line:93%
(They finally enter.)

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:09.204 line:93%
(They tiptoe into the room.)

00:24:09.204 --> 00:24:10.374 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:24:10.374 --> 00:24:11.735 line:93%
(Jae Seok and Myeong Soo
politely say hello.)

00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:14.305 line:93%
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

00:24:15.045 --> 00:24:16.644 line:93%
(Even the interviewers bow.)

00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:19.144 line:93%
(Sae Ho enters with confidence.)

00:24:20.045 --> 00:24:22.315 line:93%
Thank you for this opportunity.

00:24:23.255 --> 00:24:24.954 line:93%
(He learned well from his father.)

00:24:24.954 --> 00:24:26.025 line:93%
Okay.

00:24:26.025 --> 00:24:27.224 line:93%
(Once they sit down,)

00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:31.355 line:93%
(they become nervous and anxious.)

00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:34.224 line:93%
(Park Woong Suk, Baek Han Ju,
Lee Eun Suk)

00:24:34.664 --> 00:24:37.664 line:93%
Now, you will have...

00:24:37.864 --> 00:24:40.464 line:93%
the first interview.

00:24:40.464 --> 00:24:41.605 line:93%
In the first interview,

00:24:41.765 --> 00:24:44.305 line:93%
we will ask you some questions
that have no right answers.

00:24:44.305 --> 00:24:47.374 line:93%
Please feel free to share
your thoughts and values...

00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:51.845 line:93%
as there is no right answer.

00:24:51.874 --> 00:24:53.384 line:93%
We will give you 60 seconds.

00:24:53.384 --> 00:24:57.454 line:93%
Tell us about yourself
in the best way you can.

00:24:58.184 --> 00:24:59.355 line:93%
- Applicant.
- Yes.

00:24:59.454 --> 00:25:00.884 line:93%
(The overenthusiastic applicant
goes first.)

00:25:01.154 --> 00:25:03.124 line:93%
Now, I will introduce myself.

00:25:03.124 --> 00:25:05.154 line:93%
- There is no right form.
- Okay.

00:25:05.154 --> 00:25:07.124 line:93%
I have a nickname.

00:25:07.325 --> 00:25:09.495 line:93%
Many people call me...

00:25:09.495 --> 00:25:10.835 line:93%
a professional traveler.

00:25:10.894 --> 00:25:11.964 line:93%
I was given the nickname...

00:25:11.964 --> 00:25:16.105 line:93%
because I am willing
to run diligently to the destiny...

00:25:16.105 --> 00:25:17.575 line:93%
no matter where I am asked to go.

00:25:17.674 --> 00:25:19.245 line:93%
Before I applied for this company,

00:25:20.105 --> 00:25:21.474 line:93%
I worked as a comedian.

00:25:21.474 --> 00:25:24.315 line:93%
When I approach people,

00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:25.644 line:93%
I have...

00:25:26.214 --> 00:25:28.114 line:93%
(His mind goes blank.)

00:25:30.085 --> 00:25:31.355 line:93%
(Laughing)

00:25:31.654 --> 00:25:33.085 line:93%
(I must not laugh.)

00:25:33.454 --> 00:25:35.184 line:93%
Right...

00:25:35.755 --> 00:25:37.624 line:93%
- May I ask a question?
- Yes.

00:25:37.624 --> 00:25:39.224 line:93%
You introduced yourself...

00:25:39.464 --> 00:25:42.124 line:93%
- as a traveler.
- Yes.

00:25:42.164 --> 00:25:44.765 line:93%
Does it mean that you will take...

00:25:44.765 --> 00:25:47.204 line:93%
an offer from another company?

00:25:47.204 --> 00:25:50.535 line:93%
It's possible,
but I'm looking for a company...

00:25:50.735 --> 00:25:52.474 line:93%
to settle down.

00:25:52.974 --> 00:25:56.174 line:93%
Even though I was a traveler...

00:25:56.515 --> 00:25:57.575 line:93%
(He forgets what to say.)

00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.614 line:93%
(He bursts out laughing.)

00:25:59.614 --> 00:26:01.614 line:93%
I went through a hard time.

00:26:01.815 --> 00:26:03.785 line:93%
I moved from one show to another.

00:26:05.714 --> 00:26:09.295 line:93%
I'd like to settle down now.

00:26:09.295 --> 00:26:11.595 line:93%
(Listening skills are
also evaluated.)

00:26:11.694 --> 00:26:14.964 line:93%
- Why do you laugh?
- I'm sorry, sir.

00:26:15.595 --> 00:26:17.295 line:93%
Whoever is ready,
introduce yourself.

00:26:17.495 --> 00:26:19.765 line:93%
- Go ahead.
- May I go first? Okay.

00:26:20.864 --> 00:26:21.964 line:93%
Hello.

00:26:22.775 --> 00:26:26.874 line:93%
I can do it. I can do it.

00:26:27.245 --> 00:26:28.704 line:93%
(Surprised)

00:26:28.904 --> 00:26:32.985 line:93%
I complete any task with much
responsibility once it's given.

00:26:33.144 --> 00:26:35.184 line:93%
I'm Yu Jae Seok
who's capable of anything.

00:26:35.684 --> 00:26:37.384 line:93%
(That's my phrase.)

00:26:37.384 --> 00:26:38.414 line:93%
Thank you.

00:26:38.414 --> 00:26:39.954 line:93%
(He's laughing again.)

00:26:41.724 --> 00:26:43.995 line:93%
You may stay seated.

00:26:43.995 --> 00:26:45.894 line:93%
- Yes.
- I was adjusting my seat.

00:26:46.694 --> 00:26:50.565 line:93%
I believe the most important skill
is listening.

00:26:50.795 --> 00:26:52.464 line:93%
If you don't listen,

00:26:52.464 --> 00:26:55.565 line:93%
it's difficult to
empathize with others.

00:26:55.565 --> 00:26:58.275 line:93%
In order to make a perfect game,

00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:02.105 line:93%
investing in sounds
is quite important.

00:27:02.105 --> 00:27:03.914 line:93%
I'd like to...

00:27:04.374 --> 00:27:05.914 line:93%
focus on that.

00:27:05.914 --> 00:27:09.315 line:93%
What you said is more related to
game sound engineer.

00:27:09.855 --> 00:27:12.654 line:93%
Working as a game designer
is different.

00:27:13.124 --> 00:27:15.184 line:93%
Didn't you apply to
planning department?

00:27:16.055 --> 00:27:17.295 line:93%
Is that so?

00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:20.224 line:93%
- Anyway...
- You could be helpful.

00:27:20.224 --> 00:27:22.964 line:93%
This is very important.

00:27:23.295 --> 00:27:25.934 line:93%
Contrary to what we believe,
sight isn't the most important.

00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:29.374 line:93%
Hearing is most important
for human satisfaction.

00:27:29.674 --> 00:27:32.075 line:93%
I completely agree with
what you're saying.

00:27:32.075 --> 00:27:34.575 line:93%
- Hearing is very important.
- However, you applied to...

00:27:34.575 --> 00:27:37.674 line:93%
- game planning department.
- It also applies.

00:27:37.674 --> 00:27:40.614 line:93%
Sound is also important in planning.

00:27:40.614 --> 00:27:42.684 line:93%
Which direction do we take
in sounds?

00:27:42.855 --> 00:27:44.755 line:93%
This is very important.

00:27:44.755 --> 00:27:46.924 line:93%
- We'll take it into consideration.
- Okay.

00:27:48.255 --> 00:27:50.724 line:93%
In your application, you wrote...

00:27:50.724 --> 00:27:53.164 line:93%
"There are many cups and lips."

00:27:53.325 --> 00:27:55.934 line:93%
"Chinese market is the only answer.
There are many cups and lips."

00:27:56.864 --> 00:27:59.065 line:93%
Did you mean "There's many
a slip twixt cup and lip"?

00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:01.235 line:93%
Did you mean something else?

00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:04.474 line:93%
- It's a typo.
- I see.

00:28:05.005 --> 00:28:07.404 line:93%
I'm not sure what I meant.

00:28:07.474 --> 00:28:08.904 line:93%
- You don't remember?
- No.

00:28:09.144 --> 00:28:11.614 line:93%
- Did you write the application?
- Yes, that's right.

00:28:12.315 --> 00:28:14.944 line:93%
He seems unpredictable.

00:28:15.384 --> 00:28:17.585 line:93%
At the company,

00:28:17.585 --> 00:28:20.055 line:93%
teamwork is quite important.

00:28:20.384 --> 00:28:22.454 line:93%
In that regard,

00:28:22.555 --> 00:28:24.924 line:93%
I couldn't give him a high score.

00:28:25.654 --> 00:28:28.694 line:93%
We'll ask questions
individually now.

00:28:28.825 --> 00:28:32.765 line:93%
Was there a time when
you lost your sense of pride?

00:28:32.835 --> 00:28:37.035 line:93%
How did you come up
with your email address?

00:28:37.035 --> 00:28:39.974 line:93%
If you could go back,
which time of your life would it be?

00:28:39.974 --> 00:28:44.075 line:93%
Please explain the rules of
What's the Time, Mr. Wolf?

00:28:45.174 --> 00:28:49.985 line:93%
(The interviewers' questions
make their minds go blank.)

00:28:50.614 --> 00:28:53.954 line:93%
This is it for the first interview.

00:28:54.224 --> 00:28:56.595 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

00:28:57.525 --> 00:28:58.654 line:93%
Thank you.

00:28:59.765 --> 00:29:01.364 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:02.765 line:93%
(They bow one more time.)

00:29:02.765 --> 00:29:05.434 line:93%
- Thank you. Please return...
- Thank you.

00:29:05.434 --> 00:29:07.235 line:93%
- to the waiting room.
- That was really difficult.

00:29:09.235 --> 00:29:10.335 line:93%
What did you think?

00:29:12.134 --> 00:29:13.575 line:93%
(He's unsure.)

00:29:13.575 --> 00:29:14.605 line:93%
It was...

00:29:15.374 --> 00:29:16.775 line:93%
What did you think?

00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:18.914 line:93%
They understand the basic...

00:29:18.914 --> 00:29:20.815 line:93%
of entertainment industry.

00:29:20.845 --> 00:29:22.914 line:93%
They have a strong base,

00:29:23.285 --> 00:29:25.384 line:93%
so they seem qualified.

00:29:25.384 --> 00:29:27.884 line:93%
I wonder if their background fits...

00:29:28.085 --> 00:29:29.755 line:93%
our standards.

00:29:29.995 --> 00:29:32.495 line:93%
During the second interview,

00:29:32.825 --> 00:29:36.235 line:93%
we should evaluate Myeong Soo
regarding teamwork.

00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:37.495 line:93%
Okay, sir.

00:29:37.894 --> 00:29:39.505 line:93%
(Coming up next)

00:29:40.005 --> 00:29:42.904 line:93%
The second interview
will be a discussion.

00:29:43.605 --> 00:29:47.075 line:93%
Since it's Winter Olympics,
playing in an ice rink is the best.

00:29:47.374 --> 00:29:49.144 line:93%
Why in an ice rink?

00:29:49.144 --> 00:29:50.444 line:93%
This is Winter Olympics.

00:29:50.444 --> 00:29:53.045 line:93%
Snow and ice are necessary
during Winter Olympics.

00:29:53.085 --> 00:29:55.345 line:93%
I'm sorry, but I can't work
with you at this rate.

00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:57.555 line:93%
This is missing the point.

00:29:57.555 --> 00:30:00.325 line:93%
Kicking jaegi on ice
without falling...

00:30:00.384 --> 00:30:02.424 line:93%
is what makes people applaud.

00:30:02.454 --> 00:30:05.924 line:93%
As we're a game production company,

00:30:05.964 --> 00:30:08.525 line:93%
people usually expect
individualism...

00:30:08.525 --> 00:30:11.265 line:93%
and autonomy to be most important.

00:30:11.265 --> 00:30:15.235 line:93%
However, teamwork is essential
in the process of making games.

00:30:15.704 --> 00:30:18.934 line:93%
If candidates show a balance of
individual expression...

00:30:19.174 --> 00:30:21.474 line:93%
and teamwork skills,

00:30:21.605 --> 00:30:24.845 line:93%
they'll be considered
highly qualified.

00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:27.714 line:93%
I'm very nervous.

00:30:29.114 --> 00:30:30.914 line:93%
- Goodness.
- They're back.

00:30:31.815 --> 00:30:34.355 line:93%
- How did it go?
- It was a mess.

00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.194 line:93%
- What did they ask?
- What kind of questions?

00:30:36.194 --> 00:30:38.255 line:93%
- The rest of you,
- They were normal questions.

00:30:38.325 --> 00:30:40.394 line:93%
please wait for your next interview.

00:30:40.624 --> 00:30:42.224 line:93%
Myeong Soo.

00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:45.134 line:93%
You didn't answer their
questions correctly.

00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:47.664 line:93%
- Seriously.
- They asked to introduce ourselves.

00:30:47.704 --> 00:30:49.735 line:93%
- Did he say something else?
- When he introduced himself,
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

00:30:49.735 --> 00:30:52.545 line:93%
- he talked about hearing.
- Hearing?

00:30:52.545 --> 00:30:54.944 line:93%
He talked about
the importance of sounds.

00:30:55.005 --> 00:30:57.914 line:93%
Why did you bring up
being a traveler?

00:30:57.914 --> 00:31:00.245 line:93%
- Did he say that?
- He talked about being a traveler.

00:31:00.245 --> 00:31:04.055 line:93%
I read that it's good to include
your nickname in introduction.

00:31:04.085 --> 00:31:05.085 line:93%
No one laughed.

00:31:05.714 --> 00:31:06.785 line:93%
(The first group is relieved
after the interview.)

00:31:06.785 --> 00:31:09.124 line:93%
- I'm nervous. What should I do?
- Me too.

00:31:09.124 --> 00:31:10.295 line:93%
It's nerve-racking.

00:31:10.525 --> 00:31:11.795 line:93%
I'm very nervous.

00:31:11.825 --> 00:31:14.364 line:93%
- My goodness.
- She's here.

00:31:14.364 --> 00:31:15.595 line:93%
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

00:31:15.595 --> 00:31:17.394 line:93%
- It's our turn.
- Your interview is next.

00:31:17.394 --> 00:31:18.434 line:93%
- Good luck.
- We'll get going.

00:31:18.434 --> 00:31:20.204 line:93%
Mr. Jung Jun Ha
and Yang Se Hyeong.

00:31:20.434 --> 00:31:22.305 line:93%
- Mr. Haha.
- Okay.

00:31:22.305 --> 00:31:23.805 line:93%
(Nervous)

00:31:23.934 --> 00:31:26.144 line:93%
Gosh, we're in trouble.

00:31:26.144 --> 00:31:27.944 line:93%
What should we do?

00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:30.545 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:31:30.545 --> 00:31:33.345 line:93%
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello, sir.

00:31:33.485 --> 00:31:34.644 line:93%
Nice to meet you.

00:31:34.985 --> 00:31:36.855 line:93%
- Please have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

00:31:38.285 --> 00:31:40.025 line:93%
(He smiles back at Jun Ha.)

00:31:40.025 --> 00:31:42.454 line:93%
I'm sure you're prepared.

00:31:42.454 --> 00:31:45.055 line:93%
During 60 seconds,
please introduce yourself...

00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:47.164 line:93%
in an appealing way.

00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:49.795 line:93%
- Whoever is ready should start.
- Do we introduce ourselves?

00:31:50.295 --> 00:31:52.394 line:93%
Yang Se Hyeong is where joy is.

00:31:52.394 --> 00:31:54.164 line:93%
Yang Se Hyeong is
where happiness is.

00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:57.204 line:93%
I'm Yang Se Hyeong,
and I make people happy.

00:31:57.204 --> 00:31:58.474 line:93%
It's nice to meet you.

00:31:58.904 --> 00:32:01.174 line:93%
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:04.345 line:93%
I used to be obsessed
with a car racing game,

00:32:04.845 --> 00:32:08.184 line:93%
so I practically lived
at an internet cafe.

00:32:08.245 --> 00:32:10.154 line:93%
When I reached the top level,

00:32:10.454 --> 00:32:14.025 line:93%
I was proud of myself. I understood
why people play games.

00:32:14.124 --> 00:32:15.285 line:93%
Coincidentally,

00:32:15.755 --> 00:32:18.525 line:93%
the game was made by this company.

00:32:18.855 --> 00:32:20.694 line:93%
I hope you'll consider me.

00:32:20.694 --> 00:32:23.164 line:93%
I hope it'll be a great interview.

00:32:23.235 --> 00:32:25.495 line:93%
I'm Haha. Thank you.

00:32:26.335 --> 00:32:27.704 line:93%
Hello.

00:32:29.164 --> 00:32:31.904 line:93%
I'd like to make
a strict working environment...

00:32:31.934 --> 00:32:34.605 line:93%
to be fun and enjoyable.

00:32:34.605 --> 00:32:38.714 line:93%
I'm Jung Jun Ha.
It's nice to meet you.

00:32:39.585 --> 00:32:42.684 line:93%
I've lost a lot of interest
in games.

00:32:42.755 --> 00:32:44.684 line:93%
I've lost a lot of interest
in games.

00:32:45.384 --> 00:32:47.384 line:93%
(His honesty comes out
unexpectedly.)

00:32:48.555 --> 00:32:51.424 line:93%
(He expresses his lack of interest
in games to a game company.)

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:55.995 line:93%
I thought it would be great
if there were games...

00:32:56.164 --> 00:32:58.765 line:93%
enjoyable for people in their 40s.

00:32:59.134 --> 00:33:00.765 line:93%
That's why I'm here.

00:33:01.664 --> 00:33:02.835 line:93%
It's nice to meet you.

00:33:03.505 --> 00:33:05.204 line:93%
Thank you.

00:33:06.644 --> 00:33:08.904 line:93%
(Meanwhile, in the waiting room...)

00:33:10.174 --> 00:33:11.374 line:93%
(He prepares for another interview.)

00:33:11.374 --> 00:33:12.444 line:93%
Goodness.

00:33:13.644 --> 00:33:15.745 line:93%
- Did you write it?
- Yes.

00:33:16.714 --> 00:33:19.184 line:93%
- You said what you had prepared.
- Yes.

00:33:19.924 --> 00:33:22.825 line:93%
I wrote it based on...

00:33:23.154 --> 00:33:24.355 line:93%
my real experience.

00:33:24.454 --> 00:33:25.724 line:93%
(He's impressed.)

00:33:25.724 --> 00:33:28.464 line:93%
This is a question for Mr. Haha.

00:33:28.464 --> 00:33:30.364 line:93%
Why do you want to work
at this company?

00:33:30.364 --> 00:33:32.295 line:93%
It's an amazing company.

00:33:32.295 --> 00:33:35.105 line:93%
All of you look great especially...

00:33:35.364 --> 00:33:37.835 line:93%
- you, sir.
- Thank you.

00:33:38.134 --> 00:33:40.444 line:93%
His sense of style is my ideal type.

00:33:40.775 --> 00:33:42.944 line:93%
You seem very casual.

00:33:42.944 --> 00:33:46.245 line:93%
To be honest,
I was surprised at first.

00:33:46.545 --> 00:33:49.485 line:93%
I feel that I belong here.

00:33:50.255 --> 00:33:54.154 line:93%
Could the other two
also answer the question?

00:33:54.825 --> 00:33:58.795 line:93%
I believe that
games are a modern way...

00:33:58.795 --> 00:34:01.124 line:93%
to contemplate.

00:34:01.795 --> 00:34:03.894 line:93%
I'm good at two things.

00:34:03.894 --> 00:34:06.464 line:93%
One is playing games,
and the other is...

00:34:06.464 --> 00:34:08.605 line:93%
entertaining people.

00:34:08.605 --> 00:34:11.904 line:93%
I'm good at playing games,
and I can make people laugh.

00:34:11.904 --> 00:34:13.505 line:93%
If I get to work here,

00:34:13.545 --> 00:34:16.874 line:93%
I can use my strengths
to the best of my ability.

00:34:17.874 --> 00:34:19.014 line:93%
(His answer was
unexpectedly serious.)

00:34:19.014 --> 00:34:22.445 line:93%
Is there something that you know...

00:34:22.445 --> 00:34:24.885 line:93%
but no one else knows?

00:34:24.885 --> 00:34:27.585 line:93%
Is there a truth that only you know?

00:34:27.925 --> 00:34:29.755 line:93%
It could be an imagination.

00:34:30.355 --> 00:34:32.025 line:93%
Tell us if you're
comfortable sharing it.

00:34:32.295 --> 00:34:34.965 line:93%
This is something that I imagine.

00:34:35.795 --> 00:34:38.664 line:93%
I imagine that each person
is considered...

00:34:38.764 --> 00:34:41.135 line:93%
a character by aliens.

00:34:41.505 --> 00:34:44.874 line:93%
If an alien buys happiness,
he gives happiness to his character.

00:34:44.874 --> 00:34:48.045 line:93%
If something goes wrong
due to too much happiness,

00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:51.144 line:93%
the alien gives hardship
to his character.

00:34:51.144 --> 00:34:54.115 line:93%
The alien tries to
balance the mood...

00:34:54.244 --> 00:34:56.885 line:93%
and raises his character.

00:34:56.914 --> 00:34:58.784 line:93%
During tough times,

00:34:59.054 --> 00:35:02.485 line:93%
I imagined that my master
is giving me a hard time.

00:35:02.655 --> 00:35:06.065 line:93%
When something good happens,
I imagine that my master...

00:35:06.065 --> 00:35:08.264 line:93%
is giving me happiness
after a hard time.

00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:10.094 line:93%
- Yes.
- I see.

00:35:10.094 --> 00:35:11.565 line:93%
I believe that...

00:35:12.295 --> 00:35:14.235 line:93%
we're given one chance.

00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.804 line:93%
It could be an ability
to stop the time.

00:35:17.835 --> 00:35:20.045 line:93%
I believe that teleportation exists.

00:35:21.545 --> 00:35:22.574 line:93%
(I see.)

00:35:22.574 --> 00:35:23.574 line:93%
Okay.

00:35:23.675 --> 00:35:25.474 line:93%
- I'm not lying.
- All right.

00:35:25.715 --> 00:35:26.885 line:93%
(He's not good with words.)

00:35:28.344 --> 00:35:30.655 line:93%
What you can see...

00:35:30.655 --> 00:35:32.824 line:93%
versus what's on the inside.

00:35:33.054 --> 00:35:36.954 line:93%
That could be how an idea starts.

00:35:36.954 --> 00:35:39.795 line:93%
I was impressed by Se Hyeong.

00:35:39.795 --> 00:35:41.164 line:93%
His idea was original.

00:35:42.124 --> 00:35:44.065 line:93%
Tell us your email address...

00:35:44.065 --> 00:35:46.804 line:93%
and explain why you decided to
use that email.

00:35:47.005 --> 00:35:50.905 line:93%
Whenever I tried to make an ID,
it said it was already in use,

00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:54.574 line:93%
so I typed Korean
on the English keyboard.

00:35:54.574 --> 00:35:56.974 line:93%
I wrote "No ID".

00:35:59.715 --> 00:36:01.284 line:93%
I tried it,
and it wasn't in use already.

00:36:01.744 --> 00:36:03.684 line:93%
We need to finish up.

00:36:04.014 --> 00:36:06.085 line:93%
Do you have any questions?

00:36:06.085 --> 00:36:09.855 line:93%
It can be about the interview
process or about the company.

00:36:10.655 --> 00:36:12.494 line:93%
(This is my last chance
to sell myself.)

00:36:13.425 --> 00:36:14.965 line:93%
(I need to seize this opportunity.)

00:36:14.965 --> 00:36:16.295 line:93%
- Sure.
- My question is...

00:36:16.365 --> 00:36:18.365 line:93%
(My question is...)

00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:22.405 line:93%
What question
would you like to be asked?

00:36:22.735 --> 00:36:24.505 line:93%
(I know this.)

00:36:25.405 --> 00:36:28.244 line:93%
(It was deemed the best question
a few specials ago.)

00:36:29.105 --> 00:36:31.775 line:93%
(What question would you like to
hear the most?)

00:36:32.474 --> 00:36:35.115 line:93%
(It's a satisfying question.)

00:36:35.115 --> 00:36:36.115 line:93%
Besides questions like that.

00:36:36.315 --> 00:36:38.284 line:93%
- Pardon?
- I didn't mean questions like that.

00:36:38.485 --> 00:36:40.224 line:93%
Then what I'm curious about is...

00:36:41.255 --> 00:36:42.255 line:93%
(He's bitter.)

00:36:43.195 --> 00:36:45.155 line:93%
(It's my turn to step back.)

00:36:45.594 --> 00:36:48.025 line:93%
This concludes the interview.

00:36:48.025 --> 00:36:49.094 line:93%
Thank you.

00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:50.764 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you for everything.

00:36:50.865 --> 00:36:52.034 line:93%
(He's reluctant.)

00:36:52.264 --> 00:36:53.565 line:93%
Thank you. You may leave.

00:36:53.565 --> 00:36:55.465 line:93%
After the interview,

00:36:55.465 --> 00:36:57.775 line:93%
I like this company even more.

00:36:57.775 --> 00:36:59.505 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:36:59.505 --> 00:37:00.775 line:93%
(He arranges the chairs as well.)

00:37:01.474 --> 00:37:02.545 line:93%
Take care.

00:37:02.775 --> 00:37:03.914 line:93%
Thanks. You too.

00:37:03.945 --> 00:37:05.115 line:93%
I'll take these.

00:37:05.574 --> 00:37:06.585 line:93%
Hey.

00:37:08.115 --> 00:37:10.115 line:93%
Take care. Thank you.

00:37:10.485 --> 00:37:11.485 line:93%
I love you.

00:37:11.684 --> 00:37:13.284 line:93%
I'll take you to the waiting room.

00:37:13.425 --> 00:37:14.425 line:93%
What do you think?

00:37:14.454 --> 00:37:15.525 line:93%
(They discuss the interviews.)

00:37:15.554 --> 00:37:17.894 line:93%
I liked Se Hyeong the most.

00:37:17.894 --> 00:37:21.124 line:93%
I like what he said,
and he was enthusiastic.

00:37:21.394 --> 00:37:23.264 line:93%
Haha was also enthusiastic,

00:37:23.264 --> 00:37:27.835 line:93%
but he doesn't know much
about games which is unfortunate.

00:37:28.235 --> 00:37:29.974 line:93%
(Waiting room)

00:37:30.405 --> 00:37:31.735 line:93%
(Spraying)

00:37:31.735 --> 00:37:33.474 line:93%
Stop spraying that.

00:37:33.945 --> 00:37:35.374 line:93%
It's all over your body.

00:37:35.374 --> 00:37:36.844 line:93%
I heard this one's good.

00:37:37.144 --> 00:37:38.374 line:93%
That question didn't work.

00:37:38.374 --> 00:37:40.744 line:93%
He's unbelievable.

00:37:41.744 --> 00:37:42.985 line:93%
What's wrong? Did he do anything?

00:37:42.985 --> 00:37:44.255 line:93%
He's incredible.

00:37:44.255 --> 00:37:46.054 line:93%
I just said whatever I wanted.

00:37:46.054 --> 00:37:48.525 line:93%
What's interesting is when you're
in there, you don't see the cameras.

00:37:48.525 --> 00:37:50.695 line:93%
- It feels like a real interview.
- That's right.

00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:52.894 line:93%
- In my head,
- You get desperate.

00:37:52.894 --> 00:37:56.295 line:93%
I keep telling myself
that I don't want to fail.

00:37:56.295 --> 00:37:58.764 line:93%
Coming this far...

00:37:59.135 --> 00:38:02.164 line:93%
is hard too.
People don't get the opportunity.

00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:04.605 line:93%
I want to go to Sangam MBC.

00:38:05.175 --> 00:38:07.905 line:93%
I'd rather get punched by
Pacquiao again.

00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:12.144 line:93%
We pay more attention
to the portfolio...

00:38:12.144 --> 00:38:15.644 line:93%
than the cover letter and
consider it more important.

00:38:16.014 --> 00:38:18.585 line:93%
Some people send thick documents...

00:38:18.585 --> 00:38:21.284 line:93%
saying that they came up
with new ideas for games.

00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:24.525 line:93%
They mention about
different tribes...

00:38:24.525 --> 00:38:26.624 line:93%
and some prince who did what.

00:38:26.624 --> 00:38:29.025 line:93%
They elaborate on that...

00:38:29.025 --> 00:38:30.065 line:93%
(They usually send long stories.)

00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:31.835 line:93%
The stories are very typical,

00:38:32.034 --> 00:38:35.204 line:93%
and we aren't interested at all.

00:38:35.235 --> 00:38:37.804 line:93%
Portfolio has to be
well-summarized...

00:38:37.874 --> 00:38:43.244 line:93%
in a few slides.
We consider that the best.

00:38:44.775 --> 00:38:46.744 line:93%
The next location is an IT company.

00:38:46.885 --> 00:38:48.215 line:93%
- It's that one.
- Right.

00:38:48.215 --> 00:38:51.284 line:93%
Stop going to IT companies.
I have a headache.

00:38:51.284 --> 00:38:52.355 line:93%
This one's more intense.

00:38:52.855 --> 00:38:55.255 line:93%
(Ace the Interview)

00:38:55.855 --> 00:38:57.255 line:93%
(They're in front of
the second company.)

00:38:57.255 --> 00:38:58.255 line:93%
This is refreshing.

00:38:58.255 --> 00:38:59.365 line:93%
It woke me up.

00:39:00.264 --> 00:39:01.264 line:93%
(It's a delivery service.)

00:39:01.264 --> 00:39:03.465 line:93%
- This must be it.
- I hope I make this one.

00:39:05.494 --> 00:39:08.105 line:93%
It feels different from
old companies.

00:39:08.105 --> 00:39:09.204 line:93%
(They look around
like it's a new house.)

00:39:09.204 --> 00:39:12.034 line:93%
This is nice.

00:39:12.235 --> 00:39:13.974 line:93%
(Don't order today's chicken
tomorrow.)

00:39:14.675 --> 00:39:16.945 line:93%
(They think outside the box.)

00:39:16.945 --> 00:39:18.414 line:93%
(You can't have that job forever.
Leave when you're at your peak.)

00:39:18.914 --> 00:39:21.215 line:93%
(There are no office desks.)

00:39:21.844 --> 00:39:24.215 line:93%
(Employees can work freely
as if they're in a coffee shop.)

00:39:24.855 --> 00:39:27.224 line:93%
(The waiting room
looks like a track.)

00:39:28.184 --> 00:39:29.894 line:93%
(Wash up before going to bed.)

00:39:30.094 --> 00:39:31.954 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:39:32.965 --> 00:39:33.965 line:93%
This is great.

00:39:34.494 --> 00:39:35.795 line:93%
Can we sit?

00:39:35.795 --> 00:39:37.494 line:93%
"Have a burning heart,
but watch your head."

00:39:37.494 --> 00:39:38.494 line:93%
(The atmosphere feels
liberal and unique.)

00:39:38.494 --> 00:39:39.505 line:93%
(Take a shower and sleep.)

00:39:39.505 --> 00:39:42.775 line:93%
It feels pretty relaxing.

00:39:42.775 --> 00:39:44.374 line:93%
- Don't get too nervous.
- Right.

00:39:44.374 --> 00:39:46.374 line:93%
I'm Lee Tae Young, the HR manager.

00:39:46.374 --> 00:39:47.505 line:93%
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:39:48.775 --> 00:39:51.574 line:93%
You'll be interviewed individually,

00:39:51.574 --> 00:39:54.045 line:93%
and there are
two interviewers inside.

00:39:54.045 --> 00:39:56.255 line:93%
- Okay.
- You'll start...

00:39:56.255 --> 00:40:00.224 line:93%
with a one-minute introduction.
Compare yourself to delivery food.

00:40:00.224 --> 00:40:01.755 line:93%
(This is a new type of
self-introduction.)

00:40:01.755 --> 00:40:03.594 line:93%
- Please express your idea.
- Delivery food?

00:40:03.594 --> 00:40:05.594 line:93%
- Delivery food.
- Yes, you're right.

00:40:05.594 --> 00:40:08.525 line:93%
For example, "I'm jokbal."

00:40:08.865 --> 00:40:11.565 line:93%
In five minutes,
I'll give you more instructions.

00:40:11.565 --> 00:40:14.335 line:93%
- Please take this time to think.
- Yes, thank you.

00:40:15.764 --> 00:40:18.204 line:93%
(They only have 5 minutes
to think of something.)

00:40:18.574 --> 00:40:20.005 line:93%
I thought about jokbal.

00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:21.105 line:93%
I'll do jjambbong.

00:40:21.105 --> 00:40:22.445 line:93%
I'll do pizza.

00:40:22.675 --> 00:40:24.244 line:93%
"Hello, I'm a chicken feet."

00:40:25.014 --> 00:40:26.744 line:93%
(The oldest member is...)

00:40:26.744 --> 00:40:28.585 line:93%
(a seasoned sea snail?)

00:40:29.485 --> 00:40:31.885 line:93%
(He's as focused as if he's looking
up the Bitcoin market price.)

00:40:34.385 --> 00:40:36.394 line:93%
Let's start with
Mr. Park Myeong Soo.

00:40:36.394 --> 00:40:37.394 line:93%
All right.

00:40:37.795 --> 00:40:38.795 line:93%
Let's go.

00:40:39.155 --> 00:40:40.195 line:93%
Good luck.

00:40:40.224 --> 00:40:42.465 line:93%
I think he'll do good.

00:40:43.264 --> 00:40:45.934 line:93%
The first person is Park Myeong Soo.

00:40:46.304 --> 00:40:47.865 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:40:47.865 --> 00:40:50.574 line:93%
(He looks at the interviewers
as he says hello.)

00:40:52.005 --> 00:40:53.874 line:93%
(The interviewers are
dressed casually.)

00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:55.574 line:93%
Please have a seat.

00:40:56.275 --> 00:40:57.374 line:93%
- Mr. Park Myeong Soo?
- Yes.

00:40:57.374 --> 00:40:59.815 line:93%
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:41:00.184 --> 00:41:02.885 line:93%
You'll be having an interview today.

00:41:02.885 --> 00:41:05.954 line:93%
I'm Park Il Han
who'll be interviewing you.

00:41:05.954 --> 00:41:06.954 line:93%
Nice to meet you.

00:41:06.954 --> 00:41:09.295 line:93%
I'm Han Myeong Soo.
We have the same name.

00:41:09.994 --> 00:41:12.324 line:93%
It's fate. It was meant to be.

00:41:12.525 --> 00:41:13.764 line:93%
You have to be more serious.

00:41:14.795 --> 00:41:16.735 line:93%
I'll try my best.

00:41:16.965 --> 00:41:18.235 line:93%
You prepared an introduction, right?

00:41:18.235 --> 00:41:20.465 line:93%
Yes, I had to take
a delivery food...

00:41:20.465 --> 00:41:21.534 line:93%
Hold on.

00:41:21.565 --> 00:41:24.405 line:93%
Instead of that,

00:41:24.405 --> 00:41:26.675 line:93%
I want to hear something
you didn't prepare.

00:41:27.874 --> 00:41:29.175 line:93%
- Something I didn't prepare?
- Yes.

00:41:30.045 --> 00:41:32.945 line:93%
If you prepare them ahead of time,
it's boring.

00:41:34.014 --> 00:41:37.485 line:93%
Just tell us who you are.

00:41:37.485 --> 00:41:38.885 line:93%
(He's moving his feet because
he's nervous.)

00:41:39.054 --> 00:41:40.525 line:93%
Look at his feet.

00:41:40.525 --> 00:41:42.525 line:93%
- He's like Michael Jackson.
- It's no joke.

00:41:42.525 --> 00:41:44.124 line:93%
He's Michael Jackson.

00:41:44.124 --> 00:41:45.124 line:93%
(This moonwalk doesn't look normal.)

00:41:46.264 --> 00:41:47.594 line:93%
(He starts scratching himself
out of nervousness.)

00:41:47.594 --> 00:41:48.664 line:93%
I am...

00:41:49.164 --> 00:41:50.865 line:93%
full of confidence.

00:41:50.865 --> 00:41:54.065 line:93%
I'm sorry. It's what got me here,

00:41:54.405 --> 00:41:56.135 line:93%
and I always started...

00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:58.005 line:93%
with confidence.

00:41:58.074 --> 00:42:01.005 line:93%
I'm not really nervous today either.

00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:05.275 line:93%
I want to be confident
and tell you how motivated I am.

00:42:05.474 --> 00:42:07.844 line:93%
Do you have your own way
of resolving a conflict?

00:42:07.844 --> 00:42:10.655 line:93%
Is it better to be good at something
or work hard?

00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:13.124 line:93%
Do fried chickens sell better
seasoned or unseasoned?

00:42:13.184 --> 00:42:16.155 line:93%
What words can we put on this
to make it funny?

00:42:16.394 --> 00:42:17.594 line:93%
(Smiling)

00:42:18.695 --> 00:42:20.295 line:93%
(He said he was confident,
but he can't speak.)

00:42:21.394 --> 00:42:22.735 line:93%
(Typing)

00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:25.195 line:93%
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:42:25.195 --> 00:42:26.204 line:93%
Hello.

00:42:26.505 --> 00:42:30.735 line:93%
What are some items that were
most delivered by our company?

00:42:30.735 --> 00:42:32.505 line:93%
Think about single items.

00:42:32.505 --> 00:42:33.505 line:93%
You can consider any food.

00:42:33.505 --> 00:42:35.275 line:93%
For yesterday's dinner,

00:42:35.744 --> 00:42:37.244 line:93%
- I ordered jokbal.
- Okay.

00:42:37.244 --> 00:42:38.574 line:93%
(And?)

00:42:38.574 --> 00:42:40.885 line:93%
I don't think
that's the right answer.

00:42:41.244 --> 00:42:44.184 line:93%
I think it might be tteokbokki
or chicken feet.

00:42:44.184 --> 00:42:46.284 line:93%
- People like late-night snacks.
- Hold on.

00:42:46.885 --> 00:42:48.155 line:93%
I'll go with tteokbokki.

00:42:48.885 --> 00:42:50.124 line:93%
I think it's right.

00:42:50.195 --> 00:42:52.224 line:93%
Can't you make it at home too?

00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:55.465 line:93%
But it tastes different...

00:42:55.795 --> 00:42:56.894 line:93%
from homemade ones.

00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:58.494 line:93%
All right.

00:42:58.494 --> 00:43:00.034 line:93%
(Did they laugh
because it was good?)

00:43:01.264 --> 00:43:03.204 line:93%
(What was the point
of that question?)

00:43:04.074 --> 00:43:08.874 line:93%
We wanted to see
what his thoughts were.

00:43:08.945 --> 00:43:11.715 line:93%
We also wanted him
to explain logically.

00:43:12.175 --> 00:43:14.914 line:93%
If you choose one thing,

00:43:15.144 --> 00:43:16.684 line:93%
you shouldn't end it there.

00:43:16.684 --> 00:43:19.054 line:93%
You need to provide a reason...

00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:21.554 line:93%
and convince me with that.

00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:23.724 line:93%
That's what we wanted to check.

00:43:24.394 --> 00:43:25.594 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:43:25.594 --> 00:43:27.494 line:93%
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

00:43:27.494 --> 00:43:28.695 line:93%
- Please have a seat.
- Okay. Hello.

00:43:28.695 --> 00:43:31.835 line:93%
Choose one item
that gets the most delivery request.

00:43:31.835 --> 00:43:32.865 line:93%
Chicken!

00:43:33.465 --> 00:43:35.005 line:93%
Why do you think so?

00:43:35.065 --> 00:43:36.335 line:93%
You're so certain.

00:43:36.335 --> 00:43:37.335 line:93%
Isn't it chicken?

00:43:37.874 --> 00:43:41.175 line:93%
When you look at rankings,

00:43:41.175 --> 00:43:45.275 line:93%
chicken is always number one
for late-night snacks.

00:43:45.675 --> 00:43:47.244 line:93%
- Then,
- I might be wrong.

00:43:47.244 --> 00:43:49.144 line:93%
you mentioned chicken,

00:43:49.144 --> 00:43:52.355 line:93%
so do Koreans eat more fried chicken
seasoned or unseasoned?

00:43:53.525 --> 00:43:55.054 line:93%
(He hesitates
instead of jumping into it.)

00:43:55.784 --> 00:43:57.025 line:93%
(They're looking forward
to his answer.)

00:43:57.454 --> 00:43:58.795 line:93%
I think it's seasoned.

00:43:59.054 --> 00:44:00.124 line:93%
- Why?
- How so?

00:44:01.264 --> 00:44:05.264 line:93%
When you eat late-night snacks,

00:44:05.264 --> 00:44:08.835 line:93%
sweet food makes you relax.

00:44:08.835 --> 00:44:11.105 line:93%
- It gets rid of your stress.
- Right.

00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:12.775 line:93%
All right.

00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:14.505 line:93%
(He explained calmly with reasons.)

00:44:14.874 --> 00:44:19.215 line:93%
What areas do you think
deliver the most?

00:44:19.284 --> 00:44:20.985 line:93%
I've read some articles,

00:44:21.014 --> 00:44:23.315 line:93%
and I believe that areas where there
are many single person households...

00:44:23.315 --> 00:44:24.414 line:93%
order delivery a lot.

00:44:24.414 --> 00:44:26.755 line:93%
- All right.
- For example?

00:44:26.885 --> 00:44:29.855 line:93%
Near colleges...

00:44:29.894 --> 00:44:33.695 line:93%
or near companies.

00:44:33.695 --> 00:44:36.264 line:93%
- So places with those attributes?
- Yes.

00:44:36.264 --> 00:44:37.264 line:93%
(These people live by themselves.)

00:44:37.264 --> 00:44:40.065 line:93%
- You think it's those areas?
- I think so.

00:44:41.335 --> 00:44:43.005 line:93%
I think the three of us
work well together.

00:44:43.005 --> 00:44:44.005 line:93%
Is that right?

00:44:44.005 --> 00:44:46.074 line:93%
- Thank you for caring about us.
- Thank you.

00:44:46.074 --> 00:44:48.105 line:93%
- You have a great leadership.
- No, that's not true.

00:44:48.105 --> 00:44:49.374 line:93%
I think you could be
an executive member.

00:44:49.374 --> 00:44:50.675 line:93%
You're too kind.

00:44:50.675 --> 00:44:51.775 line:93%
I don't think so.

00:44:51.775 --> 00:44:53.315 line:93%
You don't think so?
You're modest too.

00:44:53.315 --> 00:44:54.914 line:93%
I mean it.

00:44:55.514 --> 00:44:58.514 line:93%
Let's conclude the interview here.

00:44:58.514 --> 00:44:59.755 line:93%
- Good work.
- Thank you.

00:44:59.755 --> 00:45:01.155 line:93%
- Good work.
- Thank you.

00:45:01.155 --> 00:45:02.425 line:93%
- Take care.
- Bye.

00:45:02.425 --> 00:45:03.855 line:93%
Thank you.

00:45:03.855 --> 00:45:05.795 line:93%
(The interview was like
a relaxed conversation.)

00:45:06.594 --> 00:45:08.594 line:93%
He was smooth and talked well.

00:45:08.594 --> 00:45:11.494 line:93%
When we asked about what areas
get the most deliveries,

00:45:11.494 --> 00:45:14.465 line:93%
he guessed the right attributes.
Instead of guessing the towns...

00:45:14.465 --> 00:45:17.505 line:93%
and asking us if it's
Yeoksam-dong or Nonhyeon-dong,

00:45:17.505 --> 00:45:20.204 line:93%
he took a moment to think.
I liked that.

00:45:20.405 --> 00:45:22.844 line:93%
He knows how to catch
an important point.

00:45:23.045 --> 00:45:25.315 line:93%
Even if the interviewer is kind,
the interview itself is stressful.

00:45:25.315 --> 00:45:26.514 line:93%
(It's stressful because they don't
know the results.)

00:45:26.514 --> 00:45:27.585 line:93%
This is very tiring.

00:45:27.585 --> 00:45:29.655 line:93%
I think this place is an idea.

00:45:29.784 --> 00:45:30.985 line:93%
This suits me very well.

00:45:30.985 --> 00:45:32.085 line:93%
(Those who messed up
show confidence.)

00:45:32.085 --> 00:45:33.355 line:93%
I think I'm hired.

00:45:34.655 --> 00:45:35.684 line:93%
(The next interviewee is
Sae Ho.)

00:45:35.684 --> 00:45:36.855 line:93%
He's here.

00:45:36.855 --> 00:45:38.724 line:93%
(He stopped right before
entering the door.)

00:45:42.635 --> 00:45:44.465 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:45:44.465 --> 00:45:45.664 line:93%
Have you ordered food delivery?

00:45:46.865 --> 00:45:48.304 line:93%
Yes, I have.

00:45:48.304 --> 00:45:50.905 line:93%
The talented individual is here.

00:45:51.974 --> 00:45:53.005 line:93%
Nice to meet you.

00:45:53.874 --> 00:45:55.275 line:93%
Yes, Mr. Cho Sae Ho.

00:45:55.275 --> 00:45:56.545 line:93%
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:57.815 line:93%
I'm Cho Sae Ho.

00:45:57.815 --> 00:45:58.974 line:93%
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

00:45:58.974 --> 00:46:00.844 line:93%
Please introduce yourself.

00:46:01.244 --> 00:46:04.585 line:93%
I have a nickname.
People call me a traveler.

00:46:04.585 --> 00:46:06.025 line:93%
- A traveler?
- If somebody calls me,

00:46:06.025 --> 00:46:07.985 line:93%
I'd go anywhere with my
travel luggage.

00:46:08.255 --> 00:46:09.454 line:93%
I'd like to settle down here with...

00:46:09.454 --> 00:46:11.025 line:93%
my luggage.

00:46:11.454 --> 00:46:14.025 line:93%
Why does he keep talking
about being a traveler?

00:46:14.025 --> 00:46:16.065 line:93%
- That was the hottest keyword.
- I know,

00:46:16.065 --> 00:46:18.335 line:93%
but he doesn't know how to conclude
when he talks about it.

00:46:18.465 --> 00:46:20.534 line:93%
- What is in your travel luggage?
- It has...

00:46:22.135 --> 00:46:23.304 line:93%
my passion,

00:46:23.574 --> 00:46:24.934 line:93%
my ambition,

00:46:25.374 --> 00:46:26.804 line:93%
and other things in it.

00:46:26.874 --> 00:46:29.215 line:93%
If you unpack the luggage and
see what's inside...

00:46:29.775 --> 00:46:33.014 line:93%
you'll realize that it was a good
decision for you to have me.

00:46:33.014 --> 00:46:34.784 line:93%
Since when did you start carrying
the travel luggage?

00:46:34.784 --> 00:46:36.215 line:93%
(He's flustered to be asked
about the travel luggage.)

00:46:36.215 --> 00:46:39.755 line:93%
I've carried it since 2001.

00:46:40.054 --> 00:46:43.695 line:93%
The travel luggage has many
stories about me.

00:46:44.094 --> 00:46:46.324 line:93%
I'd like to unpack my travel
luggage here and...

00:46:47.224 --> 00:46:48.664 line:93%
play well.

00:46:49.065 --> 00:46:52.565 line:93%
Why would you play well
here in our company?

00:46:52.565 --> 00:46:54.465 line:93%
(He's taken aback.)

00:46:55.005 --> 00:46:56.905 line:93%
The thing that I'm best at
is playing.

00:46:56.905 --> 00:46:58.235 line:93%
I do playing things well.

00:46:58.335 --> 00:47:01.505 line:93%
So if I think going to work is
like playing,

00:47:01.505 --> 00:47:03.374 line:93%
I'd do well in your company too.

00:47:03.744 --> 00:47:05.344 line:93%
Work like you play?

00:47:05.445 --> 00:47:08.545 line:93%
Will the tasks be done well
if you treat it like you're playing?

00:47:10.115 --> 00:47:11.315 line:93%
I'm just curious.

00:47:13.124 --> 00:47:17.494 line:93%
(He keeps giving answers
without a point.)

00:47:17.824 --> 00:47:19.264 line:93%
When do you feel happy?

00:47:19.394 --> 00:47:20.425 line:93%
- Me?
- Yes.

00:47:20.425 --> 00:47:21.824 line:93%
To be honest,

00:47:21.824 --> 00:47:24.164 line:93%
I feel happy when I'm at home
in my underwear...

00:47:24.434 --> 00:47:25.905 line:93%
with a nice cold beer...

00:47:26.204 --> 00:47:28.905 line:93%
and a plate of hot chicken,

00:47:29.405 --> 00:47:30.605 line:93%
and nothing else.

00:47:30.605 --> 00:47:32.675 line:93%
You said you feel happy when
you have hot chicken.

00:47:32.675 --> 00:47:34.874 line:93%
- Do you like chicken?
- Yes, I do.

00:47:34.974 --> 00:47:37.545 line:93%
There was this professor in
my university.

00:47:38.115 --> 00:47:40.514 line:93%
(He keeps talking about
something not important.)

00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:45.615 line:93%
(Sae Ho keeps answering
without a point.)

00:47:45.925 --> 00:47:46.925 line:93%
So I asked...

00:47:46.925 --> 00:47:48.824 line:93%
if you like chicken?

00:47:49.025 --> 00:47:50.355 line:93%
Yes, I like chicken.

00:47:51.054 --> 00:47:52.664 line:93%
I asked if you like chicken.

00:47:52.664 --> 00:47:54.795 line:93%
- You answered something else.
- Right. I'm sorry.

00:47:55.025 --> 00:47:57.235 line:93%
I tried to tell a different story
about me.

00:47:58.934 --> 00:48:00.804 line:93%
Let's say...

00:48:00.905 --> 00:48:03.405 line:93%
you have a thousand dollars,

00:48:03.405 --> 00:48:06.704 line:93%
- and you want to start a business.
- Okay.

00:48:06.844 --> 00:48:09.874 line:93%
What kind of start-ups do you
think you can do?

00:48:10.514 --> 00:48:11.744 line:93%
With a thousand dollars.

00:48:12.744 --> 00:48:15.585 line:93%
I'd like to buy a nice suit.

00:48:15.985 --> 00:48:17.284 line:93%
- Suit?
- Right.

00:48:17.284 --> 00:48:18.885 line:93%
I'd like to buy a nice suit
that costs a thousand dollars.

00:48:19.054 --> 00:48:20.585 line:93%
- Right.
- With that suit...

00:48:20.824 --> 00:48:23.795 line:93%
I'd knock anywhere to
start up something.

00:48:24.025 --> 00:48:25.355 line:93%
It has always been...

00:48:26.465 --> 00:48:27.724 line:93%
(Curious)

00:48:27.724 --> 00:48:28.994 line:93%
Let me re-think.

00:48:29.065 --> 00:48:30.135 line:93%
(Let me think about it again.)

00:48:30.695 --> 00:48:32.434 line:93%
When you said that I had
a thousand dollars,

00:48:32.465 --> 00:48:35.034 line:93%
I was reminded of a suit
I wanted to get.

00:48:35.034 --> 00:48:36.434 line:93%
- There was a suit you saw.
- Yes.

00:48:36.434 --> 00:48:38.874 line:93%
I really wanted to buy it when you
mentioned a thousand dollars.

00:48:38.874 --> 00:48:40.574 line:93%
- I like how you're honest.
- Right.

00:48:41.105 --> 00:48:42.474 line:93%
I can't lie.

00:48:42.474 --> 00:48:43.644 line:93%
(Trying hard)

00:48:43.874 --> 00:48:47.945 line:93%
Let's say if you are informed
that you didn't make this interview,

00:48:47.945 --> 00:48:51.014 line:93%
what do you think is the reason
that you didn't pass?

00:48:51.155 --> 00:48:52.885 line:93%
I think it would have been
that thousand dollars.

00:48:52.885 --> 00:48:54.624 line:93%
(Because of the thousand dollars)

00:48:54.624 --> 00:48:56.054 line:93%
- I see.
- Right.

00:48:56.054 --> 00:48:58.195 line:93%
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

00:48:58.195 --> 00:49:00.195 line:93%
- I'd leave now.
- Yes, goodbye.

00:49:00.894 --> 00:49:02.565 line:93%
Did you go to some talk concert?

00:49:02.565 --> 00:49:03.664 line:93%
- What are you doing?
- What did you do?

00:49:03.664 --> 00:49:05.695 line:93%
- Your answers were overloaded.
- No, they weren't.

00:49:05.764 --> 00:49:06.865 line:93%
How do you feel?

00:49:08.005 --> 00:49:09.164 line:93%
I think I passed.

00:49:09.164 --> 00:49:12.005 line:93%
(He counts his chickens
before they've hatched.)

00:49:12.474 --> 00:49:13.605 line:93%
It was tough.

00:49:13.605 --> 00:49:14.874 line:93%
(It was tough.)

00:49:15.275 --> 00:49:17.275 line:93%
Why am I tired? I only listened.

00:49:17.974 --> 00:49:19.744 line:93%
He interpreted our questions...

00:49:19.885 --> 00:49:21.784 line:93%
in his own ways.

00:49:22.085 --> 00:49:25.485 line:93%
He wanted to take the lead
on the interview.

00:49:25.684 --> 00:49:27.925 line:93%
But when he does what he wants
to do, he'd do well.

00:49:28.425 --> 00:49:30.224 line:93%
- That's more difficult.
- If there's no reaction,

00:49:30.624 --> 00:49:31.855 line:93%
he'd feel sad.

00:49:31.855 --> 00:49:32.994 line:93%
But most importantly,

00:49:33.664 --> 00:49:36.065 line:93%
he doesn't go well with us.

00:49:36.065 --> 00:49:37.994 line:93%
- There's the last person.
- He's the last one.

00:49:39.565 --> 00:49:41.534 line:93%
He's the youngest.

00:49:41.534 --> 00:49:42.675 line:93%
Yes.

00:49:43.934 --> 00:49:47.605 line:93%
(Young blood is on his way.)

00:49:48.704 --> 00:49:51.144 line:93%
(Child Se Hyeong is here.)

00:49:51.144 --> 00:49:52.474 line:93%
(They're having headache.)

00:49:53.144 --> 00:49:54.744 line:93%
(He's shocked.)

00:49:56.885 --> 00:49:58.085 line:93%
What is he doing?

00:49:58.355 --> 00:49:59.425 line:93%
This...

00:49:59.485 --> 00:50:01.054 line:93%
This...

00:50:01.155 --> 00:50:03.554 line:93%
- This is a replay of the shark.
- This is...

00:50:03.855 --> 00:50:06.264 line:93%
Goodbye to the previous
interviewees!

00:50:06.394 --> 00:50:07.494 line:93%
I'm the interviewee who's ready!

00:50:07.494 --> 00:50:11.434 line:93%
Happy. Refreshing. Delightful.

00:50:11.434 --> 00:50:13.135 line:93%
(They can't even look him in
the eyes.)

00:50:13.135 --> 00:50:14.505 line:93%
I'm the real one.

00:50:14.505 --> 00:50:15.974 line:93%
(The real child who's running
for the election is here.)

00:50:16.235 --> 00:50:17.934 line:93%
I'm the interviewee 237,
Yang Se Hyeong!

00:50:17.934 --> 00:50:19.005 line:93%
(Interviewee: Yang Se Hyeong)

00:50:20.175 --> 00:50:21.545 line:93%
Thank you for your entrance.

00:50:21.545 --> 00:50:22.744 line:93%
- Yes.
- Take a seat.

00:50:22.874 --> 00:50:24.974 line:93%
You made me lose my mind.
Let me regain my focus.

00:50:24.974 --> 00:50:26.045 line:93%
I thought you would be tired.

00:50:26.045 --> 00:50:28.744 line:93%
It was embarrassing,
but I did it to refresh the mood.

00:50:28.744 --> 00:50:30.184 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:50:30.184 --> 00:50:31.855 line:93%
- My pleasure.
- It is encouraging.

00:50:32.014 --> 00:50:34.355 line:93%
Can you tell me about yourself
as a regular person?

00:50:36.454 --> 00:50:39.594 line:93%
On TV, I'm portrayed as a person...

00:50:39.764 --> 00:50:43.494 line:93%
who is bright and cheerful.

00:50:43.695 --> 00:50:47.534 line:93%
I'm usually quiet and emotional.

00:50:47.865 --> 00:50:49.974 line:93%
I read poems.

00:50:49.974 --> 00:50:52.974 line:93%
I like writing poems alone.

00:50:52.974 --> 00:50:55.344 line:93%
I'm a whole different person
on the stage.

00:50:55.344 --> 00:50:56.474 line:93%
(He delivers the answers calmly.)

00:50:57.344 --> 00:50:59.385 line:93%
When you're emotional,

00:50:59.445 --> 00:51:02.885 line:93%
isn't it hard for you to control it?

00:51:03.085 --> 00:51:06.184 line:93%
I have a habit of being mad when...

00:51:06.184 --> 00:51:08.925 line:93%
I feel like my pride
as been scratched.

00:51:08.925 --> 00:51:12.994 line:93%
I recently read a book called
"Rage".

00:51:12.994 --> 00:51:14.865 line:93%
Learning to control my temper...

00:51:14.865 --> 00:51:17.695 line:93%
will make my life happier.

00:51:17.695 --> 00:51:18.865 line:93%
After I read that book,

00:51:18.865 --> 00:51:21.304 line:93%
when I began to admit the fact,
I don't get mad anymore.

00:51:21.664 --> 00:51:22.775 line:93%
That is how...

00:51:22.775 --> 00:51:24.605 line:93%
control it and sleep well.

00:51:24.905 --> 00:51:26.005 line:93%
- Right.
- Yes, that's me.

00:51:26.775 --> 00:51:30.644 line:93%
When do you think has the most
number of orders in a year?

00:51:31.175 --> 00:51:32.985 line:93%
Let me think.

00:51:33.014 --> 00:51:36.184 line:93%
I think it should be either the
beginning or the end of the year.

00:51:36.255 --> 00:51:37.784 line:93%
Why do you think of it that way?

00:51:37.985 --> 00:51:40.784 line:93%
There are many married men
and women who work.

00:51:40.784 --> 00:51:43.255 line:93%
They're all busy.

00:51:43.594 --> 00:51:44.795 line:93%
But no matter how busy they are,

00:51:44.795 --> 00:51:47.565 line:93%
they try to spend time with family
at the end or beginning of the year.

00:51:47.565 --> 00:51:50.135 line:93%
I feel like families promise
to do that.

00:51:50.494 --> 00:51:52.534 line:93%
So they'd order food during
the festive days.

00:51:52.905 --> 00:51:54.465 line:93%
- They'd order?
- Yes.

00:51:54.835 --> 00:51:56.204 line:93%
I think it happens like that.

00:51:56.204 --> 00:51:57.374 line:93%
- I see.
- Okay.

00:51:57.474 --> 00:51:59.675 line:93%
How could you make people happy...

00:51:59.675 --> 00:52:02.505 line:93%
with this pair of slippers?

00:52:02.914 --> 00:52:04.545 line:93%
- With this?
- Yes.

00:52:04.744 --> 00:52:05.914 line:93%
Let me think.

00:52:09.385 --> 00:52:11.355 line:93%
(He's trying to think of something
cheerful with it.)

00:52:12.014 --> 00:52:13.454 line:93%
(They're expecting a lot.)

00:52:14.755 --> 00:52:18.394 line:93%
(He's taking his time to think
of something innovative.)

00:52:18.394 --> 00:52:19.994 line:93%
Knock. Knock. Knock.
Excuse me, I'm a slipper.

00:52:19.994 --> 00:52:21.164 line:93%
But this is too childish.

00:52:21.164 --> 00:52:22.994 line:93%
Knock. Knock. Knock.
Excuse me, I'm a slipper.

00:52:22.994 --> 00:52:24.195 line:93%
- Wow.
- I can think of something else.

00:52:24.235 --> 00:52:25.235 line:93%
No, it's fun.

00:52:25.295 --> 00:52:26.865 line:93%
But this does sound childish.

00:52:26.865 --> 00:52:28.105 line:93%
No, it doesn't sound childish.

00:52:28.105 --> 00:52:29.635 line:93%
This delivered your objective.

00:52:29.635 --> 00:52:31.105 line:93%
Excuse me. I'm a slipper.

00:52:31.105 --> 00:52:32.874 line:93%
- It gives me two meanings.
- Yes.

00:52:33.374 --> 00:52:34.505 line:93%
I like it.

00:52:34.945 --> 00:52:36.474 line:93%
But you're not happy with it.

00:52:36.474 --> 00:52:38.014 line:93%
- You don't like it.
- No.

00:52:38.175 --> 00:52:40.445 line:93%
I think there will be
something better.

00:52:40.445 --> 00:52:41.945 line:93%
Even if I don't make it here,

00:52:41.945 --> 00:52:44.485 line:93%
I'd post up my idea on your website.

00:52:44.954 --> 00:52:46.025 line:93%
I'll upload my idea.

00:52:46.124 --> 00:52:47.385 line:93%
Okay. Thank you.

00:52:47.684 --> 00:52:49.755 line:93%
Thank you for your time.

00:52:49.755 --> 00:52:51.255 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

00:52:51.255 --> 00:52:53.295 line:93%
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

00:52:54.925 --> 00:52:56.195 line:93%
I like him.

00:52:56.195 --> 00:52:57.335 line:93%
(He feels good about him.)

00:52:57.335 --> 00:52:58.365 line:93%
For me...

00:52:58.365 --> 00:53:00.164 line:93%
I think he tried hard to show
that he's serious.

00:53:00.405 --> 00:53:03.235 line:93%
- He tried to show that...
- Okay.

00:53:03.235 --> 00:53:05.605 line:93%
- he's a different person from TV.
- Okay.

00:53:05.835 --> 00:53:06.874 line:93%
Basically...

00:53:07.244 --> 00:53:09.945 line:93%
he has good senses and
observation skills.

00:53:09.945 --> 00:53:11.144 line:93%
- He's good at observing.
- Yes.

00:53:11.275 --> 00:53:14.485 line:93%
- I saw many good sides of him.
- Okay.

00:53:15.144 --> 00:53:18.014 line:93%
I think he could become
a good leader.

00:53:18.014 --> 00:53:19.824 line:93%
I like him very much.

00:53:19.824 --> 00:53:22.155 line:93%
Jae Seok had leadership.

00:53:22.724 --> 00:53:24.795 line:93%
But Se Hyeong showed many
good sides of him.

00:53:24.994 --> 00:53:26.295 line:93%
So I like him.

00:53:26.994 --> 00:53:31.335 line:93%
I'd give a pass to Jae Seok
and Se Hyeong.

00:53:31.394 --> 00:53:33.635 line:93%
The rest of them didn't make it.

00:53:36.934 --> 00:53:38.034 line:93%
Goodness.

00:53:38.775 --> 00:53:39.905 line:93%
We have to go to a business trip.

00:53:39.905 --> 00:53:41.844 line:93%
Yes, we have to go
to our last interview.

00:53:41.974 --> 00:53:43.374 line:93%
This is our last time.

00:53:43.374 --> 00:53:45.215 line:93%
Isn't this a professional traveler?

00:53:45.215 --> 00:53:46.885 line:93%
Yes, this is the traveler.

00:53:47.244 --> 00:53:48.445 line:93%
- Let's all go.
- Let's go.

00:53:48.945 --> 00:53:51.014 line:93%
(They're moving to the next
interview.)

00:53:51.014 --> 00:53:52.155 line:93%
Goodness. We got to go.

00:53:53.655 --> 00:53:56.054 line:93%
(Ace the Interview)

00:53:56.054 --> 00:53:57.755 line:93%
Let's go. Let's go.

00:53:57.755 --> 00:53:59.025 line:93%
I feel confident now.

00:53:59.025 --> 00:54:00.124 line:93%
This is the last one.

00:54:00.295 --> 00:54:03.335 line:93%
We're the actual travelers.

00:54:03.335 --> 00:54:05.795 line:93%
This doesn't feel like we're
shooting.

00:54:05.795 --> 00:54:07.735 line:93%
I feel like we're actually taking
interviews.

00:54:07.735 --> 00:54:09.735 line:93%
This is about breaking the
interviews.

00:54:10.474 --> 00:54:11.905 line:93%
The places we have been today...

00:54:11.905 --> 00:54:13.574 line:93%
are not small companies.

00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:17.045 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:54:17.175 --> 00:54:18.315 line:93%
- Wow.
- This place is big.

00:54:18.744 --> 00:54:20.485 line:93%
- There are things we like.
- It's all here.

00:54:20.485 --> 00:54:21.945 line:93%
(Korea's first confectionery
company. H company.)

00:54:24.215 --> 00:54:26.655 line:93%
- I feel good, though.
- I feel so much better.

00:54:26.655 --> 00:54:28.954 line:93%
- This feels like home.
- Yes, I'm not kidding.

00:54:28.985 --> 00:54:30.224 line:93%
There are many stories
about snacks.

00:54:30.295 --> 00:54:31.795 line:93%
Aren't there many stories
about snacks?

00:54:31.894 --> 00:54:33.925 line:93%
- We have many stories.
- There are lots.

00:54:35.365 --> 00:54:36.764 line:93%
- This is the waiting place.
- Goodness.

00:54:36.865 --> 00:54:37.934 line:93%
Goodness.

00:54:37.934 --> 00:54:39.965 line:93%
I'll tell you the order
of seat arrangements. Yu Jae Seok.

00:54:40.365 --> 00:54:41.434 line:93%
Come this way, please.

00:54:41.434 --> 00:54:43.005 line:93%
- Nice to meet you.
- Yang Se Hyeong.

00:54:43.074 --> 00:54:44.235 line:93%
- Yes.
- Come this way.

00:54:44.235 --> 00:54:45.374 line:93%
Are we taking an exam?

00:54:45.374 --> 00:54:46.474 line:93%
- No, it's the identification slip.
- Cho Sae Ho.

00:54:46.474 --> 00:54:47.545 line:93%
- Hello.
- You can sit here.

00:54:47.545 --> 00:54:49.615 line:93%
Jung Jun Ha.
Come to the front.

00:54:50.344 --> 00:54:51.514 line:93%
It's the marketing team.

00:54:53.344 --> 00:54:55.815 line:93%
(Everyone is taking their seat.)

00:54:56.184 --> 00:54:57.255 line:93%
(He's nervous.)

00:54:57.914 --> 00:55:00.255 line:93%
(They feel pressured
for some reason.)

00:55:00.255 --> 00:55:02.655 line:93%
We were cheerful at the
entrance.

00:55:03.954 --> 00:55:06.324 line:93%
We're nervous inside.

00:55:06.565 --> 00:55:08.795 line:93%
(It's their third interview,
but it still makes them nervous.)

00:55:10.594 --> 00:55:14.135 line:93%
Now, we'll conduct the interview
for marketing team.

00:55:14.135 --> 00:55:17.835 line:93%
We'll start with basic capability
assessment on the work.

00:55:18.135 --> 00:55:19.605 line:93%
The basic capability assessment
on the work includes...

00:55:19.804 --> 00:55:23.574 line:93%
economics, knowledge on
current events, and creativity.

00:55:23.574 --> 00:55:25.715 line:93%
It's a written test that measures...

00:55:25.914 --> 00:55:28.414 line:93%
your basic capabilities.

00:55:29.115 --> 00:55:31.615 line:93%
In the second part,

00:55:31.615 --> 00:55:33.324 line:93%
you will have an interview...

00:55:33.324 --> 00:55:35.025 line:93%
that is based on the resume...

00:55:35.025 --> 00:55:37.894 line:93%
you turned in when you applied.

00:55:38.394 --> 00:55:40.525 line:93%
I will distribute the test.

00:55:40.724 --> 00:55:42.735 line:93%
- Are we really taking a test?
- Really?

00:55:42.894 --> 00:55:44.835 line:93%
We entered excitedly.

00:55:45.164 --> 00:55:47.335 line:93%
- We thought we would have snacks.
- This is wrong.

00:55:47.635 --> 00:55:48.934 line:93%
Thank you.

00:55:49.135 --> 00:55:50.675 line:93%
Thank you.

00:55:50.675 --> 00:55:51.874 line:93%
This is...

00:55:52.074 --> 00:55:53.974 line:93%
We thought we would have snacks.

00:55:54.304 --> 00:55:58.144 line:93%
Attach your identification slip
on your left chest.

00:55:58.474 --> 00:56:00.244 line:93%
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:56:04.085 --> 00:56:05.355 line:93%
What is this?

00:56:05.385 --> 00:56:07.155 line:93%
- My goodness.
- What is this?

00:56:07.425 --> 00:56:10.554 line:93%
Why do I need to know
about the three primary colors?

00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:14.965 line:93%
(He misses his mom
even before the interview.)

00:56:15.865 --> 00:56:17.465 line:93%
(He gathers his wits
and reads the questions carefully.)

00:56:18.534 --> 00:56:19.804 line:93%
(The first question of the exam
is difficult.)

00:56:19.804 --> 00:56:22.405 line:93%
(The answer is number 2.)

00:56:22.405 --> 00:56:23.804 line:93%
This is a disaster.

00:56:23.804 --> 00:56:26.304 line:93%
(Even the smart member
gets it wrong.)

00:56:27.105 --> 00:56:29.414 line:93%
(He lost his mind.)

00:56:30.844 --> 00:56:32.014 line:93%
(Thinking)

00:56:32.414 --> 00:56:34.244 line:93%
Red is definitely a primary color.

00:56:35.115 --> 00:56:37.054 line:93%
Red. Red.

00:56:37.715 --> 00:56:39.784 line:93%
Red, green, blue.

00:56:40.454 --> 00:56:44.324 line:93%
(With the mind of a job seeker,
they do their best.)

00:56:45.525 --> 00:56:48.264 line:93%
(They look like they are taking
a test for a promotion.)

00:56:50.795 --> 00:56:52.394 line:93%
- Five minutes remain.
- Excuse me?

00:56:52.394 --> 00:56:54.065 line:93%
- What?
- Five minutes?

00:56:54.065 --> 00:56:55.704 line:93%
- Yes.
- Hold on.

00:56:55.835 --> 00:56:57.534 line:93%
- Sir, did you say five minutes?
- Yes.

00:56:59.034 --> 00:57:01.744 line:93%
This is bad.
I am not even halfway done.

00:57:02.474 --> 00:57:04.974 line:93%
(He solves 4 questions
in 25 minutes.)

00:57:05.644 --> 00:57:07.414 line:93%
I can't do this.

00:57:08.615 --> 00:57:10.085 line:93%
My goodness.

00:57:10.085 --> 00:57:12.014 line:93%
(Life is a series of tests.)

00:57:12.155 --> 00:57:14.624 line:93%
- Time's up.
- My goodness.

00:57:14.624 --> 00:57:16.824 line:93%
Please put down the pen.

00:57:16.824 --> 00:57:18.624 line:93%
We will collect the answer sheets.

00:57:19.624 --> 00:57:21.764 line:93%
- This is...
- I wasn't anywhere near done.

00:57:22.465 --> 00:57:23.865 line:93%
(They have a mental breakdown
from taking a test.)

00:57:23.865 --> 00:57:25.264 line:93%
I can't believe it.

00:57:25.764 --> 00:57:28.365 line:93%
- It's one crisis after another.
- Seriously.

00:57:28.865 --> 00:57:30.204 line:93%
- You know,
- I will fail.

00:57:30.235 --> 00:57:32.574 line:93%
frustrating questions...

00:57:32.574 --> 00:57:34.945 line:93%
and unexpected situations...

00:57:34.945 --> 00:57:36.374 line:93%
- tortured us all day.
- I am in tatters.

00:57:36.374 --> 00:57:38.844 line:93%
Then we suffered a big blow here.

00:57:38.844 --> 00:57:41.414 line:93%
(The result of the basic
capability assessment)

00:57:41.414 --> 00:57:44.615 line:93%
(Jae Seok places first,
and Haha places last.)

00:57:44.615 --> 00:57:48.155 line:93%
We will now move on
to the interview.

00:57:48.284 --> 00:57:50.355 line:93%
In group 1, number 1 is Yu Jae Seok,

00:57:50.594 --> 00:57:52.195 line:93%
number two is Cho Sae Ho,

00:57:52.454 --> 00:57:54.264 line:93%
and number three is Yang Se Hyeong.

00:57:54.295 --> 00:57:56.695 line:93%
- Good luck.
- It's better to suffer first.

00:57:57.394 --> 00:57:59.635 line:93%
- Good luck.
- We will be back.

00:58:00.605 --> 00:58:04.675 line:93%
(They thought the interview room
would smell like sweet snacks.)

00:58:05.505 --> 00:58:10.074 line:93%
(The interviewers await the members
in a frigid atmosphere.)

00:58:11.574 --> 00:58:13.144 line:93%
It's this way.

00:58:15.244 --> 00:58:18.715 line:93%
(This isn't what they experienced
at the previous companies.)

00:58:19.054 --> 00:58:20.485 line:93%
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:58:20.485 --> 00:58:22.255 line:93%
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

00:58:22.255 --> 00:58:23.624 line:93%
- Please take a seat.
- Yes.

00:58:24.894 --> 00:58:26.925 line:93%
Thank you for applying
to our company.

00:58:26.965 --> 00:58:29.835 line:93%
In this interview,
we will hire the marketers...

00:58:29.835 --> 00:58:31.465 line:93%
who will lead
the confectionery industry.

00:58:31.465 --> 00:58:33.164 line:93%
- Please do your best.
- Yes.

00:58:36.534 --> 00:58:37.835 line:93%
(Park Hui Heon, Kim Hyung Geun,
Lee Ju Yeon, Kim Jun Beom)

00:58:38.204 --> 00:58:40.574 line:93%
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Cho Sae Ho.

00:58:40.804 --> 00:58:43.344 line:93%
At university, I majored
in Comedy and Theater.

00:58:43.744 --> 00:58:46.315 line:93%
I have a nickname.

00:58:46.684 --> 00:58:49.585 line:93%
It's Professional Traveler.

00:58:50.684 --> 00:58:52.925 line:93%
(His unchanging self-introduction
made Jae Seok burst out laughing.)

00:58:52.925 --> 00:58:54.885 line:93%
- You shouldn't laugh.
- You said it so many times.

00:58:56.054 --> 00:58:58.394 line:93%
(What do you think you are doing?)

00:58:58.394 --> 00:59:00.025 line:93%
- I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

00:59:00.025 --> 00:59:01.624 line:93%
- Keep going.
- I have a nickname.

00:59:01.624 --> 00:59:02.735 line:93%
It's Professional...

00:59:03.264 --> 00:59:04.465 line:93%
(His nostrils flare.)

00:59:05.034 --> 00:59:06.905 line:93%
(He couldn't help himself.)

00:59:10.304 --> 00:59:11.574 line:93%
I am sorry.

00:59:11.574 --> 00:59:14.505 line:93%
- We will give you time.
- My name is Cho Sae Ho.

00:59:14.574 --> 00:59:17.014 line:93%
At university, I majored
in Comedy and Theater.

00:59:17.215 --> 00:59:20.244 line:93%
I have a nickname.
It's Professional Traveler.

00:59:20.244 --> 00:59:21.914 line:93%
If someone calls for me,

00:59:21.914 --> 00:59:23.885 line:93%
I will carry my backpack...

00:59:23.885 --> 00:59:25.885 line:93%
and work hard where I am needed.

00:59:26.085 --> 00:59:27.224 line:93%
That's why I am
Professional Traveler.

00:59:27.224 --> 00:59:30.525 line:93%
Professional Traveler arrived
at this company now.

00:59:30.525 --> 00:59:32.295 line:93%
I wish to lay down my backpack...

00:59:32.295 --> 00:59:34.824 line:93%
and show my capabilities...

00:59:34.824 --> 00:59:36.635 line:93%
for the company.

00:59:36.635 --> 00:59:38.264 line:93%
You must have had
a lot of job interviews.

00:59:38.264 --> 00:59:41.005 line:93%
- That's not true.
- Do you say this at every company?

00:59:41.065 --> 00:59:42.204 line:93%
(He's keen.)

00:59:45.105 --> 00:59:46.704 line:93%
- Well...
- You do, don't you?

00:59:46.704 --> 00:59:49.005 line:93%
- I mean...
- You have, right?

00:59:49.005 --> 00:59:50.775 line:93%
- I don't remember.
- Really?

00:59:51.014 --> 00:59:53.344 line:93%
You talked about showing
your capabilities.

00:59:53.545 --> 00:59:56.115 line:93%
If you join the company,

00:59:56.255 --> 00:59:57.954 line:93%
exactly what capabilities
will you show?

00:59:57.954 --> 00:59:59.624 line:93%
In regard to my capabilities,

00:59:59.624 --> 01:00:02.755 line:93%
I can provide
good marketing ideas...

01:00:02.795 --> 01:00:04.824 line:93%
to show a marketer's capability.

01:00:04.824 --> 01:00:07.025 line:93%
There is a movie titled,
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory".

01:00:07.124 --> 01:00:09.994 line:93%
It's based on a book.
When you open a snack,

01:00:10.094 --> 01:00:13.204 line:93%
it would be great to find a card...

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:16.235 line:93%
that is dedicated to you.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:19.474 line:93%
I can show my capability...

01:00:19.474 --> 01:00:20.905 line:93%
- in this way.
- You can stop there.

01:00:20.905 --> 01:00:23.715 line:93%
- Okay.
- If your answer is too long...

01:00:23.945 --> 01:00:26.284 line:93%
- What?
- If your answer is too long...

01:00:26.284 --> 01:00:28.644 line:93%
- The others need fair treatment.
- Okay.

01:00:31.284 --> 01:00:32.724 line:93%
I want to go home.

01:00:34.054 --> 01:00:36.255 line:93%
Which company do you want to join?

01:00:36.494 --> 01:00:37.795 line:93%
- Company?
- Yes.

01:00:39.724 --> 01:00:41.624 line:93%
It's not like I can join
if I want to.

01:00:41.695 --> 01:00:43.394 line:93%
Tell me your wish.

01:00:43.494 --> 01:00:44.994 line:93%
I want to join this company.

01:00:45.695 --> 01:00:47.505 line:93%
I think I'll be able to eat as many
snacks as I want if I work here.

01:00:49.905 --> 01:00:51.374 line:93%
This is...

01:00:51.434 --> 01:00:53.704 line:93%
It's hard to make a living.

01:00:53.704 --> 01:00:54.905 line:93%
(They began to look for jobs
late in life.)

01:00:55.344 --> 01:00:56.874 line:93%
- Yang Se Hyeong.
- Yes.

01:00:57.014 --> 01:00:59.644 line:93%
On my lonely way home...

01:00:59.885 --> 01:01:02.045 line:93%
after school,

01:01:02.144 --> 01:01:05.755 line:93%
I ate Matdongsan
and imagine a dreamland.

01:01:06.085 --> 01:01:08.255 line:93%
Imagining a dreamland...

01:01:08.255 --> 01:01:10.954 line:93%
often gave me joy and happiness.

01:01:11.255 --> 01:01:14.295 line:93%
I came to pay the company back
for its kindness.

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:18.094 line:93%
I hope you would give me
a chance to do that.

01:01:18.934 --> 01:01:20.804 line:93%
- Yang Se Hyeong,
- Yes.

01:01:20.804 --> 01:01:22.974 line:93%
when you worked part-time
a gas station,

01:01:23.335 --> 01:01:26.545 line:93%
you bumped up the sales
of a fuel additive...

01:01:26.545 --> 01:01:29.775 line:93%
from 5 to 50.
You wrote it in your resume.

01:01:29.775 --> 01:01:31.545 line:93%
How did you achieve that?

01:01:31.545 --> 01:01:34.815 line:93%
It was a gas station
that was run by my uncle.

01:01:34.914 --> 01:01:37.684 line:93%
My brother and I worked
part-time there.

01:01:37.684 --> 01:01:40.824 line:93%
My uncle told us that...
Normally it's a dollar for each...

01:01:40.824 --> 01:01:42.795 line:93%
- fuel additive.
- That's the margin.

01:01:42.795 --> 01:01:45.124 line:93%
- He offered to give you 50 cents.
- He offered to give me 50 cents.

01:01:45.124 --> 01:01:48.224 line:93%
What I want to know is how
you sold 10 times the usual amount.

01:01:49.434 --> 01:01:51.965 line:93%
(Figure out
the purpose of the question.)

01:01:51.965 --> 01:01:54.735 line:93%
Firstly, I studied the function...

01:01:54.735 --> 01:01:56.675 line:93%
of the fuel additive perfectly.

01:01:56.704 --> 01:02:00.374 line:93%
Then I approached the customers
with small talk, jokes,

01:02:00.374 --> 01:02:02.675 line:93%
and cute acts
a high school student can show.

01:02:02.744 --> 01:02:05.445 line:93%
That was the tactic I used.

01:02:05.885 --> 01:02:07.284 line:93%
Understood.

01:02:08.014 --> 01:02:13.784 line:93%
(You can get a point deducted
if you stray from the point.)

01:02:14.324 --> 01:02:18.025 line:93%
As I wrote in my resume,

01:02:18.195 --> 01:02:20.465 line:93%
I have eaten snacks...

01:02:20.994 --> 01:02:23.164 line:93%
for 40 years.

01:02:23.394 --> 01:02:26.505 line:93%
I always wondered how it would be
to make snacks for a living.

01:02:26.605 --> 01:02:29.804 line:93%
I wish to use my capabilities
in this company.

01:02:30.034 --> 01:02:32.874 line:93%
You said that you have liked
snacks for 40 years.

01:02:33.144 --> 01:02:36.474 line:93%
You listed Homerun Ball,
a snack made from our company,

01:02:36.615 --> 01:02:39.144 line:93%
- as your favorite snack.
- Yes.

01:02:39.144 --> 01:02:43.184 line:93%
In that case,
what's your second favorite snack?

01:02:43.284 --> 01:02:44.815 line:93%
I like Jagalchi.

01:02:45.155 --> 01:02:47.284 line:93%
Do you know which company
it is from?

01:02:47.485 --> 01:02:49.255 line:93%
It's Nongshim.

01:02:50.425 --> 01:02:52.124 line:93%
- It's a good company.
- Yes.

01:02:53.425 --> 01:02:54.664 line:93%
All right.

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:57.534 line:93%
I personally like
such honest answer.

01:02:57.534 --> 01:03:01.434 line:93%
If an applicant says
that he or she can do anything...

01:03:01.465 --> 01:03:04.374 line:93%
the company asks,

01:03:04.374 --> 01:03:06.804 line:93%
the words lack sincerity.

01:03:06.804 --> 01:03:09.105 line:93%
What's more important is
being on your feet,

01:03:09.144 --> 01:03:11.215 line:93%
catching on quickly,
and being original.

01:03:11.215 --> 01:03:12.684 line:93%
It's Nongshim.

01:03:12.684 --> 01:03:16.184 line:93%
(Jae Seok didn't give the reasons
for his answer.)

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:21.385 line:93%
We asked enough questions
on the resume.

01:03:21.684 --> 01:03:24.824 line:93%
Now, the three of you will be given
the same question.

01:03:25.054 --> 01:03:28.494 line:93%
Have you recently purchased
a product from our company?

01:03:28.494 --> 01:03:30.965 line:93%
- Yu Jae Seok.
- I bought Homerun Ball...

01:03:31.465 --> 01:03:33.335 line:93%
made with low-fat milk.

01:03:33.335 --> 01:03:34.965 line:93%
I enjoyed it a lot.

01:03:34.965 --> 01:03:38.474 line:93%
Which aspects did you like...

01:03:38.474 --> 01:03:41.105 line:93%
and dislike?

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:44.574 line:93%
I have eaten Homerun Ball...

01:03:44.775 --> 01:03:46.344 line:93%
ever since it came out.

01:03:46.784 --> 01:03:50.684 line:93%
I think the number of balls
in a bag decreased.

01:03:50.684 --> 01:03:52.284 line:93%
I have been curious about it.

01:03:52.284 --> 01:03:54.155 line:93%
I should have counted them
when I was little.

01:03:55.184 --> 01:03:56.624 line:93%
How about you, Cho Sae Ho?

01:03:56.624 --> 01:04:00.465 line:93%
The ice cream I liked
ever since I was little is...

01:04:01.065 --> 01:04:02.664 line:93%
Bravo.

01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.494 line:93%
I love that ice cream.

01:04:04.494 --> 01:04:08.434 line:93%
I still remember a commercial
from 30 years ago.

01:04:08.465 --> 01:04:11.704 line:93%
The best singers of Korea
came together...

01:04:12.034 --> 01:04:14.905 line:93%
and sang a song in the commercial.

01:04:14.905 --> 01:04:17.545 line:93%
- It was before I joined.
- That's right.

01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:23.715 line:93%
(Yoon Bok Hee, Jung Su Ra,
Lee Sang Eun, Chung Hoon Hee, etc.)

01:04:23.715 --> 01:04:27.684 line:93%
(The best musicians of the era
made the commercial song.)

01:04:28.224 --> 01:04:30.394 line:93%
It was very impactful.

01:04:30.394 --> 01:04:33.264 line:93%
To this day, I enjoy the product...

01:04:33.264 --> 01:04:36.034 line:93%
with my friends
when I crave ice cream.

01:04:36.034 --> 01:04:37.894 line:93%
Do you have any dissatisfaction
about the product?

01:04:39.465 --> 01:04:42.204 line:93%
I can eat two,

01:04:42.534 --> 01:04:43.905 line:93%
so I am not dissatisfied.

01:04:43.905 --> 01:04:48.005 line:93%
Our company has
famous commercial songs.

01:04:48.074 --> 01:04:50.014 line:93%
- That's right.
- Do you know any one of them?

01:04:50.244 --> 01:04:51.744 line:93%
Happy Bravo

01:04:51.744 --> 01:04:54.744 line:93%
- That's it.
- Happy Bravo

01:04:56.014 --> 01:04:58.385 line:93%
- Stat from the beginning.
- Take your time.

01:04:59.684 --> 01:05:01.724 line:93%
- Shall I give you the beginning?
- Yes.

01:05:01.925 --> 01:05:04.054 line:93%
The song starts with "12pm".

01:05:05.195 --> 01:05:06.994 line:93%
(12pm is the time we meet)

01:05:07.594 --> 01:05:09.994 line:93%
Happy Bravo Cone

01:05:10.394 --> 01:05:11.735 line:93%
(He is embarrassed.)

01:05:11.735 --> 01:05:14.505 line:93%
- That's enough.
- The key and beat were off.

01:05:14.505 --> 01:05:17.135 line:93%
I was too nervous. I will learn it
once I join the company.

01:05:17.934 --> 01:05:19.474 line:93%
Let's move on to the next question.

01:05:19.474 --> 01:05:21.045 line:93%
(He managed to make people laugh.)

01:05:22.074 --> 01:05:24.414 line:93%
Myeong Soo.

01:05:25.615 --> 01:05:26.815 line:93%
It must be free.

01:05:26.815 --> 01:05:27.815 line:93%
(There are lots of snacks.)

01:05:29.315 --> 01:05:30.985 line:93%
There's food in the back.

01:05:33.025 --> 01:05:34.655 line:93%
There are drinks too.

01:05:35.124 --> 01:05:36.224 line:93%
There are drinks.

01:05:37.025 --> 01:05:38.624 line:93%
(Crunching)

01:05:38.624 --> 01:05:40.664 line:93%
(Munching)

01:05:40.664 --> 01:05:41.664 line:93%
This is great.

01:05:42.365 --> 01:05:44.764 line:93%
(They have a tasting.)

01:05:45.494 --> 01:05:47.235 line:93%
Here's the next question.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.235 line:93%
Soon the elderly population
will dominate.

01:05:50.235 --> 01:05:52.335 line:93%
When the population becomes
predominantly elderly,

01:05:52.405 --> 01:05:54.874 line:93%
what type of new product...

01:05:54.874 --> 01:05:57.414 line:93%
is necessary to sell to the elderly?

01:05:57.414 --> 01:06:00.385 line:93%
Sometimes my friends and I
want to make...

01:06:00.914 --> 01:06:04.485 line:93%
or purchase a cake,
but it can be costly.

01:06:04.784 --> 01:06:07.724 line:93%
Once I made a cake with...

01:06:07.925 --> 01:06:09.954 line:93%
brownies called Yes.

01:06:10.094 --> 01:06:11.454 line:93%
Here's a thought I had.

01:06:11.454 --> 01:06:14.295 line:93%
What if we make
a large version of it...

01:06:14.295 --> 01:06:16.065 line:93%
that is as big as a cake?

01:06:16.094 --> 01:06:17.994 line:93%
If it's made large,

01:06:18.034 --> 01:06:22.905 line:93%
children can give it to
their grandparents as a present.

01:06:22.905 --> 01:06:24.775 line:93%
I thought it'd be a good idea.

01:06:24.905 --> 01:06:28.505 line:93%
Next question is related to
naming products.

01:06:28.905 --> 01:06:32.585 line:93%
Our company is planning to
make dumplings with...

01:06:32.615 --> 01:06:34.514 line:93%
spicy octopus.

01:06:34.815 --> 01:06:39.525 line:93%
How would you name these dumplings?

01:06:39.525 --> 01:06:42.894 line:93%
Naming a product can be
the most important factor.

01:06:42.894 --> 01:06:45.925 line:93%
- Explain your idea behind the name.
- There's no pressure.

01:06:45.925 --> 01:06:46.994 line:93%
I think...

01:06:46.994 --> 01:06:49.534 line:93%
- Please start.
- From couples' point of view,

01:06:49.835 --> 01:06:51.664 line:93%
I'd name it Angry Octopus.

01:06:52.094 --> 01:06:53.164 line:93%
- "Angry Octopus"?
- Angry Octopus.

01:06:53.204 --> 01:06:54.534 line:93%
- "Angry Octopus"?
- A woman sends a message.

01:06:54.534 --> 01:06:55.764 line:93%
"Honey, I'm angry today."

01:06:56.374 --> 01:06:57.374 line:93%
"Why are you angry?"

01:06:57.374 --> 01:06:58.374 line:93%
(He imagines a commercial.)

01:06:58.374 --> 01:07:01.344 line:93%
She's angry because
she craves Angry Octopus.

01:07:01.644 --> 01:07:02.844 line:93%
That's one idea.

01:07:02.974 --> 01:07:07.815 line:93%
If we shoot a commercial with TWICE,

01:07:08.144 --> 01:07:09.715 line:93%
they have a song
called "Knock Knock".

01:07:10.954 --> 01:07:12.514 line:93%
(It rings at 12 o'clock)

01:07:12.755 --> 01:07:14.885 line:93%
Knock, knock, knock, knock

01:07:15.324 --> 01:07:17.394 line:93%
It's made with octopus, Knock Knock.

01:07:18.094 --> 01:07:19.155 line:93%
(It's made with octopus.)

01:07:19.155 --> 01:07:20.164 line:93%
(Even TWICE likes it.)

01:07:20.164 --> 01:07:22.264 line:93%
(It's the new Angry Octopus.)

01:07:22.835 --> 01:07:24.335 line:93%
(His voice is husky.)

01:07:24.965 --> 01:07:27.005 line:93%
That's another idea.

01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:29.974 line:93%
- Angry indicates fire, right?
- Right.

01:07:29.974 --> 01:07:32.005 line:93%
Knock Knock doesn't include
the spicy flavor.

01:07:32.175 --> 01:07:34.804 line:93%
It's missing the key concept.

01:07:34.804 --> 01:07:39.385 line:93%
We can name it
Angry Octopus or Spicy Octopus.

01:07:39.385 --> 01:07:42.385 line:93%
It's either Angry or Spicy Octopus.

01:07:42.385 --> 01:07:45.315 line:93%
Spicy Octopus indicates
the spicy flavor.

01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:46.485 line:93%
- Spicy flavor?
- Yes.

01:07:47.025 --> 01:07:48.624 line:93%
(Knock Knock)

01:07:48.624 --> 01:07:49.655 line:93%
(Spicy Octopus)

01:07:49.925 --> 01:07:53.525 line:93%
Dumplings are made with
spicy octopus.

01:07:53.525 --> 01:07:56.394 line:93%
It'd be a good idea to shorten...

01:07:56.394 --> 01:07:58.835 line:93%
a long name.

01:07:59.505 --> 01:08:03.704 line:93%
From Spicy Dumplings
Made with Red Octopus,

01:08:04.175 --> 01:08:05.704 line:93%
we call it Red Dumplings.

01:08:06.605 --> 01:08:08.074 line:93%
Pronunciation is important.

01:08:08.175 --> 01:08:10.874 line:93%
If it's advertised well,

01:08:10.874 --> 01:08:15.414 line:93%
the name will become popular
among the young crowd.

01:08:15.414 --> 01:08:16.414 line:93%
That's my idea.

01:08:16.414 --> 01:08:18.155 line:93%
Will it be okay
for the company's reputation?

01:08:18.454 --> 01:08:20.284 line:93%
How about Reddish Dumplings?

01:08:20.284 --> 01:08:22.455 line:93%
- That's even worse.
- What?

01:08:22.924 --> 01:08:25.394 line:93%
(It's a flavor that
you want to steal.)

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:28.625 line:93%
(High quality dumplings
are safe to eat.)

01:08:28.825 --> 01:08:31.834 line:93%
Okay, your idea wasn't bad.

01:08:31.834 --> 01:08:34.334 line:93%
Naming a product in short time
is difficult.

01:08:34.334 --> 01:08:36.634 line:93%
We asked to test
your ability to think quickly.

01:08:36.634 --> 01:08:39.304 line:93%
What do you think marketing is?

01:08:39.304 --> 01:08:40.344 line:93%
I think...

01:08:41.644 --> 01:08:46.344 line:93%
marketing is about selling products.

01:08:46.684 --> 01:08:48.615 line:93%
- Not at all.
- How about you, Sae Ho?

01:08:49.714 --> 01:08:54.184 line:93%
It's about the reception of
the consumers that is as natural...

01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:55.724 line:93%
as possible.

01:08:55.825 --> 01:08:58.294 line:93%
It's done through marketing.

01:08:58.294 --> 01:09:01.094 line:93%
The father of marketing...

01:09:01.094 --> 01:09:02.424 line:93%
(He seems unsure.)

01:09:02.794 --> 01:09:03.934 line:93%
- Philip...
- Philip Kotler?

01:09:03.934 --> 01:09:06.105 line:93%
Kotler wrote a book.

01:09:07.634 --> 01:09:10.875 line:93%
(He can't remember what he studied.)

01:09:11.134 --> 01:09:12.405 line:93%
K-O-T-L-E-R.

01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:14.775 line:93%
(Nose hair?)

01:09:16.714 --> 01:09:19.174 line:93%
While making profits,

01:09:19.415 --> 01:09:21.415 line:93%
you must satisfy customers' needs.

01:09:21.415 --> 01:09:22.514 line:93%
That sounds wrong.

01:09:22.514 --> 01:09:26.325 line:93%
We asked about
the basic of marketing.

01:09:26.325 --> 01:09:28.155 line:93%
(No one answered correctly.)

01:09:28.155 --> 01:09:32.155 line:93%
We've been talking for
about 20 to 30 minutes.

01:09:32.195 --> 01:09:35.264 line:93%
Explain how you feel now
in five words.

01:09:36.235 --> 01:09:37.235 line:93%
I will try next time.

01:09:38.934 --> 01:09:40.065 line:93%
Did you already...

01:09:40.065 --> 01:09:42.004 line:93%
- lose confidence?
- Are you giving up?

01:09:42.334 --> 01:09:45.474 line:93%
I can tell by the look in the eyes.

01:09:46.105 --> 01:09:47.105 line:93%
Your eyes tell me.

01:09:47.205 --> 01:09:51.514 line:93%
Mr. Kim Hyung Geun
doesn't seem to like me.

01:09:51.514 --> 01:09:54.745 line:93%
I don't usually express my feelings.

01:09:54.915 --> 01:09:56.084 line:93%
- Is that so?
- Okay.

01:09:56.084 --> 01:09:57.115 line:93%
How about you, Sae Ho?

01:09:57.115 --> 01:10:00.754 line:93%
My answer in five words is
I will not go home.

01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:02.384 line:93%
That's my answer.

01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:03.894 line:93%
What do you want to do instead?

01:10:03.894 --> 01:10:07.794 line:93%
I want to share
snacks and ice cream...

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.934 line:93%
with my friends.

01:10:09.934 --> 01:10:11.264 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:10:11.264 --> 01:10:12.294 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:10:14.134 --> 01:10:15.605 line:93%
- It's been an hour.
- Isn't that too long?

01:10:15.605 --> 01:10:17.174 line:93%
- It's been an hour.
- How's it possible?

01:10:17.174 --> 01:10:18.375 line:93%
- It was tough.
- Time flew by.

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:20.004 line:93%
- It was tough.
- Why?

01:10:20.004 --> 01:10:21.504 line:93%
- Was it difficult?
- I'm still scared.

01:10:21.504 --> 01:10:23.315 line:93%
- Did you feel that?
- What's wrong?

01:10:23.315 --> 01:10:25.275 line:93%
The last two companies...

01:10:25.815 --> 01:10:27.514 line:93%
- were more casual.
- Right.

01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:29.315 line:93%
This is the interview
that we expected.

01:10:29.315 --> 01:10:30.615 line:93%
It's the hardest level.

01:10:30.615 --> 01:10:31.815 line:93%
Was it different
from the delivery service?

01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:34.025 line:93%
The one who was sitting
at the end...

01:10:34.025 --> 01:10:35.855 line:93%
seemed like a detective.

01:10:36.794 --> 01:10:39.525 line:93%
(What kind of manager is he?)

01:10:39.525 --> 01:10:42.735 line:93%
(He looks and speaks
like an interrogator.)

01:10:43.565 --> 01:10:46.134 line:93%
This is the only hope that we have.

01:10:46.134 --> 01:10:49.634 line:93%
Generally speaking, they don't have
basic knowledge of marketing.

01:10:49.634 --> 01:10:51.605 line:93%
- Right.
- Cho Sae Ho...

01:10:51.605 --> 01:10:54.575 line:93%
would be better in sales
than marketing.

01:10:54.644 --> 01:10:57.415 line:93%
- He fits with marketing these days.
- Really?

01:10:57.415 --> 01:10:59.214 line:93%
His idea was Angry Octopus.

01:10:59.245 --> 01:11:00.644 line:93%
I thought it was a good idea.

01:11:00.644 --> 01:11:03.384 line:93%
- Angry Octopus Spicy Octopus?
- I liked his idea.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.884 line:93%
- I've never seen you like this.
- I felt that...

01:11:06.254 --> 01:11:08.825 line:93%
you completely lost your energy.

01:11:08.825 --> 01:11:10.794 line:93%
We had three interviews today.

01:11:11.094 --> 01:11:14.565 line:93%
During the first interview, I still
had my entertaining personality.

01:11:14.894 --> 01:11:17.065 line:93%
During this interview, I felt like
it was my last chance,

01:11:17.065 --> 01:11:19.804 line:93%
and that I'd be in trouble
if I didn't make it.

01:11:19.804 --> 01:11:21.605 line:93%
So I felt pressured,
and my mind went blank.

01:11:22.705 --> 01:11:26.875 line:93%
What kind of product would be
appropriate to sell to...

01:11:26.875 --> 01:11:28.544 line:93%
the elderly population?

01:11:28.544 --> 01:11:30.344 line:93%
How about injeolmi snacks?

01:11:30.344 --> 01:11:33.785 line:93%
I hope for more snacks
with rice cake flavors.

01:11:33.785 --> 01:11:36.014 line:93%
We can make the snacks softer.

01:11:36.014 --> 01:11:39.424 line:93%
We can make
the existing snacks softer.

01:11:39.424 --> 01:11:41.084 line:93%
I think it'd be a good idea.

01:11:41.084 --> 01:11:42.554 line:93%
Please express the flavor.

01:11:42.554 --> 01:11:45.394 line:93%
It may be physical or literal.

01:11:45.825 --> 01:11:49.334 line:93%
My son, catch it.
It's my love for you.

01:11:49.334 --> 01:11:51.495 line:93%
(He plays baseball with his son.)

01:11:52.035 --> 01:11:54.764 line:93%
Here it comes.

01:11:56.205 --> 01:11:57.405 line:93%
Catch it.

01:11:57.405 --> 01:11:59.775 line:93%
(That was me a minute ago.)

01:12:00.474 --> 01:12:03.075 line:93%
I love you, Dad.

01:12:03.075 --> 01:12:04.115 line:93%
It's Dad's flavor.

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:06.384 line:93%
It's a home run.

01:12:06.384 --> 01:12:07.384 line:93%
(Laughing)

01:12:08.714 --> 01:12:11.455 line:93%
We're proficient in speaking
about things that we know well.

01:12:11.455 --> 01:12:14.625 line:93%
As Jun Ha eats a lot,

01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:17.424 line:93%
and he has seen and done
marketing before,

01:12:17.554 --> 01:12:19.125 line:93%
he has expertise.

01:12:19.394 --> 01:12:23.195 line:93%
He showed interest in
the organization of marketing.

01:12:23.195 --> 01:12:27.905 line:93%
His detailed answers showed that
he spent time thinking about it.

01:12:27.905 --> 01:12:29.434 line:93%
I hope you'll consider me.

01:12:29.434 --> 01:12:30.705 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:12:30.705 --> 01:12:32.745 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the snacks.

01:12:32.875 --> 01:12:34.644 line:93%
- Neoguri...
- Fried snacks.

01:12:35.075 --> 01:12:36.974 line:93%
- I consider Cho Sae Ho...
- Cho Sae Ho...

01:12:36.974 --> 01:12:39.544 line:93%
Cho Sae Ho was the best.

01:12:39.544 --> 01:12:43.384 line:93%
He was more earnest
than the other candidates.

01:12:43.455 --> 01:12:45.855 line:93%
Compared to actual candidates...

01:12:45.924 --> 01:12:48.485 line:93%
whom we interview in real life,

01:12:48.785 --> 01:12:49.955 line:93%
he was more passionate.

01:12:49.995 --> 01:12:53.794 line:93%
There are no candidates who
can't stay still in their seat...

01:12:53.794 --> 01:12:55.224 line:93%
because they're anxious
to speak first.

01:12:55.224 --> 01:12:59.205 line:93%
However, that's one
of the most important...

01:12:59.504 --> 01:13:01.535 line:93%
factors that we consider
during interviews.

01:13:01.905 --> 01:13:04.504 line:93%
(Youth unemployment rate
is 9.8 percent.)

01:13:05.304 --> 01:13:07.375 line:93%
(Employment is at its worst
since the IMF crisis.)

01:13:08.144 --> 01:13:12.014 line:93%
(Exhausted job seekers get busy.)

01:13:12.714 --> 01:13:15.514 line:93%
Even if you lack
some background knowledge,

01:13:15.514 --> 01:13:19.525 line:93%
as long as you show
earnestness and determination,

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:22.355 line:93%
we could give you a chance.

01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:25.394 line:93%
We can give them basic knowledge.

01:13:25.525 --> 01:13:28.625 line:93%
People think that game companies
are free and casual.

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:30.735 line:93%
Our company is free in some ways,

01:13:30.735 --> 01:13:34.764 line:93%
but making games is
all about teamwork.

01:13:34.764 --> 01:13:38.205 line:93%
It's about conversation
and trust among people.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:40.275 line:93%
These are important factors.

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:44.514 line:93%
Candidates try to hide their
weaknesses during the interview...

01:13:44.514 --> 01:13:45.514 line:93%
to look good.

01:13:45.514 --> 01:13:49.014 line:93%
It's better to reveal your weakness
with confidence...

01:13:49.014 --> 01:13:52.924 line:93%
and show how you can overcome it.

01:13:52.924 --> 01:13:54.924 line:93%
That's what's considered appealing.

01:13:54.924 --> 01:13:56.455 line:93%
You shouldn't be passive.

01:13:56.455 --> 01:13:58.924 line:93%
It's better to have
a sense of confidence.

01:13:58.924 --> 01:14:02.264 line:93%
Speak comfortably,
and be completely honest.

01:14:02.264 --> 01:14:05.834 line:93%
Unlike what's on your resume,
show who you really are.

01:14:07.705 --> 01:14:10.075 line:93%
(Ace the Interview)

01:14:10.804 --> 01:14:12.275 line:93%
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you.

01:14:12.275 --> 01:14:14.875 line:93%
- Good job.
- Today was difficult.

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:17.474 line:93%
I haven't had a headache
in a long time.

01:14:17.615 --> 01:14:20.544 line:93%
Today was a very rough day.

01:14:20.544 --> 01:14:21.615 line:93%
It definitely was.

01:14:21.615 --> 01:14:25.884 line:93%
I realized that the world
is full of difficulties...

01:14:25.884 --> 01:14:27.525 line:93%
- and lawless.
- "Lawless"?

01:14:27.724 --> 01:14:29.825 line:93%
- What do you mean?
- Just ignore it today.

01:14:29.825 --> 01:14:32.125 line:93%
- I'm really exhausted.
- Ignore it.

01:14:32.224 --> 01:14:34.424 line:93%
- I understand.
- I understand what you mean.

01:14:34.424 --> 01:14:36.964 line:93%
Leave Se Hyeong alone
until the end of next week.

01:14:37.235 --> 01:14:39.405 line:93%
- I saw him during the interviews.
- It was a chance...

01:14:39.405 --> 01:14:41.134 line:93%
to realize how tough it is.

01:14:41.134 --> 01:14:43.705 line:93%
We hope that this year,
those looking for jobs...

01:14:43.705 --> 01:14:46.405 line:93%
will be hired by companies
where they want to work.

01:14:46.605 --> 01:14:49.714 line:93%
I hope that they can all work
and be happy.

01:14:49.714 --> 01:14:52.985 line:93%
It's our sincere wish.

01:14:52.985 --> 01:14:56.514 line:93%
The year 2018 is
the Year of the Golden Dog.

01:14:56.514 --> 01:14:58.285 line:93%
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

01:14:58.915 --> 01:15:00.554 line:93%
- Gosh.
- The floor is so cold.

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:02.384 line:93%
- You're right.
- Goodness.

01:15:02.794 --> 01:15:06.125 line:93%
(It's Jack Frost
for weather forecast.)

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:08.094 line:93%
(Where are you coming from?)

01:15:08.794 --> 01:15:10.394 line:93%
(He asks people for interviews.)

01:15:10.834 --> 01:15:13.365 line:93%
May I interview you? It'll be short.

01:15:14.334 --> 01:15:16.535 line:93%
(Jack Frost asks for interviews.)

01:15:16.535 --> 01:15:17.804 line:93%
(What's the story behind it?)

01:15:18.634 --> 01:15:19.644 line:93%
I hear you.

01:15:19.644 --> 01:15:23.174 line:93%
(Due to the cold weather,
they're filming from home.)

01:15:24.014 --> 01:15:26.884 line:93%
(Do they get to
stay at home and relax?)

01:15:27.615 --> 01:15:30.254 line:93%
(Is it okay just to eat?)

01:15:31.254 --> 01:15:32.785 line:93%
(That's what they thought.)

01:15:33.054 --> 01:15:34.985 line:93%
The theme of this episode is...

01:15:34.985 --> 01:15:36.094 line:93%
An Hour Before.

01:15:36.094 --> 01:15:37.195 line:93%
- An hour before?
- This is driving me nuts.

01:15:37.195 --> 01:15:38.625 line:93%
(An Hour Before Special?)

01:15:38.724 --> 01:15:40.525 line:93%
It could be any situation or place,

01:15:40.525 --> 01:15:42.834 line:93%
but you'll be placed there
an hour before it starts.

01:15:43.594 --> 01:15:45.165 line:93%
(You have no time to ask
what your job is.)

01:15:46.464 --> 01:15:48.535 line:93%
(That is why he's here
in the middle of the winter.)

01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:51.834 line:93%
(He becomes a flight attendant
2 hours before departure.)

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:56.344 line:93%
(He has no time to be nervous.)

01:15:57.815 --> 01:15:59.485 line:93%
(In the blink of an eye,
he's flying in the sky.)

01:16:00.644 --> 01:16:02.615 line:93%
(Haha is invited
to a birthday party,)

01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:05.054 line:93%
(while Jae Seok is on
a dizzy suspension bridge.)

01:16:05.514 --> 01:16:07.054 line:93%
(You have to adapt no matter what.)

01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:08.724 line:93%
(An Hour Before)
