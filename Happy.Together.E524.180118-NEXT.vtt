1
00:00:08.197 --> 00:00:09.498
It's always better when we're together,

2
00:00:09.498 --> 00:00:11.197
- Happy Together! - Happy Together!

3
00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:12.908
Hello.

4
00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:14.107
(They're happy to meet again.)

5
00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:15.168
It's been a while.

6
00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:17.338
Gosh. It's good to see you again.

7
00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:18.377
It's good to see you again.

8
00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:21.147
- Hyun Moo, you look great today. - My gosh.

9
00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:22.678
Congratulations.

10
00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:24.678
He gained a nickname, Grand Award Jun.

11
00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:25.877
- Hi, Grand Award Jun. - Right.

12
00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:28.147
The wrong name "Jun Hyun Moo" was written on the screen just now.

13
00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:30.888
- It's Grand Award Jun now. - I understand.

14
00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:35.557
When I announced the winner on the stage,

15
00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:37.158
- I saw his eyes. - That's right.

16
00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:39.057
- I saw the flaming desire in them. - He looked so scary.

17
00:00:39.057 --> 00:00:41.368
- Why? - I watched the ceremony on TV.

18
00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.038
He looked really scary.

19
00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:45.398
Hyun Moo's eyes...

20
00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:49.777
looked like Myung Soo's right before Myung Soo received the grand award.

21
00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:52.338
When Hyun Moo was announced as the grand award winner,

22
00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:55.247
Myung Soo was the most surprised among everyone.

23
00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:56.677
I was sitting next to him that day.

24
00:00:56.677 --> 00:00:58.618
When he was announced as the top excellence award winner,

25
00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:01.688
I saw him sigh quietly. He seemed a bit disappointed.

26
00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:03.787
- Let's congratulate him again. - Okay.

27
00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:06.888
- Hyun Moo deserved the award, - Right.

28
00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:08.528
and it's good news for us.

29
00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:09.558
- That's right. - In fact,

30
00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:11.298
KBS Entertainment Awards wasn't held last year.

31
00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:13.268
- It will be held this year, right? - Yes.

32
00:01:13.268 --> 00:01:15.067
It's okay because Jae Seok will win the grand award again.

33
00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:17.168
Rather than winning the grand award,

34
00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:19.968
- I hope... - Jae Seok is meant to win it.

35
00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:23.007
that Happy Together will be more successful this year,

36
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:24.677
so we can win the variety show of the year.

37
00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:26.448
- I hope so too. - Right.

38
00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:30.117
I heard that Hyun Moo is seeking to win the grand award from KBS too.

39
00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:32.847
I'm seeking to win the grand award through Happy Together.

40
00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.147
- I hope you'll win it. - Winning it once made me greedy.

41
00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:37.858
- Is that so? - It's like the One Ring.

42
00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:40.058
There's something else we should celebrate.

43
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.727
Sae Ho recently joined a popular variety show.

44
00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:44.698
- Yes. Sae Ho... - "Infinite Challenge".

45
00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:46.498
That's right. Thank you.

46
00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:48.727
Sae Ho, Happy Together or "Infinite Challenge"?

47
00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:50.237
- 1, 2, 3. - 2, 3.

48
00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:53.908
(What could be the choice of the nomad entertainer?)

49
00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:56.207
To be honest, I would choose Happy Together.

50
00:01:56.207 --> 00:01:58.207
- It's because... - "To be honest"?

51
00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:00.078
Gosh.

52
00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:03.748
(It was too difficult for him to come up with a good answer.)

53
00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:04.847
What's wrong with my eyes?

54
00:02:04.948 --> 00:02:05.977
(The answer machine is malfunctioning.)

55
00:02:05.977 --> 00:02:07.188
- It's a difficult question. - However,

56
00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:10.487
he chose Happy Together, but our staff members don't seem happy.

57
00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:11.487
That's right.

58
00:02:11.487 --> 00:02:15.187
Also, Hyeon Gyeong is playing such a romantic character...

59
00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:18.527
- She's the queen of sitcom. - She's the queen.

60
00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:22.328
She's the only one who was locked up in prison during the break.

61
00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:23.867
(She went to prison in her sitcom.)

62
00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:25.337
- I mean... - I went to prison.

63
00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:27.508
- She was locked up. - Yes. I was locked up for a while.

64
00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:30.878
We'll continue doing our best to make Happy Together popular,

65
00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:33.707
- so we can get a good result... - Right.

66
00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:35.508
- at the end of 2018. - We should strive for it.

67
00:02:35.508 --> 00:02:38.217
- We'll do our best. - At the end of this year,

68
00:02:38.217 --> 00:02:40.548
I hope every one of us will sit at the Happy Together table...

69
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:42.318
- all together. - Everyone except for you came.

70
00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:44.388
- Is that so? - Just don't be late.

71
00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:46.117
I promise I'll be there.

72
00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:50.157
Today, we're going to meet very popular stars.

73
00:02:50.157 --> 00:02:51.798
Hyun Moo, please introduce our today's guests.

74
00:02:51.798 --> 00:02:54.598
I would fall into a fiery pit if I can be with them.

75
00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:55.897
- Is that so? - Yes.

76
00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:57.798
You must know the movie, "Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds"...

77
00:02:57.798 --> 00:02:59.168
that hit more than 10 million views.

78
00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:01.207
Today, we'll be with queens.

79
00:03:01.737 --> 00:03:04.707
- Queens. - It's grand award winners' joke.

80
00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:09.147
For a grand award winner, you made such a predictable joke.

81
00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.448
Right. I'm sorry.

82
00:03:10.448 --> 00:03:12.647
Now that you won the grand award, all that's left is going down.

83
00:03:12.647 --> 00:03:15.948
For a moment, I thought I can win the grand award too.

84
00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:17.487
There's a jinx on the grand award.

85
00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:18.788
You should be careful after winning the grand award.

86
00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:20.187
I lowered the standard.

87
00:03:20.187 --> 00:03:21.788
- Challenge me anytime. - All right.

88
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:24.828
We'll meet the queens now. Please come out.

89
00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:26.798
(The queens are entering.)

90
00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:29.538
- Hello. - Kim Se Jeong.

91
00:03:30.237 --> 00:03:31.798
- Hello. - Hello.

92
00:03:31.798 --> 00:03:32.798
Welcome.

93
00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:34.237
From the queen of musical plays...

94
00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:37.038
to the high ratings guaranteed of dramas.

95
00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:39.437
She's charismatic when she plays roles with a high-paying job,

96
00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:40.707
but she's clumsy in real life.

97
00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:42.707
The lovely queen with unexpected charms, Bae Hae Sun.

98
00:03:42.707 --> 00:03:44.378
(Bae Hae Sun, the queen with charming clumsiness)

99
00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:45.478
Hello.

100
00:03:45.848 --> 00:03:49.518
She has a perfect body with ideal body proportions.

101
00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:53.288
She became a star by losing weight. The weight loss queen.

102
00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:54.858
- Lee Soo Kyung! - Lee Soo Kyung.

103
00:03:54.858 --> 00:03:56.897
- Hello. - Lee Soo Kyung!

104
00:03:56.897 --> 00:03:58.157
Hello.

105
00:03:58.157 --> 00:04:01.598
She has an innocent face, but she's also many people's girl crush.

106
00:04:01.698 --> 00:04:05.397
She's energetic and passionate. 24 hours are not enough for her.

107
00:04:05.397 --> 00:04:08.108
The queen of passion, Han Bo Reum.

108
00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:09.777
Let's move on.

109
00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:12.508
She's good at singing, dancing, and acting.

110
00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:13.948
She's becoming more and more successful.

111
00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:15.207
The multi-talented queen, Kim Se Jeong.

112
00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.477
The multi-talented queen, Kim Se Jeong.

113
00:04:18.078 --> 00:04:22.287
Today, these four queens are here with us.

114
00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:25.688
This is Hae Sun's first appearance on Happy Together.

115
00:04:25.888 --> 00:04:29.157
People say that any drama she plays in becomes a big hit.

116
00:04:29.157 --> 00:04:32.597
She's such a great actress and scene stealer.

117
00:04:32.597 --> 00:04:33.768
A prosecutor in "While You Were Sleeping",

118
00:04:33.768 --> 00:04:35.568
a doctor in "Jealousy Incarnate",

119
00:04:35.597 --> 00:04:36.998
a nurse in "Yong Pal",

120
00:04:36.998 --> 00:04:38.897
an oriental doctor in "The Man Who Dies to Live", and...

121
00:04:38.897 --> 00:04:41.508
- And in "Judge vs. Judge"... - I played a judge.

122
00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:42.638
A judge in "Judge vs. Judge".

123
00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:44.938
I played roles in high positions, so someone mentioned the first lady.

124
00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:48.178
- That's the highest position. - That's right.

125
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:50.678
I played many characters with a specialized job.

126
00:04:50.678 --> 00:04:52.518
Of course I played many other roles as well.

127
00:04:52.888 --> 00:04:56.457
I think I got those roles because of my voice and the way of speaking.

128
00:04:56.457 --> 00:04:57.888
You look trustworthy.

129
00:04:57.888 --> 00:04:59.988
- I think that's why. - Some people say that...

130
00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:03.628
they spend most of their time on eating.

131
00:05:04.097 --> 00:05:05.457
She spends most of her time on finding things.

132
00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:06.467
Is that true?

133
00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:09.868
I happened to get many roles with a specialized job,

134
00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:12.537
- but I am actually quite clumsy. - Are you?

135
00:05:12.537 --> 00:05:15.868
Yes. So I wasn't sure whether I should come onto the show or not.

136
00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:17.678
- Why? - I was afraid...

137
00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:19.707
I might not get such parts anymore when people know my personality.

138
00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:21.748
I saw her while waiting at the back.

139
00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:23.678
She was like a little girl.

140
00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:27.047
She looked like she would laugh over little things like a teenage girl.

141
00:05:27.248 --> 00:05:28.688
- Really? - Yes.

142
00:05:29.217 --> 00:05:30.857
You are so beautiful.

143
00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:33.957
When can I see celebrities so close like this?

144
00:05:33.957 --> 00:05:35.058
(She's excited.)

145
00:05:36.087 --> 00:05:38.428
What is it? I'm serious. Why are you laughing?

146
00:05:38.428 --> 00:05:40.998
I am very nervous right now.

147
00:05:40.998 --> 00:05:45.337
But since you guys lead me well, I'm having fun and feel happy.

148
00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:48.037
- We just... - I guess you imagine things often.

149
00:05:48.508 --> 00:05:50.207
We would like you to share what you imagined,

150
00:05:50.207 --> 00:05:52.438
- She kept it to herself. - but you wouldn't tell us.

151
00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:55.678
Seeing the people I saw on TV so often this close...

152
00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:58.578
makes me feel like you all are especially close to me.

153
00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:00.587
Sae Ho always makes people feel that way.

154
00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:02.787
- You're the same. - Is that so?

155
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.157
Look at him.

156
00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:08.787
He must think he's changed because he won the grand award.

157
00:06:09.227 --> 00:06:10.428
You look the same.

158
00:06:11.157 --> 00:06:12.797
In the drama, "Yong Pal",

159
00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:15.597
you slapped Kim Tae Hee on her face.

160
00:06:15.698 --> 00:06:17.498
In that scene, she's in a coma, right?

161
00:06:17.498 --> 00:06:22.138
She looked like a perfect doll instead of a person.

162
00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:23.977
I didn't think I could hit her.

163
00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:25.837
- You tried to do it at first try. - Yes. However,

164
00:06:25.938 --> 00:06:28.178
I told Tae Hee what I was worried about,

165
00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:30.477
and she told me not to feel bad about it.

166
00:06:30.477 --> 00:06:33.248
She said it would better if we finish it at our first try...

167
00:06:33.248 --> 00:06:34.717
- At the first try. - rather than doing it many times.

168
00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:37.318
- That's what actors usually say. - I told myself to do it at once.

169
00:06:37.457 --> 00:06:39.628
So I hit her and succeeded at my first try.

170
00:06:39.628 --> 00:06:40.988
- At once? - That's a relief.

171
00:06:40.988 --> 00:06:43.157
However, her character was in a coma, but...

172
00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:44.897
- She could've flinched. - That's right.

173
00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:46.428
Then we would've botched the scene.

174
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.368
But she didn't even budge.

175
00:06:48.597 --> 00:06:50.238
- It's not easy to do. - It's really hard.

176
00:06:50.238 --> 00:06:51.738
Didn't she pass out?

177
00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:54.268
- Because you hit her too hard. - That's possible.

178
00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:56.477
- It's just acting, but... - Shall I show you?

179
00:06:56.477 --> 00:06:57.878
- Would you show us? - Yes. Would you like to see?

180
00:06:57.878 --> 00:06:59.078
- Let's do that. - First,

181
00:06:59.078 --> 00:07:00.847
if there's someone Hae Sun wants to be her partner...

182
00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:02.207
- Shall I go first? - Okay.

183
00:07:02.207 --> 00:07:04.047
Why do we get slapped on Happy Together so often?

184
00:07:04.448 --> 00:07:06.118
- I... - We get slapped too often.

185
00:07:06.118 --> 00:07:08.217
We got hit about six times last year alone.

186
00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:10.758
Hae Sun. Please don't hit him right away.

187
00:07:10.988 --> 00:07:12.988
- Rehearse first. - On Happy Together,

188
00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:15.357
we got hit 6 or 7 times per year on average.

189
00:07:15.357 --> 00:07:16.957
- I remember... - Is this a segment or something?

190
00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:19.998
As far as I remember, I have even been hit with a high kick.

191
00:07:19.998 --> 00:07:21.097
Go ahead.

192
00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:22.397
Last time. Gosh.

193
00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:26.868
- Sae Ho will be your partner. - Okay.

194
00:07:26.868 --> 00:07:28.607
- Me? I'm used to this. - Yes.

195
00:07:28.607 --> 00:07:29.678
Stay still.

196
00:07:29.678 --> 00:07:31.277
(The Thursday drama, "Sae Pal")

197
00:07:32.477 --> 00:07:34.047
You are my doll.

198
00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:37.047
Did you have a good day?

199
00:07:37.047 --> 00:07:38.318
(Scary)

200
00:07:42.787 --> 00:07:44.518
(Slapping)

201
00:07:45.457 --> 00:07:46.488
My goodness.

202
00:07:46.488 --> 00:07:47.688
(The hitting sound filled the studio.)

203
00:07:48.527 --> 00:07:50.498
(His soul left his body for a while.)

204
00:07:51.857 --> 00:07:53.597
- His cheek turned red. - Pass.

205
00:07:53.897 --> 00:07:54.897
Good job.

206
00:07:56.438 --> 00:07:57.498
His cheek is so red.

207
00:07:57.897 --> 00:07:59.868
- Your cheek shook. - I felt it.

208
00:07:59.868 --> 00:08:01.107
Even your neck shook.

209
00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:03.107
(Sae Ho, I wish you good luck for the New Year!)

210
00:08:03.777 --> 00:08:07.448
Next up is Hyun Moo's close friend.

211
00:08:07.448 --> 00:08:09.277
Soo Kyung is my neighbor.

212
00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:12.417
- That's right. - I heard it was hard to invite her.

213
00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:14.147
- Why? - While we were making an effort...

214
00:08:14.147 --> 00:08:16.618
to convince her to come on the show,

215
00:08:16.888 --> 00:08:19.157
Hyun Moo tried to stop her from appearing on Happy Together...

216
00:08:19.157 --> 00:08:20.988
instead of helping us convince her.

217
00:08:20.988 --> 00:08:23.058
- No way. - I didn't try to stop her.

218
00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:24.797
Do you think you can do that because you won the grand award?

219
00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:26.157
It wasn't like that.

220
00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:28.268
Are you meddling in the direction of the show now?

221
00:08:28.268 --> 00:08:29.638
Why did you try to stop her...

222
00:08:29.638 --> 00:08:33.307
It wasn't like that. When I got a call from the staff member,

223
00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:36.108
- I called Hyun Moo to consult him. - I see.

224
00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:38.608
He said, "There has been no news about you for a while,"

225
00:08:38.608 --> 00:08:41.508
"and you're not playing in a drama. Are there any stories to tell?"

226
00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:43.478
He looked down on her.

227
00:08:43.677 --> 00:08:46.077
- Just like he does to me. - How could you say that?

228
00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:47.687
- So... He didn't mean it that way. - I meant...

229
00:08:47.687 --> 00:08:49.958
- He was considerate for me. - Is that so?

230
00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.228
What made you decide to come here despite that?

231
00:08:53.228 --> 00:08:54.687
Even though there have been no news,

232
00:08:54.687 --> 00:08:57.527
I thought the viewers might want to see me.

233
00:08:57.527 --> 00:08:58.557
That's right.

234
00:08:58.557 --> 00:08:59.968
- And today's... - She's absolutely right.

235
00:08:59.968 --> 00:09:00.968
- Right. - She's right.

236
00:09:00.968 --> 00:09:02.968
- She can be here with no news. - That's right.

237
00:09:02.968 --> 00:09:04.998
There's one more reason I couldn't miss the opportunity.

238
00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:07.138
- Today's theme is "Queens Special". - Yes.

239
00:09:07.138 --> 00:09:08.638
I couldn't help but come here.

240
00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:10.437
(I can't be missed.)

241
00:09:10.437 --> 00:09:13.777
- She can create news on the show. - Of course.

242
00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:15.508
I tried to stop her because of the theme.

243
00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:17.577
How did you two become friends?

244
00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:18.677
- Exactly. - Exactly.

245
00:09:18.677 --> 00:09:21.547
There's a club of celebrities who live in our neighborhood.

246
00:09:21.547 --> 00:09:22.618
- Really? - Yes.

247
00:09:22.618 --> 00:09:24.258
However, weirdly,

248
00:09:24.258 --> 00:09:26.287
Hyun Moo is the only male member of the club.

249
00:09:26.527 --> 00:09:28.588
- My goodness. - I hate him so much.

250
00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:30.527
- It's not like that. - I hate you so much.

251
00:09:30.527 --> 00:09:32.758
- Hey. Why... - More importantly,

252
00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:35.598
- I didn't know our club name. - So?

253
00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:37.838
- It's "Geum and Ok". - What does that mean?

254
00:09:37.838 --> 00:09:40.238
The club members live in Geumho-dong and Oksu-dong.

255
00:09:40.638 --> 00:09:43.008
- He came up with that name too. - Did he come up with that name?

256
00:09:43.008 --> 00:09:44.777
- Yes, he did. - That's such an old-fashioned name.

257
00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:45.807
(Embarrassed)

258
00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:47.677
- Who are the members? - "Geum and Ok"?

259
00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:49.147
- Kim Ji Min. - Kim Ji Min.

260
00:09:49.147 --> 00:09:50.777
- Kim Ji Min? - Ji Min is also a member?

261
00:09:50.777 --> 00:09:52.417
And Song Ji Eun.

262
00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:53.888
- Song Ji Eun? - Yes.

263
00:09:53.888 --> 00:09:56.147
- And Actress Jung Yoo Min. - Right. So...

264
00:09:56.718 --> 00:10:00.488
I wondered if Hyun Moo meets each of us alone privately.

265
00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:03.057
- What are you talking about? - That came across my mind.

266
00:10:03.057 --> 00:10:05.827
Hey. Return the grand award. You brat.

267
00:10:05.827 --> 00:10:06.927
My goodness.

268
00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:10.498
- What's wrong with you? - We only gather and eat together.

269
00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:12.268
(Hae Sun's hand appears.)

270
00:10:12.268 --> 00:10:13.437
What's wrong with you? Look.

271
00:10:14.268 --> 00:10:16.378
- Gosh. What's that? - He should be punished.

272
00:10:16.378 --> 00:10:19.277
- Seriously. - Why should I get slapped?

273
00:10:19.277 --> 00:10:20.708
- It's unbelievable. - Go ahead, and slap him.

274
00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:21.907
- Please calm down. - Let's...

275
00:10:21.907 --> 00:10:23.777
- Let's let her finish first. - Okay.

276
00:10:23.777 --> 00:10:25.978
We might have to ask her to slap him.

277
00:10:25.978 --> 00:10:30.018
Another reason we became good friends is...

278
00:10:30.018 --> 00:10:33.157
- I have two puppies. - They're so cute.

279
00:10:33.157 --> 00:10:36.358
- Hyun Moo adores them so much. - I love them.

280
00:10:36.358 --> 00:10:37.458
Whenever he's free...

281
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.868
- That's not what you think. - He doesn't...

282
00:10:39.868 --> 00:10:42.368
He... That's a typical strategy.

283
00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:44.937
- No. That's an old-fashioned way. - Be careful, Soo Kyung.

284
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:46.067
Seriously.

285
00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:48.508
I asked her to send her puppies alone if she wasn't free.

286
00:10:48.508 --> 00:10:49.838
- I tell her that all the time. - That's what men usually say.

287
00:10:49.838 --> 00:10:51.838
"Send your puppies alone." What could that mean?

288
00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:54.348
The owner has to take her puppies to his house...

289
00:10:54.348 --> 00:10:55.807
and take them back home.

290
00:10:56.348 --> 00:10:58.447
- I was too naive. - Of course.

291
00:10:58.447 --> 00:10:59.817
Has he ever...

292
00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:02.687
Has he ever told you that he bought dog food or clothes...

293
00:11:02.687 --> 00:11:05.458
for your puppies? Just tell us that.

294
00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:08.657
He once told me that he bought dog food for my puppies,

295
00:11:09.388 --> 00:11:12.358
but I think he used that as an excuse to see me one more time.

296
00:11:12.358 --> 00:11:15.468
Buy her a meal instead of dog food for her puppies.

297
00:11:15.728 --> 00:11:18.498
He doesn't call you late at night, does he?

298
00:11:19.138 --> 00:11:20.167
Late at night?

299
00:11:21.238 --> 00:11:23.307
- No way. - Are you a pathological liar?

300
00:11:23.537 --> 00:11:25.378
Don't make up stories like that.

301
00:11:25.378 --> 00:11:27.147
- Why? - You're taken aback, right?

302
00:11:27.147 --> 00:11:28.907
- Let her finish. - It's because...

303
00:11:28.907 --> 00:11:29.947
Soo Kyung.

304
00:11:29.947 --> 00:11:32.177
- She wouldn't lie on the show. - Calling her at night isn't wrong.

305
00:11:32.177 --> 00:11:33.218
I haven't done that before.

306
00:11:33.218 --> 00:11:36.047
I think this is why he tried to stop her from appearing on this show.

307
00:11:36.047 --> 00:11:38.287
- This is why he tried to stop her. - Let's hear her out.

308
00:11:38.287 --> 00:11:40.527
- I was just thinking. - She's good.

309
00:11:41.187 --> 00:11:43.327
- He hasn't called me at night. - I see.

310
00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:44.697
- He never did that. - However,

311
00:11:44.697 --> 00:11:48.468
I loved your facial expression that looked like he's done so.

312
00:11:48.998 --> 00:11:51.937
- It made our staff feel satisfied. - I...

313
00:11:51.937 --> 00:11:53.708
- Don't edit this part out. - That was good.

314
00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:55.537
- You can use it for the preview. - She made me look bad.

315
00:11:55.537 --> 00:11:56.937
What are you talking about?

316
00:11:57.577 --> 00:11:59.008
Gosh. She's driving me crazy.

317
00:11:59.008 --> 00:12:00.177
(It's always fun to tease Hyun Moo.)

318
00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:03.878
When I see Se Jeong, she looks like a female version of Lee Seung Gi.

319
00:12:03.878 --> 00:12:05.417
She's good at everything including variety shows and acting.

320
00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:06.588
- She sings well too. - Right.

321
00:12:06.588 --> 00:12:07.687
- That's right. - That's not true.

322
00:12:07.687 --> 00:12:10.317
- You won two awards, right? - I am very grateful...

323
00:12:10.317 --> 00:12:12.417
- that I won two awards. - Really?

324
00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:16.228
I won the first award from "S" station.

325
00:12:16.228 --> 00:12:17.427
- She won the best challenge award. - Right.

326
00:12:17.427 --> 00:12:19.897
I didn't expect to win the award at all.

327
00:12:20.228 --> 00:12:22.768
When I gave my acceptance speech,

328
00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:25.397
- I forgot to mention many people. - I see.

329
00:12:25.397 --> 00:12:26.907
I only spoke gibberish.

330
00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:30.437
Since this is my first time...

331
00:12:30.437 --> 00:12:33.577
(She speaks incoherently.)

332
00:12:35.008 --> 00:12:37.547
The entertainers who gave me this opportunity...

333
00:12:37.547 --> 00:12:40.018
(She speaks gibberish.)

334
00:12:40.118 --> 00:12:42.787
So I told myself not to forget anyone...

335
00:12:42.787 --> 00:12:44.417
- that I should thank... - You prepared for it.

336
00:12:44.417 --> 00:12:47.657
if I would ever get invited to any awards ceremony just in case.

337
00:12:47.657 --> 00:12:49.628
- I wrote down their names on paper. - I see.

338
00:12:49.628 --> 00:12:51.827
I didn't know if I would win an award,

339
00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:54.327
but I decided to carry it with me just in case.

340
00:12:54.697 --> 00:12:56.868
- Fortunately, I won it. - You won the award.

341
00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:59.638
2017 KBS Drama Awards.

342
00:12:59.638 --> 00:13:03.307
(Se Jeong won Best New Actress that an actress can win only once.)

343
00:13:03.777 --> 00:13:04.807
Congratulations.

344
00:13:04.807 --> 00:13:06.077
Thank you very much.

345
00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.447
(The cheat sheet that caused a problem)

346
00:13:08.647 --> 00:13:10.647
I unfolded the note, read it,

347
00:13:10.647 --> 00:13:13.787
came back to my seat. Then I saw my manager was so surprised.

348
00:13:14.118 --> 00:13:15.888
He said, "Since you read that note,"

349
00:13:15.888 --> 00:13:18.988
"people will probably think you knew you would win the award."

350
00:13:19.588 --> 00:13:22.488
I'm telling you this to explain how it happened.

351
00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:24.598
- She's adorable. - That's good.

352
00:13:24.598 --> 00:13:27.067
- There was a twist in her story. - It had a twist.

353
00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:29.567
I prepared the note just in case, so please don't get the wrong idea.

354
00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:32.598
- I simply wanted to mention... - No one got the wrong idea.

355
00:13:32.598 --> 00:13:34.238
all the people I'm grateful for.

356
00:13:34.238 --> 00:13:35.968
Just as she said,

357
00:13:35.968 --> 00:13:39.608
- it's better to prepare a speech. - That's right.

358
00:13:39.608 --> 00:13:42.407
You become taken aback if you're not prepared.

359
00:13:42.407 --> 00:13:45.547
It's good to think about your speech in advance.

360
00:13:45.547 --> 00:13:48.588
How did your group members and your mother reacted?

361
00:13:48.588 --> 00:13:50.118
- I wonder how her mother reacted. - How did they react?

362
00:13:50.118 --> 00:13:51.787
As for my mom...

363
00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:56.598
I once said this on "Yu Hui Yeol's Sketchbook".

364
00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:59.258
I said that I hoped to win an award...

365
00:13:59.258 --> 00:14:02.667
in all the three fields, singing, acting, and variety shows.

366
00:14:03.268 --> 00:14:05.537
Last year, my wish came true.

367
00:14:05.537 --> 00:14:06.937
- In 2017? - Yes.

368
00:14:06.937 --> 00:14:08.037
- That's incredible. - My mom said,

369
00:14:08.037 --> 00:14:10.478
"Daughter, congratulations." She was so happy.

370
00:14:10.478 --> 00:14:12.807
Not only my family members,

371
00:14:12.807 --> 00:14:14.708
- but also my group members... - Gugudan members.

372
00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:17.677
They made a video of themselves watching the awards ceremony...

373
00:14:17.677 --> 00:14:19.218
on TV.

374
00:14:19.218 --> 00:14:21.287
At the end of my speech,

375
00:14:21.287 --> 00:14:24.388
I choked when I said, "Gugudan members."

376
00:14:25.287 --> 00:14:28.858
(She was grateful and sorry to her group members.)

377
00:14:30.598 --> 00:14:32.027
(Teary)

378
00:14:32.027 --> 00:14:33.297
My group members suddenly started crying...

379
00:14:33.628 --> 00:14:34.827
while saying, "My goodness. Se Jeong."

380
00:14:34.827 --> 00:14:37.638
They sent me the video of themselves crying.

381
00:14:37.638 --> 00:14:40.708
Watching the video made me want to cry.

382
00:14:40.708 --> 00:14:43.338
I'm always grateful for them. Thank you, guys.

383
00:14:43.838 --> 00:14:46.077
Did you just talk to your group members?

384
00:14:46.077 --> 00:14:47.277
There was a twist again.

385
00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:50.077
- You prepared a lot for the show. - She made a video letter.

386
00:14:50.077 --> 00:14:52.047
- You expressed your gratitude. - That's right.

387
00:14:52.047 --> 00:14:54.348
- Good for you. - You've made your dream come true.

388
00:14:54.348 --> 00:14:55.817
Do you have a new dream now?

389
00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:58.518
I reduced the length of time.

390
00:14:58.518 --> 00:14:59.687
- How? - You reduced it?

391
00:15:00.157 --> 00:15:02.327
To win three awards this year.

392
00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.758
- That's amazing. - My gosh.

393
00:15:04.758 --> 00:15:09.098
Last year, I won an award as a member of I.O.I.

394
00:15:09.098 --> 00:15:10.998
- This year, I hope... - As a member of Gugudan.

395
00:15:10.998 --> 00:15:12.138
I can win an award as a member of Gugudan.

396
00:15:12.138 --> 00:15:13.638
I will pull it off.

397
00:15:13.638 --> 00:15:15.638
- I see. That's a big goal. - Right.

398
00:15:15.638 --> 00:15:17.238
- That'd be a grand slam. - I'm sorry,

399
00:15:17.238 --> 00:15:18.838
but are you doing a personal interview?

400
00:15:19.108 --> 00:15:20.277
(2 different shows on 1 channel)

401
00:15:20.277 --> 00:15:22.047
Is it a monodrama or what?

402
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.417
One of our today's guests...

403
00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:26.248
voted for Se Jeong during the contest.

404
00:15:26.248 --> 00:15:27.447
- Really? - At that time?

405
00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:28.748
- Who is it? - Who is it?

406
00:15:28.748 --> 00:15:29.917
- It's me. - Really?

407
00:15:29.917 --> 00:15:31.388
- Bo Reum? - Really?

408
00:15:31.388 --> 00:15:34.758
- I was a fan of yours. - Thank you.

409
00:15:34.758 --> 00:15:37.498
- I was her fan. - You were one of the fan producers.

410
00:15:37.498 --> 00:15:39.427
- It's true. - You were a producer.

411
00:15:40.128 --> 00:15:42.567
- It'll be on the screen. - I didn't know that.

412
00:15:42.768 --> 00:15:43.768
Producer Han.

413
00:15:43.768 --> 00:15:45.138
(The pretty Producer Han)

414
00:15:45.138 --> 00:15:47.167
I wish you were the producer of our show.

415
00:15:47.838 --> 00:15:49.208
What are you talking about?

416
00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:51.838
I'm too embarrassed to see Bo Reum.

417
00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:53.807
I think he's still hibernating.

418
00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:55.277
(His sense of humor is still hibernating.)

419
00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:57.777
I really wish she were the producer of our show.

420
00:15:57.777 --> 00:16:00.647
When did you become her fan? When she started standing out or...

421
00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:03.988
At the beginning when I saw her self introduction video,

422
00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:05.758
- I became her fan. - Really?

423
00:16:05.758 --> 00:16:09.388
- I've been a trainee like she did. - That's right.

424
00:16:09.388 --> 00:16:12.427
So I really enjoyed the show.

425
00:16:12.427 --> 00:16:14.697
Do you think she would've become a member if she joined the contest?

426
00:16:14.697 --> 00:16:15.968
- Of course I do. - Are you sure?

427
00:16:15.968 --> 00:16:17.868
- Yes, she would've made it. - Why do you think so?

428
00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:20.768
First of all, whatever that show was about,

429
00:16:20.768 --> 00:16:23.777
the contestants need to know how to make people laugh.

430
00:16:24.177 --> 00:16:25.907
She's good at this and has this.

431
00:16:25.907 --> 00:16:28.407
"She's good at this and has this."

432
00:16:28.407 --> 00:16:31.417
- "She's good at this and has this." - She's funny.

433
00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:34.118
- She's perfect in everything. - She's perfect.

434
00:16:34.547 --> 00:16:36.817
What about Hyeon Gyeong? Tell us honestly.

435
00:16:36.817 --> 00:16:38.358
- Well, I... - She wouldn't have made it.

436
00:16:38.718 --> 00:16:40.458
- I could just tell. - Why?

437
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.858
- It's... - I have those qualities too.

438
00:16:42.858 --> 00:16:44.527
- I didn't mean that. - Hyeon Gyeong said...

439
00:16:44.527 --> 00:16:46.598
- that she has the same qualities. - Why?

440
00:16:46.598 --> 00:16:47.897
- You have those qualities, - Tell us honestly.

441
00:16:47.897 --> 00:16:50.037
- but I saw her dance before. - Dance?

442
00:16:50.037 --> 00:16:53.537
- She wasn't good at dance. - That's true.

443
00:16:53.537 --> 00:16:56.638
- Oh, dance? - Soo Kyung would've failed.

444
00:16:56.638 --> 00:16:58.978
- She would've drawn attention... - Why?

445
00:16:59.508 --> 00:17:00.947
for a little unusual reason.

446
00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.147
"What is she doing there?"

447
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.047
Just like Jung Jun Ha on "Show Me the Money".

448
00:17:05.277 --> 00:17:07.617
- Exactly. - That's how it feels like.

449
00:17:07.617 --> 00:17:09.117
Soo Kyung would have...

450
00:17:09.117 --> 00:17:10.887
- Would you have voted for me? - Sorry?

451
00:17:10.887 --> 00:17:13.087
- Would you have voted for me? - If you had been on the show,

452
00:17:13.087 --> 00:17:15.158
I would have liked you so much,

453
00:17:15.158 --> 00:17:16.658
but voted for someone else.

454
00:17:17.297 --> 00:17:20.468
It's because the winners would form an idol group.

455
00:17:20.468 --> 00:17:22.728
Let's get back to Se Jeong's story.

456
00:17:23.238 --> 00:17:25.637
Se Jeong was the star of "Produce 101".

457
00:17:26.137 --> 00:17:29.307
You must have felt different when you watched the second season.

458
00:17:29.307 --> 00:17:30.738
Did you vote for a particular contestant?

459
00:17:31.077 --> 00:17:35.777
At first, I became popular because of my funny side.

460
00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:38.448
- So I liked Yoon Ji Sung. - Yoon Ji Sung.

461
00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:41.587
- He was so funny. - He's very funny.

462
00:17:41.587 --> 00:17:44.287
- Ong Seong Wu stood out later. - Ong Seong Wu.

463
00:17:44.287 --> 00:17:46.857
The two of them were so funny, so I was rooting for them.

464
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.057
(Seong Wu and Ji Sung made a great comedy duo.)

465
00:17:48.158 --> 00:17:51.297
I heard you were nosy to Wanna One members.

466
00:17:51.297 --> 00:17:53.297
This is embarrassing.

467
00:17:53.297 --> 00:17:54.898
This is unexpected.

468
00:17:54.898 --> 00:17:57.297
- This is really... - I don't think you're a nosy type.

469
00:17:57.297 --> 00:18:01.208
Singers exchange their song albums with each other.

470
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:02.837
Before I gave them my album,

471
00:18:02.837 --> 00:18:05.537
I wrote a letter on my album jacket from the top to bottom.

472
00:18:06.248 --> 00:18:08.208
It's because...

473
00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:10.148
being on that show is a rare experience.

474
00:18:10.148 --> 00:18:13.547
I told them to stay grateful and not to fight one another.

475
00:18:13.547 --> 00:18:14.688
It was all kind of typical advice,

476
00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:15.817
but I wrote what I wanted to tell them.

477
00:18:15.817 --> 00:18:17.587
Does that mean you have fought with your group members?

478
00:18:17.587 --> 00:18:19.258
- No. Never. - No?

479
00:18:19.258 --> 00:18:21.387
- No. - You got caught.

480
00:18:21.387 --> 00:18:23.898
Didn't you pull Jung Chae Yeon's hair out?

481
00:18:24.258 --> 00:18:26.768
Actually, you take it for granted...

482
00:18:26.768 --> 00:18:29.468
while you can eat with your group members,

483
00:18:29.468 --> 00:18:31.337
but you come to miss those days when you can't.

484
00:18:31.337 --> 00:18:34.668
Since I.O.I was a project group to only last for a year,

485
00:18:34.668 --> 00:18:37.577
you realized that when the year has almost passed.

486
00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:39.208
While I was working as a member of I.O.I,

487
00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:42.948
Kim Hee Chul said, "Try not to get tired too soon."

488
00:18:43.347 --> 00:18:45.547
His comment gave me so much strength,

489
00:18:45.547 --> 00:18:47.448
and it kept me going during the time.

490
00:18:47.448 --> 00:18:51.958
I hoped I could be helpful for any one of the 11 members.

491
00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.928
So I gave it to them,

492
00:18:54.357 --> 00:18:56.998
but I couldn't even see their faces since then.

493
00:18:57.357 --> 00:18:59.097
- You were so embarrassed. - I felt so embarrassed...

494
00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.827
- after giving them the letter. - You wrote it from your heart.

495
00:19:01.827 --> 00:19:03.438
- After I gave them the letter, - It's touching.

496
00:19:03.438 --> 00:19:05.438
I thought, "What will they think?"

497
00:19:05.438 --> 00:19:07.238
"I was too meddlesome."

498
00:19:07.238 --> 00:19:10.508
The members in my group asked, "Why did you do that?"

499
00:19:10.508 --> 00:19:13.077
Please don't misunderstand. You can talk comfortably to me.

500
00:19:13.077 --> 00:19:14.847
Excuse me. Who are you talking to?

501
00:19:14.847 --> 00:19:16.448
- It's like personal broadcasting. - What are you doing?

502
00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.718
- She has a cameraman with her. - Really?

503
00:19:19.718 --> 00:19:20.718
Se Jeong.

504
00:19:20.718 --> 00:19:22.287
There are so many video messages in this one episode.

505
00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:25.918
There have been 3 or 4, right? She sends a lot of video messages.

506
00:19:25.918 --> 00:19:28.527
When you get big attention...

507
00:19:28.527 --> 00:19:30.857
- without any experiences, - That's right.

508
00:19:30.998 --> 00:19:33.097
you get a mental breakdown.

509
00:19:33.097 --> 00:19:34.768
"This isn't the life of a singer I had imagined."

510
00:19:34.768 --> 00:19:36.027
You can come to think that way.

511
00:19:36.027 --> 00:19:39.398
However, as you go on, everything will improve...

512
00:19:39.398 --> 00:19:42.768
and you will have fun. I hope they wouldn't tire themselves out.

513
00:19:42.768 --> 00:19:44.277
Please tell them not to tire themselves out.

514
00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:47.748
Don't tire yourself out. This life really is fun.

515
00:19:47.748 --> 00:19:49.877
You will know soon enough.

516
00:19:51.018 --> 00:19:52.047
"You will know soon enough."

517
00:19:52.218 --> 00:19:54.847
- Isn't she cute? - She is so cute.

518
00:19:54.847 --> 00:19:55.948
(She successfully sends the last video message.)

519
00:19:55.948 --> 00:19:59.087
Let's move on. These two are best friends.

520
00:19:59.087 --> 00:20:01.527
With Hyeon Gyeong is a passionate woman,

521
00:20:01.527 --> 00:20:02.728
Han Bo Reum.

522
00:20:03.127 --> 00:20:04.297
Hello.

523
00:20:04.557 --> 00:20:07.668
- It has been a while. - She is one of the celebrities...

524
00:20:07.668 --> 00:20:09.637
Happy Together made popular.

525
00:20:09.637 --> 00:20:13.367
Did Hyeon Gyeong give you any advice on being on a variety show?

526
00:20:13.367 --> 00:20:15.668
Hyeon Gyeong is a senior celebrity when it comes to variety shows.

527
00:20:15.668 --> 00:20:17.508
Upon learning that I will be here,

528
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.807
she said that we need to prepare ourselves.

529
00:20:20.877 --> 00:20:22.748
- You talked. - Yes.

530
00:20:22.748 --> 00:20:24.577
Since my acquaintance is here, I might get more screen time.

531
00:20:24.577 --> 00:20:26.787
- She is more excited than me. - Since she is here,

532
00:20:26.918 --> 00:20:28.317
I want to ride on her coattails.

533
00:20:28.317 --> 00:20:30.158
It's understandable to think that way.

534
00:20:30.158 --> 00:20:32.117
Last year, Bo Reum...

535
00:20:32.117 --> 00:20:34.228
starred in "Confession Couple".

536
00:20:34.228 --> 00:20:36.627
You received a lot of love for playing a girl crush,

537
00:20:36.627 --> 00:20:38.097
Yoon Bo Reum.

538
00:20:38.097 --> 00:20:40.468
I heard your personality is similar to that of the character.

539
00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:42.627
Yes. Most of the characters I played...

540
00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:46.537
were mysterious or going through first love.

541
00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:50.637
When I am around my friends,

542
00:20:50.637 --> 00:20:52.178
I am exactly like Yoon Bo Reum.

543
00:20:52.178 --> 00:20:56.148
- I see. - I acted with Heo Jung Min...

544
00:20:56.148 --> 00:20:57.777
- for the second time. - Heo Jung Min.

545
00:20:57.777 --> 00:21:00.387
He said, "She won't need to act. This character is her."

546
00:21:00.387 --> 00:21:02.617
- "They are the same." - Yes. He said that.

547
00:21:02.617 --> 00:21:05.518
Some say you received a role in "Confession Couple"...

548
00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:07.658
- thanks to Happy Together. - Well...

549
00:21:07.658 --> 00:21:10.698
Before the director cast me,

550
00:21:10.698 --> 00:21:13.797
he called the production crew of Happy Together.

551
00:21:13.797 --> 00:21:16.498
He asked what I as like.

552
00:21:16.498 --> 00:21:18.968
They said, "She works hard and is full of charms."

553
00:21:18.968 --> 00:21:20.637
The production crew said that.

554
00:21:21.137 --> 00:21:23.577
That's how I received a role.

555
00:21:23.577 --> 00:21:25.938
- That's good. - That's good.

556
00:21:25.938 --> 00:21:29.248
You showed you cheerleading skills in "Confession Coupe".

557
00:21:29.617 --> 00:21:32.178
I heard you practiced for six months.

558
00:21:32.547 --> 00:21:35.688
When I asked cheerleaders how long it takes to learn,

559
00:21:35.748 --> 00:21:38.087
they said they learned the steps for six months.

560
00:21:38.317 --> 00:21:40.887
To take the stage, they learn the moves for a year.

561
00:21:40.887 --> 00:21:43.557
Since I had time in-between shoots,

562
00:21:43.557 --> 00:21:46.057
- I took a lesson for a month... - You practiced.

563
00:21:46.057 --> 00:21:49.268
and practiced for a month...

564
00:21:49.268 --> 00:21:51.998
- on my own. - I see.

565
00:21:51.998 --> 00:21:54.908
Let's see the routine...

566
00:21:54.908 --> 00:21:56.337
Bo Reum has practiced.

567
00:21:56.337 --> 00:21:58.238
(How good is Bo Reum at cheerleading?)

568
00:22:00.748 --> 00:22:02.448
(Her moves are big.)

569
00:22:03.377 --> 00:22:06.178
- She is good. - She is good.

570
00:22:06.988 --> 00:22:09.658
(Their jaws drop.)

571
00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:11.857
(She turns in the perfect angle.)

572
00:22:11.857 --> 00:22:14.087
- She is like a cheerleader. - Seriously.

573
00:22:14.758 --> 00:22:16.627
(Anyone would think she is a cheerleader.)

574
00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:17.827
She is good.

575
00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.998
(For her role,)

576
00:22:20.998 --> 00:22:23.498
(she put her effort and passion into this routine.)

577
00:22:23.498 --> 00:22:24.498
Look at that.

578
00:22:25.097 --> 00:22:26.307
Show us!

579
00:22:26.307 --> 00:22:27.337
(She is a girl crush.)

580
00:22:30.178 --> 00:22:32.708
(Let's go.)

581
00:22:32.708 --> 00:22:33.948
She is good.

582
00:22:33.948 --> 00:22:35.847
(Powerful)

583
00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:38.748
(She puts her arms and legs into work.)

584
00:22:39.587 --> 00:22:41.787
(This is the class of the leader of Asura Cheerleading Team.)

585
00:22:42.817 --> 00:22:45.018
(The performance ends here today.)

586
00:22:46.428 --> 00:22:48.827
- You are so good. - You are so good.

587
00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:50.557
- It was impressive. - She isn't even short of breath.

588
00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:52.097
She isn't even short of breath.

589
00:22:52.097 --> 00:22:53.867
(Of course she is short of breath.)

590
00:22:53.867 --> 00:22:54.867
Did you see that?

591
00:22:54.867 --> 00:22:57.537
Bo Reum and Hyeon Gyeong...

592
00:22:57.537 --> 00:22:59.398
prepared a performance.

593
00:22:59.398 --> 00:23:01.708
- Hyeon Gyeong is waiting. - Hyeon Gyeong, let's go.

594
00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:02.908
(It's a collaboration between a teacher and a student.)

595
00:23:03.077 --> 00:23:04.107
("Boombayah" by Black Pink)

596
00:23:04.107 --> 00:23:05.807
Isn't this a song by Black Pink?

597
00:23:05.807 --> 00:23:07.148
- "Boombayah". - "Boombayah".

598
00:23:07.148 --> 00:23:08.307
(Hyeon Gyeong is nervous while Bo Reum is relaxed.)

599
00:23:08.448 --> 00:23:09.577
"Boombayah".

600
00:23:12.648 --> 00:23:13.648
Look at them.

601
00:23:13.648 --> 00:23:14.648
(Are they in sync today?)

602
00:23:14.648 --> 00:23:16.817
(No, they aren't.)

603
00:23:17.857 --> 00:23:20.188
(Hyeon Gyeong looks like she is spinning a hat.)

604
00:23:20.188 --> 00:23:21.287
Bo Reum.

605
00:23:22.127 --> 00:23:23.527
She is good.

606
00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:24.597
(The teacher is perfect from head to toe.)

607
00:23:25.297 --> 00:23:28.728
(However, the student...)

608
00:23:28.728 --> 00:23:31.067
- Bo Reum is good. - She can't keep up.

609
00:23:31.738 --> 00:23:33.938
(Guys.)

610
00:23:33.938 --> 00:23:35.008
My goodness.

611
00:23:35.107 --> 00:23:37.577
(The guys are busy laughing.)

612
00:23:38.478 --> 00:23:41.678
(The same dance routine looks different.)

613
00:23:43.877 --> 00:23:44.877
Hyeon Gyeong.

614
00:23:44.877 --> 00:23:46.117
(Good work, Hyeon Gyeong.)

615
00:23:47.047 --> 00:23:49.988
- She did a good job. - Hyeon Gyeong did it.

616
00:23:49.988 --> 00:23:51.918
- Hyeon Gyeong. - I did an amazing job, right?

617
00:23:51.918 --> 00:23:53.758
- Right. - I am sorry to ask,

618
00:23:53.758 --> 00:23:55.627
but why did you perform with Bo Reum?

619
00:23:55.827 --> 00:23:58.327
Why don't we let Hyeon Gyeong perform by herself?

620
00:23:58.698 --> 00:24:00.327
Why do you say that when I danced the same way?

621
00:24:00.768 --> 00:24:02.268
- What was different? - You did everything perfectly,

622
00:24:02.268 --> 00:24:04.698
- but the way you moved your arms... - You spun your arms so timidly.

623
00:24:04.698 --> 00:24:05.768
(Does she really have to ask?)

624
00:24:05.768 --> 00:24:07.567
It looked like you were receiving physical therapy.

625
00:24:07.908 --> 00:24:09.777
- Seriously. - The way you spun your arms...

626
00:24:09.777 --> 00:24:10.807
made us nervous.

627
00:24:10.807 --> 00:24:12.107
Her headbanging...

628
00:24:12.107 --> 00:24:14.547
made me think she is Kim Kyung Ho.

629
00:24:15.708 --> 00:24:16.877
(Which one is Kim Kyung Ho?)

630
00:24:16.877 --> 00:24:18.518
- When did you get here? - It's Kim Kyung Ho!

631
00:24:18.617 --> 00:24:19.617
When did you get here?

632
00:24:19.617 --> 00:24:21.617
In any case, she improved.

633
00:24:21.617 --> 00:24:23.018
Her skills were upgraded.

634
00:24:23.018 --> 00:24:24.688
- She improved a lot. - Yes.

635
00:24:24.688 --> 00:24:26.658
When I was on Happy Together for the second time,

636
00:24:26.658 --> 00:24:28.587
I danced to "Pick Me".

637
00:24:28.587 --> 00:24:30.797
Compared to that time, she improved so much.

638
00:24:30.797 --> 00:24:31.898
- She did, right? - Yes.

639
00:24:31.898 --> 00:24:33.468
- Seriously. - She improved so much.

640
00:24:33.468 --> 00:24:36.398
You learned this move from Bo Reum.

641
00:24:36.398 --> 00:24:37.398
- Yes. - This one.

642
00:24:37.398 --> 00:24:39.168
Would you show us what it's supposed to look like?

643
00:24:39.168 --> 00:24:42.137
- Bo Reum will lose weight. - I am exhausted.

644
00:24:42.137 --> 00:24:44.307
Are you an aerobics teacher?

645
00:24:44.908 --> 00:24:47.448
- You look like one. - Perhaps she opened a studio.

646
00:24:47.648 --> 00:24:49.777
Bo Reum will show us what the dance looks like.

647
00:24:49.777 --> 00:24:50.978
Let's go.

648
00:24:51.948 --> 00:24:52.988
My goodness.

649
00:24:53.018 --> 00:24:54.317
- My goodness. - Is that the same dance?

650
00:24:54.518 --> 00:24:55.817
It looks completely different.

651
00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:58.258
- This is how the dance goes. - This is how the dance goes.

652
00:25:00.258 --> 00:25:02.428
(A good example and a bad example)

653
00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:05.127
My goodness.

654
00:25:05.127 --> 00:25:06.827
(Is this what Inchworm Dance looks like?)

655
00:25:07.768 --> 00:25:09.768
(She ends the performance in a lovely way.)

656
00:25:09.968 --> 00:25:11.037
That was great.

657
00:25:11.037 --> 00:25:12.498
(Thumbs up.)

658
00:25:13.668 --> 00:25:14.738
It was the same.

659
00:25:15.037 --> 00:25:17.438
Se Jeong, please close your mouth. Dust will go in.

660
00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:19.208
- Dust will go in. - It looked very different.

661
00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:21.577
- It did, right? - I was so surprised.

662
00:25:21.577 --> 00:25:23.218
Se Jeong was surprised, too.

663
00:25:23.418 --> 00:25:24.978
She is a great dancer.

664
00:25:25.277 --> 00:25:27.317
What is it, Soo Kyung? Do you want to give it a go?

665
00:25:29.047 --> 00:25:30.387
This dance is very easy.

666
00:25:30.387 --> 00:25:31.488
- I will give it a go. - Okay.

667
00:25:31.658 --> 00:25:32.988
She is the best.

668
00:25:33.327 --> 00:25:35.027
You should refuse for once.

669
00:25:35.027 --> 00:25:37.428
This is Soo Kyung's strength.

670
00:25:37.428 --> 00:25:38.428
Why are you doing everything you are asked to do?

671
00:25:38.428 --> 00:25:41.597
This is why we are thankful to have Soo Kyung in a variety show.

672
00:25:41.597 --> 00:25:44.037
She never refuses to do something.

673
00:25:44.037 --> 00:25:45.738
- Soo Kyung let go. - Go up.

674
00:25:45.738 --> 00:25:46.807
- Then do this. - She was always like that.

675
00:25:46.807 --> 00:25:48.307
She was always like that.

676
00:25:48.637 --> 00:25:51.107
- What's wrong? - That was great. Let's go.

677
00:25:51.277 --> 00:25:53.047
- In 3, 4. - Let's go.

678
00:25:53.607 --> 00:25:54.708
What is that?

679
00:25:54.708 --> 00:25:55.807
(Her dance looks different.)

680
00:25:55.807 --> 00:25:57.847
(Creaking)

681
00:25:57.847 --> 00:25:59.117
Do the body roll.

682
00:26:00.787 --> 00:26:02.518
(I don't know what to do with that student.)

683
00:26:02.518 --> 00:26:03.758
She is so funny.

684
00:26:03.758 --> 00:26:05.018
It looks like she's starting a car.

685
00:26:05.018 --> 00:26:06.827
Isn't she a wooden doll?

686
00:26:06.827 --> 00:26:07.928
It looks like she is starting a car.

687
00:26:07.928 --> 00:26:09.797
(She is as bad as Hyeon Gyeong.)

688
00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.597
(After the Inchworm Dance comes the Wooden Doll Dance.)

689
00:26:11.597 --> 00:26:12.928
She is a wooden doll.

690
00:26:13.928 --> 00:26:15.127
(She ends the performance in a cute way.)

691
00:26:16.998 --> 00:26:18.337
I love how cheerful she is.

692
00:26:18.337 --> 00:26:19.438
- I love her. - It was lovely.

693
00:26:19.438 --> 00:26:23.077
- Soo Kyung never turns us down. - Hae Sun, give it a go.

694
00:26:23.438 --> 00:26:26.077
I am an actress who can't dance.

695
00:26:26.077 --> 00:26:28.047
Still, I will give it a try.

696
00:26:29.408 --> 00:26:31.418
I lack consistency.

697
00:26:31.418 --> 00:26:32.418
Let's go.

698
00:26:32.777 --> 00:26:34.188
I bet Hae Sun can dance well.

699
00:26:34.188 --> 00:26:35.448
- I know. - Let's go.

700
00:26:37.857 --> 00:26:40.027
(Surprised)

701
00:26:41.228 --> 00:26:42.688
(She completely changes.)

702
00:26:43.527 --> 00:26:45.498
(She walks seductively.)

703
00:26:45.627 --> 00:26:46.698
She is good.

704
00:26:46.698 --> 00:26:47.698
(Sexy)

705
00:26:47.698 --> 00:26:49.067
(She kills the body roll.)

706
00:26:50.468 --> 00:26:52.537
(She is the best.)

707
00:26:53.408 --> 00:26:54.768
(She loves twists.)

708
00:26:55.607 --> 00:26:57.678
(Respect)

709
00:26:57.678 --> 00:26:59.748
What is going on?

710
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:02.708
(I will command the studio.)

711
00:27:03.748 --> 00:27:04.817
My goodness.

712
00:27:04.847 --> 00:27:05.877
(Kiss)

713
00:27:06.387 --> 00:27:08.587
(You already fell for me.)

714
00:27:10.317 --> 00:27:12.287
(They give her a standing ovation.)

715
00:27:13.287 --> 00:27:14.357
(The seductive performance ends.)

716
00:27:14.357 --> 00:27:15.387
That was incredible.

717
00:27:15.387 --> 00:27:17.158
- She was incredible. - Seriously.

718
00:27:17.158 --> 00:27:18.998
Why are you hiding your face?

719
00:27:18.998 --> 00:27:21.097
- What are you doing? - Stop it.

720
00:27:22.198 --> 00:27:24.637
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

721
00:27:24.637 --> 00:27:25.898
Your hair will become a mess.

722
00:27:26.637 --> 00:27:27.768
It was the best.

723
00:27:29.008 --> 00:27:30.777
She made Soo Kyung's performance look shabby.

724
00:27:31.238 --> 00:27:33.408
- She did so well. - Thank you.

725
00:27:34.547 --> 00:27:36.577
(She is the queen of optimism.)

726
00:27:36.978 --> 00:27:38.847
- "Thank you." - She is cheerful.

727
00:27:39.688 --> 00:27:41.087
You will go home thankful.

728
00:27:41.188 --> 00:27:43.918
I will be thankful for the rest of the day.

729
00:27:44.718 --> 00:27:47.658
Hae Sun played Nurse Hwang...

730
00:27:47.658 --> 00:27:49.287
in a drama, "Yong Pal".

731
00:27:49.287 --> 00:27:52.998
I heard you make people quake with fear.

732
00:27:53.327 --> 00:27:56.127
I don't have a TV at home.

733
00:27:56.127 --> 00:27:59.537
I didn't know so many people watched the drama.

734
00:27:59.537 --> 00:28:00.708
- You didn't know. - No.

735
00:28:00.708 --> 00:28:03.077
I didn't realize that I had become more popular.

736
00:28:03.077 --> 00:28:05.577
One day, I walked into the snack bar...

737
00:28:05.577 --> 00:28:08.678
I frequent to eat something.

738
00:28:09.948 --> 00:28:12.847
Like the domino tiles, people at the table went...

739
00:28:12.847 --> 00:28:14.387
(The customers began to quake with fear.)

740
00:28:14.387 --> 00:28:16.958
They were so surprised. I found it so strange...

741
00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:19.387
that I headed home without eating...

742
00:28:19.387 --> 00:28:20.787
and took the elevator.

743
00:28:20.887 --> 00:28:22.787
My reflection in the mirror shocked me.

744
00:28:22.787 --> 00:28:24.458
- Why? - I was Nurse Hwang.

745
00:28:24.458 --> 00:28:27.428
I was wearing the same makeup and costume.

746
00:28:27.428 --> 00:28:29.698
I had walked into the snack bar...

747
00:28:29.698 --> 00:28:31.567
right after the shoot.

748
00:28:31.567 --> 00:28:33.238
People's reaction shocked me so much...

749
00:28:33.238 --> 00:28:35.668
that I began to be more careful.

750
00:28:35.668 --> 00:28:39.178
People get surprised when you look exactly like...

751
00:28:39.178 --> 00:28:41.248
- a character in a drama. - That's right.

752
00:28:41.248 --> 00:28:42.547
They can be flustered.

753
00:28:42.547 --> 00:28:43.877
This happened...

754
00:28:43.877 --> 00:28:46.018
when I was starring in "Don't Dare to Dream".

755
00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:50.087
I asked a passerby for a direction. After talking to me for a while,

756
00:28:50.087 --> 00:28:52.688
she said, "You are the one in the drama, right?"

757
00:28:52.688 --> 00:28:54.387
I became so flustered...

758
00:28:54.387 --> 00:28:57.297
that I pretended like I wasn't. "No."

759
00:28:57.527 --> 00:28:59.668
I said that I am not that person.

760
00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:01.498
She is good at pretending to be a non-celebrity.

761
00:29:01.498 --> 00:29:03.867
It was hilarious...

762
00:29:03.968 --> 00:29:09.268
since I was wearing the costume and glasses for the shoot.

763
00:29:09.268 --> 00:29:11.478
- You were wearing the full set. - I was obviously that person.

764
00:29:11.777 --> 00:29:15.307
As I walked away, she shouted,

765
00:29:15.948 --> 00:29:18.018
"I will enjoy watching the drama."

766
00:29:18.948 --> 00:29:20.188
"I am rooting for you."

767
00:29:20.718 --> 00:29:22.688
"The drama is good."

768
00:29:22.688 --> 00:29:24.688
- My goodness. - I was so flustered...

769
00:29:24.688 --> 00:29:26.887
that I walked faster.

770
00:29:27.887 --> 00:29:30.557
I walked like this without looking back.

771
00:29:30.557 --> 00:29:32.498
I understand why you did that.

772
00:29:32.498 --> 00:29:35.867
There was no way to mend the situation.

773
00:29:36.337 --> 00:29:37.898
Although you were appreciative of her words...

774
00:29:37.898 --> 00:29:39.268
- She had to run away. - Yes.

775
00:29:39.268 --> 00:29:40.867
Since I denied it so vehemently,

776
00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:42.877
- I had to keep up with the act. - She is so cute.

777
00:29:42.877 --> 00:29:44.678
That was hilarious.

778
00:29:44.678 --> 00:29:46.478
Some celebrities can't hide their identities...

779
00:29:46.478 --> 00:29:48.448
- even with a mask. - That's right.

780
00:29:48.448 --> 00:29:50.718
- Your voice can give you away. - That's right.

781
00:29:50.718 --> 00:29:54.887
I bet everyone recognizes your voice on the phone.

782
00:29:54.887 --> 00:29:56.418
- Everyone recognizes my voice. - I knew it.

783
00:29:56.418 --> 00:29:59.787
I received a call advertising from funeral services.

784
00:29:59.887 --> 00:30:01.887
"I will have to hang up because I am busy."

785
00:30:02.158 --> 00:30:03.658
"You are Park Myung Soo, right?"

786
00:30:04.557 --> 00:30:06.728
"You are at the age to sign with funeral services."

787
00:30:07.168 --> 00:30:09.067
"You are at the age to sign with funeral services."

788
00:30:09.127 --> 00:30:13.768
"With 10 dollars a month, we will oversee the procedures."

789
00:30:15.468 --> 00:30:18.508
- Your voice is very distinctive. - That's right.

790
00:30:18.508 --> 00:30:20.277
- Anyone can recognize it. - Yes.

791
00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:24.218
Hae Sun, you surprised the employees of the security checkpoint.

792
00:30:24.218 --> 00:30:25.218
What happened?

793
00:30:26.218 --> 00:30:30.518
I went to the airport to attend a cultural event in Jeju Island.

794
00:30:30.857 --> 00:30:32.928
My suitcase...

795
00:30:32.988 --> 00:30:36.127
went in and out of the machine three times.

796
00:30:36.498 --> 00:30:41.168
Then the employees said, "We will have to search the bag."

797
00:30:41.168 --> 00:30:44.597
I was asked to take everything out. I was so surprised that I asked,

798
00:30:44.698 --> 00:30:46.238
"What is going on?"

799
00:30:46.238 --> 00:30:48.708
Apparently, I was carrying a weapon.

800
00:30:48.708 --> 00:30:49.708
What?

801
00:30:50.077 --> 00:30:51.137
Why did you do that?

802
00:30:51.277 --> 00:30:56.107
I am the type of a person who carried everything in the bag.

803
00:30:56.107 --> 00:30:58.748
- I carry things I might need. - Just in case.

804
00:30:58.748 --> 00:31:02.148
Yes, I have scissors of all sizes. Big one, small one, and medium ones.

805
00:31:02.148 --> 00:31:05.258
The medium ones go in each bag just in case.

806
00:31:05.258 --> 00:31:08.127
I also carry a knife because I might eat fruits.

807
00:31:08.127 --> 00:31:09.627
Do you carry a knife?

808
00:31:09.728 --> 00:31:11.597
What are you, Santa Claus?

809
00:31:11.797 --> 00:31:14.728
- Do you ever use those items? - I use them very often.

810
00:31:14.728 --> 00:31:18.768
I had scissors, knives, and tweezers.

811
00:31:18.768 --> 00:31:21.738
- You were a terrorist. - I had over 10 of them.

812
00:31:21.738 --> 00:31:24.178
In the drama,

813
00:31:24.178 --> 00:31:28.077
I had stabbed the director of the hospital.

814
00:31:28.607 --> 00:31:30.478
It happened right after the episode aired.

815
00:31:30.678 --> 00:31:32.547
An employee came to me and said,

816
00:31:32.748 --> 00:31:36.188
"Nurse Hwang, you carry knives and scissors..."

817
00:31:36.458 --> 00:31:39.518
"in real life. Gosh, it's scary."

818
00:31:39.518 --> 00:31:41.387
He said that.

819
00:31:41.857 --> 00:31:44.458
It's convenient to have people like her around.

820
00:31:44.458 --> 00:31:46.698
- It tires me out. - They have everything.

821
00:31:46.698 --> 00:31:49.268
When I go to the countryside for two days,

822
00:31:49.268 --> 00:31:51.067
I carry three trunks.

823
00:31:51.067 --> 00:31:52.867
- For a two-day trip? - Why do you do that?

824
00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:55.607
My friends do this as a joke.

825
00:31:55.607 --> 00:31:59.748
"Let's think of the most ridiculous item she might have."

826
00:32:00.008 --> 00:32:02.377
- The most ridiculous item. - That's right.

827
00:32:02.377 --> 00:32:04.547
Everyone came up with an item.

828
00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:08.248
"She won't have this. A hammer." However, I had a hammer.

829
00:32:08.887 --> 00:32:11.357
- I had a hammer in my bag. - Why did you have a hammer?

830
00:32:11.357 --> 00:32:13.857
The next time, they did this. "This one is absolutely ridiculous."

831
00:32:13.857 --> 00:32:15.458
- "This is game over." - What was it?

832
00:32:15.527 --> 00:32:16.928
"She won't have a screwdriver."

833
00:32:17.357 --> 00:32:18.357
A screwdriver.

834
00:32:18.357 --> 00:32:20.698
You pronounced it in an old-fashioned way.

835
00:32:20.698 --> 00:32:22.168
I haven't heard it in a while.

836
00:32:22.168 --> 00:32:25.637
However, I took it out of my bag.

837
00:32:25.637 --> 00:32:28.837
I had moved recently.

838
00:32:29.268 --> 00:32:30.978
They sell a small toolkit...

839
00:32:30.978 --> 00:32:33.648
- at a mart. - You had it.

840
00:32:33.648 --> 00:32:36.178
- Thank goodness you are here. - Why do you say that?

841
00:32:36.178 --> 00:32:39.077
Now that you talked about it on TV, people will know that...

842
00:32:39.077 --> 00:32:40.847
it's a part of your personality.

843
00:32:41.047 --> 00:32:45.057
Given the character you played, carrying hammers and knives...

844
00:32:45.057 --> 00:32:47.158
is very scary.

845
00:32:47.158 --> 00:32:49.627
That must be why people talked at the security checkpoint.

846
00:32:49.627 --> 00:32:51.728
Bo Reum is not only good at dance,

847
00:32:51.728 --> 00:32:53.998
but also with bowling and longboard.

848
00:32:53.998 --> 00:32:55.668
- Longboard? - Yes.

849
00:32:55.698 --> 00:32:58.398
I often ride the longboard.

850
00:32:58.398 --> 00:33:01.968
I customized it to have a picture of my dog.

851
00:33:01.968 --> 00:33:03.377
Can you do the techniques?

852
00:33:03.377 --> 00:33:05.877
- I can do steps. - Really?

853
00:33:05.877 --> 00:33:07.577
- Do you dance on it? - Yes.

854
00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:11.047
I am sure you have talent,

855
00:33:11.047 --> 00:33:13.418
but your hobbies include everything that is fashionable.

856
00:33:13.617 --> 00:33:16.218
They are my hobbies of the past.

857
00:33:16.418 --> 00:33:17.857
Really? What do you do these days?

858
00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:21.787
I really like dogs.

859
00:33:21.787 --> 00:33:24.597
I got a dog groomer certification.

860
00:33:24.597 --> 00:33:25.958
- Did you get it? - Really?

861
00:33:26.367 --> 00:33:29.567
- There it is. - I got certification.

862
00:33:29.567 --> 00:33:31.268
Did you take a written test?

863
00:33:31.268 --> 00:33:33.337
I got a perfect score on it.

864
00:33:33.468 --> 00:33:36.978
You groom your dog.

865
00:33:36.978 --> 00:33:38.137
That's right.

866
00:33:38.137 --> 00:33:40.678
I also volunteer at animal shelters.

867
00:33:40.678 --> 00:33:44.317
Volunteers don't want to groom...

868
00:33:44.317 --> 00:33:47.787
big or scary dogs.

869
00:33:47.787 --> 00:33:50.117
- However, I love dogs so much... - That's right.

870
00:33:50.117 --> 00:33:51.587
that I take all ferocious dogs.

871
00:33:51.587 --> 00:33:53.688
When big dogs push,

872
00:33:53.688 --> 00:33:55.327
- they do it with force. - They are very powerful.

873
00:33:55.327 --> 00:33:57.857
How do you hold them? I have always been curious.

874
00:33:57.857 --> 00:34:01.768
Like you said, I find it hard to approach...

875
00:34:01.768 --> 00:34:05.398
- big and scary dogs. - That's right.

876
00:34:05.637 --> 00:34:08.438
It's important to stare the dog down.

877
00:34:08.438 --> 00:34:11.608
If you show that you are scared,

878
00:34:11.608 --> 00:34:12.978
the dog will look down on you.

879
00:34:13.248 --> 00:34:15.748
- You need to take control. - I need to take control...

880
00:34:15.878 --> 00:34:17.177
and build a connection.

881
00:34:17.177 --> 00:34:21.688
- "I will touch you, not hurt you." - That's not easy.

882
00:34:21.688 --> 00:34:25.057
I grab the scissors only after this process.

883
00:34:25.057 --> 00:34:27.688
You have love for the dogs.

884
00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:28.757
I love dogs.

885
00:34:28.757 --> 00:34:31.128
It helps her do her job well.

886
00:34:31.128 --> 00:34:33.228
I heard you have another hobby. You paint.

887
00:34:33.228 --> 00:34:36.128
- Do you have another hobby? - Yes, I love to paint.

888
00:34:36.128 --> 00:34:38.597
- She is a good artist. - That's my drawing.

889
00:34:38.798 --> 00:34:40.237
She has all sorts of tools at home.

890
00:34:40.237 --> 00:34:42.068
- Did you draw that? - Yes.

891
00:34:42.068 --> 00:34:43.278
Isn't that a picture?

892
00:34:43.338 --> 00:34:46.478
- I love cats and dogs. - How can she draw so well?

893
00:34:47.108 --> 00:34:49.108
- I usually draw animals. - You never learned it.

894
00:34:49.148 --> 00:34:52.217
I never learned it. I loved to draw as a child.

895
00:34:52.217 --> 00:34:54.217
- My goodness. - That's incredible.

896
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:57.418
She will succeed in any field.

897
00:34:57.958 --> 00:34:59.257
- Seriously. - How long does it take...

898
00:34:59.257 --> 00:35:00.487
to finish a drawing?

899
00:35:00.628 --> 00:35:02.588
It takes about a day.

900
00:35:02.588 --> 00:35:03.958
How did she draw that?

901
00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:05.657
One time, I was so absorbed with drawing...

902
00:35:05.657 --> 00:35:07.467
that I didn't leave the house for three days.

903
00:35:07.467 --> 00:35:10.338
You will need to stop working to keep up with your hobbies.

904
00:35:10.498 --> 00:35:11.768
When do you act?

905
00:35:11.768 --> 00:35:14.568
My agency told me to cut back on my hobbies.

906
00:35:14.568 --> 00:35:16.068
They told you that.

907
00:35:16.068 --> 00:35:20.007
When I debuted as an idol singer and failed,

908
00:35:20.148 --> 00:35:22.677
I bottled up everything. I didn't talk about my struggles.

909
00:35:22.677 --> 00:35:23.677
I see.

910
00:35:23.878 --> 00:35:27.048
- I began to lose hair. - Really?

911
00:35:27.048 --> 00:35:29.858
- My body reacted to the stress. - My goodness.

912
00:35:29.958 --> 00:35:32.487
It never went away.

913
00:35:32.487 --> 00:35:34.657
I lose hair every time I am stressed out.

914
00:35:34.858 --> 00:35:38.898
To be happy as an actress...

915
00:35:38.898 --> 00:35:41.228
- You thought about it. - I thought about it.

916
00:35:41.228 --> 00:35:43.898
Picking up hobbies...

917
00:35:44.068 --> 00:35:47.007
and learning and experiencing new things...

918
00:35:47.268 --> 00:35:51.338
make me happier in my free time.

919
00:35:51.338 --> 00:35:52.807
When I am in a drama,

920
00:35:52.807 --> 00:35:55.077
I become absorbed in it.

921
00:35:55.278 --> 00:35:58.947
I memorize the entire script.

922
00:35:59.048 --> 00:36:01.617
- You memorize every lines. - Yes. During the shoot,

923
00:36:01.947 --> 00:36:04.657
when someone asks, "Which scene came beforehand?"

924
00:36:04.657 --> 00:36:06.427
- I can tell him. - That's impressive.

925
00:36:06.427 --> 00:36:07.887
I become absorbed in it.

926
00:36:07.887 --> 00:36:09.657
- That's how I act. - Hyeon Gyeong doesn't do that.

927
00:36:09.657 --> 00:36:10.757
I only look at my lines.

928
00:36:11.458 --> 00:36:12.458
She is so different.

929
00:36:13.228 --> 00:36:15.498
- She is very different. - Yes, she is.

930
00:36:15.498 --> 00:36:18.998
Soo Kyung also learns many things.

931
00:36:19.137 --> 00:36:22.268
- However, it never lasts a month. - I like trying...

932
00:36:22.268 --> 00:36:25.677
a bit of everything as a hobby.

933
00:36:25.677 --> 00:36:29.548
Including myself, most people are like Soo Kyung.

934
00:36:30.048 --> 00:36:32.048
- We buy books to learn something. - Everyone does that.

935
00:36:32.048 --> 00:36:33.148
- I do that, too. - Me, too.

936
00:36:33.148 --> 00:36:34.588
That's right.

937
00:36:34.588 --> 00:36:38.787
- What did you learn before? - For a short amount of time,

938
00:36:38.787 --> 00:36:41.088
I learned taekkyeon before.

939
00:36:41.628 --> 00:36:43.657
Would you give us a demonstration?

940
00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:45.427
(She gave a demonstration without refusing.)

941
00:36:45.427 --> 00:36:48.568
Directors at private academies love people like her.

942
00:36:48.867 --> 00:36:51.168
- She never refuses. - She never refuses.

943
00:36:51.168 --> 00:36:52.637
- Seriously. - Pansori.

944
00:36:52.637 --> 00:36:54.237
Let's hear a bit of pansori.

945
00:36:54.237 --> 00:36:55.967
- Right now... - For how long have you learned it?

946
00:36:55.967 --> 00:36:58.378
- Do it like this. - Sing a bit of it.

947
00:36:58.778 --> 00:37:00.378
(Disheveled hair)

948
00:37:00.378 --> 00:37:01.407
Sing a bit of it.

949
00:37:02.347 --> 00:37:05.318
(Disheveled hair)

950
00:37:05.318 --> 00:37:06.818
Was it okay?

951
00:37:06.947 --> 00:37:09.487
Hyeon Gyeong, why don't you give it a go?

952
00:37:10.358 --> 00:37:11.717
(It sounds similar.)

953
00:37:11.717 --> 00:37:12.717
Bo Reum.

954
00:37:12.987 --> 00:37:14.987
Disheveled hair

955
00:37:14.987 --> 00:37:17.358
- She is good. - What was that?

956
00:37:17.358 --> 00:37:19.498
- What was that? - What was that?

957
00:37:19.498 --> 00:37:21.867
Soo Kyung is taking a loss after a loss.

958
00:37:21.998 --> 00:37:23.568
Soo Kyung.

959
00:37:23.568 --> 00:37:26.867
She is getting attacked left and right.

960
00:37:26.867 --> 00:37:28.708
She can't beat anyone.

961
00:37:28.967 --> 00:37:31.478
- Bo Reum is a great singer. - Soo Kyung is getting attacked...

962
00:37:31.478 --> 00:37:33.507
- left and right. - She is good.

963
00:37:33.507 --> 00:37:35.148
- She didn't learn it. - She is good.

964
00:37:35.148 --> 00:37:37.177
Se Jeong, give it a go.

965
00:37:37.177 --> 00:37:39.648
- You are a singer. - I am a bit nervous.

966
00:37:40.018 --> 00:37:41.048
(No way.)

967
00:37:43.358 --> 00:37:44.757
(Skilled)

968
00:37:45.588 --> 00:37:46.588
(She takes 2 losses.)

969
00:37:46.987 --> 00:37:48.427
Are you attacking her, too?

970
00:37:48.688 --> 00:37:51.197
- She attacked her. - Stop doing that.

971
00:37:51.257 --> 00:37:54.367
Please don't say,

972
00:37:54.367 --> 00:37:57.367
"I haven't done this before."

973
00:37:57.737 --> 00:37:59.168
Just say you have done it many times.

974
00:37:59.168 --> 00:38:00.268
Seriously.

975
00:38:00.268 --> 00:38:02.367
Just say you have done it many times.

976
00:38:02.367 --> 00:38:04.737
Soo Kyung is disheartened.

977
00:38:04.737 --> 00:38:05.907
- Let's hear it from Hae Sun. - Hae Sun.

978
00:38:05.907 --> 00:38:07.978
- Please sing '"Disheveled Hair". - She is a musical singer.

979
00:38:07.978 --> 00:38:11.478
- I am not good at pansori. - You still have singing skills.

980
00:38:11.947 --> 00:38:12.987
(Changing)

981
00:38:12.987 --> 00:38:14.947
(She is a great pansori singer.)

982
00:38:16.487 --> 00:38:18.217
She is a great pansori singer!

983
00:38:18.487 --> 00:38:19.757
(Soo Kyung loses again.)

984
00:38:20.688 --> 00:38:21.887
I can't believe you.

985
00:38:22.128 --> 00:38:23.798
You are so cruel.

986
00:38:23.798 --> 00:38:26.498
She is a great pansori singer!

987
00:38:26.498 --> 00:38:29.268
I knew from the moment she danced.

988
00:38:29.498 --> 00:38:31.068
She is annoying.

989
00:38:31.568 --> 00:38:34.068
You are attacking me a lot today.

990
00:38:34.608 --> 00:38:35.867
Seriously.

991
00:38:36.168 --> 00:38:37.637
This is hilarious.

992
00:38:37.637 --> 00:38:39.177
(Their chemistry earns them 2 episodes.)

993
00:38:39.177 --> 00:38:41.248
(Along with the Queens, Part 2)

994
00:38:42.148 --> 00:38:45.847
The queens are here. I will be upset of you change the channel.

995
00:38:47.217 --> 00:38:48.918
- How cute! - How cute!

996
00:38:49.117 --> 00:38:51.358
(The most popular singers from each genre are here.)

997
00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:55.228
(She won't count her songs...)

998
00:38:55.228 --> 00:38:56.228
(from her former group.)

999
00:38:56.228 --> 00:38:57.298
(Because she is a trendsetter.)

1000
00:38:58.028 --> 00:38:59.358
(To get more air time,)

1001
00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:01.498
(Strategist Hwang decided to exclude "Pick Me".)

1002
00:39:01.628 --> 00:39:03.367
- That's right! - Wheesung said...

1003
00:39:03.498 --> 00:39:06.367
(Wheesung wanted to include songs he wrote lyrics and melodies too.)

1004
00:39:06.367 --> 00:39:08.768
(However, it wasn't allowed.)

1005
00:39:09.168 --> 00:39:11.007
- Try to talk to him. - That's not allowed.

1006
00:39:11.007 --> 00:39:12.077
Wait, they are singing "Gashina".

1007
00:39:12.077 --> 00:39:15.048
(No way.)

1008
00:39:15.048 --> 00:39:16.248
("Gashina")

1009
00:39:16.248 --> 00:39:18.418
(Here's another song of our guest!)

1010
00:39:18.918 --> 00:39:20.918
(The men are in trouble.)

1011
00:39:21.548 --> 00:39:22.987
(Daniel makes a serious remark.)

1012
00:39:23.557 --> 00:39:24.657
We decided to include "Pick Me".

1013
00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:26.787
(They are the most competitive.)

1014
00:39:26.958 --> 00:39:28.128
- They are not singing our song. - You should include "Pick Me".

1015
00:39:28.128 --> 00:39:30.157
(How will Daniel's plan end?)

1016
00:39:30.157 --> 00:39:33.967
There's a ranking list of our guests' songs.

1017
00:39:33.967 --> 00:39:35.697
It's about popular songs at karaoke.

1018
00:39:35.697 --> 00:39:38.467
The list almost matches the order of guests getting off work today.

1019
00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:39.637
- That's right. - Yes, indeed.

1020
00:39:39.637 --> 00:39:41.268
When I introduce the songs,

1021
00:39:41.268 --> 00:39:44.708
you guys can sing a snippet of the songs.

1022
00:39:45.037 --> 00:39:47.077
- Here we go. - It's the chart of popular songs.

1023
00:39:47.077 --> 00:39:48.878
48th place goes to Sun Mi's "Gashina".

1024
00:39:48.878 --> 00:39:50.947
(48th place, "Gashina" by Sun Mi)

1025
00:39:50.947 --> 00:39:52.987
(What?)

1026
00:39:52.987 --> 00:39:54.188
Don't sing that part. Sing the chorus.

1027
00:39:54.188 --> 00:39:56.287
(She gets engrossed in her own song.)

1028
00:39:56.287 --> 00:39:58.358
- It's frustrating. - Where are you going, leaving me?

1029
00:40:00.387 --> 00:40:02.157
Sun Mi, it was more than a snippet.

1030
00:40:02.728 --> 00:40:04.927
- We must keep things short. - It's because...

1031
00:40:04.927 --> 00:40:06.628
- she got excited. - So why don't I...

1032
00:40:06.628 --> 00:40:08.327
- I got excited. - clear this up for others.

1033
00:40:08.327 --> 00:40:09.798
If the chosen song is "Gashina",

1034
00:40:09.798 --> 00:40:12.467
just sing, "Why are you leaving me?" Only sing the chorus, please.

1035
00:40:12.467 --> 00:40:15.367
59th place of the Popular Song Chart goes to Wanna One's "Energetic".

1036
00:40:15.367 --> 00:40:16.478
("Energetic" by Wanna One)

1037
00:40:16.478 --> 00:40:18.577
(I'm drawn to you even more)

1038
00:40:18.577 --> 00:40:19.577
(Pull me close)

1039
00:40:19.577 --> 00:40:20.847
- Why are you singing that part? - That's too long.

1040
00:40:20.847 --> 00:40:23.148
- He said not to sing for long. - You can't do that.

1041
00:40:23.148 --> 00:40:25.878
- It will be like "Music Bank". - Okay.

1042
00:40:25.878 --> 00:40:26.918
Let's try this again.

1043
00:40:26.918 --> 00:40:29.487
59th place goes to Wanna One's "Energetic".

1044
00:40:30.057 --> 00:40:31.787
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - You should just...

1045
00:40:32.057 --> 00:40:33.987
- I'm feeling so energetic - I'm feeling so energetic

1046
00:40:33.987 --> 00:40:35.987
- That's great. I like it. - This is it.

1047
00:40:36.157 --> 00:40:38.157
But you can't count in the beginning.

1048
00:40:38.697 --> 00:40:40.728
- They can't start at the same time. - My goodness.

1049
00:40:40.728 --> 00:40:42.697
- They must start right away. - Try to communicate with your eyes.

1050
00:40:42.697 --> 00:40:45.298
- That's how it is on "Music Bank". - They must work together.

1051
00:40:45.298 --> 00:40:47.668
- Sun Mi, let's start again. Sorry. - Let's do it again.

1052
00:40:47.668 --> 00:40:49.068
- Hey. - "Why are you leaving me behind?"

1053
00:40:49.068 --> 00:40:51.077
Why is this so important?

1054
00:40:51.077 --> 00:40:53.407
- It's the highlight of the show. - Why is this so important?

1055
00:40:53.407 --> 00:40:55.248
- Jae Seok cherishes... - Right.

1056
00:40:55.248 --> 00:40:57.378
- this segment the most. - This is my segment.

1057
00:40:57.378 --> 00:41:00.048
- This segment is so valuable. - This is for his own benefit.

1058
00:41:00.048 --> 00:41:01.487
- You come here for this segment. - That's right.

1059
00:41:01.487 --> 00:41:03.358
- This is the most important to me. - Fine.

1060
00:41:03.358 --> 00:41:04.987
- All right. Here we go again. - Let's just play along.

1061
00:41:04.987 --> 00:41:06.858
48th place goes to Sun Mi's "Gashina".

1062

1064
00:41:11.898 --> 00:41:13.697

1065
00:41:13.697 --> 00:41:14.967

1069
00:41:22.307 --> 00:41:25.108
- This was the best so far. - This is what I'm talking about.

1070
00:41:25.108 --> 00:41:27.177
- That was so awesome. - Isn't this amazing?

1071
00:41:27.748 --> 00:41:29.208
This is how it must be done.

1072
00:41:29.208 --> 00:41:31.018
- Let's see Rhythm and Blues Chart. - What should we do?

1073
00:41:31.018 --> 00:41:33.787
28th place goes to Wheesung's "Love... That Cruel Disease".

1082
00:41:53.438 --> 00:41:54.507
(He has their complete trust.)

1083
00:41:54.507 --> 00:41:57.438
- Only his songs were on the chart. - He owned that chart.

1084
00:41:57.438 --> 00:42:00.307
- We'll check out dance songs now. - Let's check the chart.

1093
00:42:17.057 --> 00:42:18.157
(I'm pretty, right?)

1094
00:42:19.028 --> 00:42:21.168
(They made the segment entertaining!)

1095
00:42:21.168 --> 00:42:22.168
Wasn't that great?

1096
00:42:22.168 --> 00:42:23.197
(Jae Seok's foresight...)

1097
00:42:23.197 --> 00:42:25.798
Now, I get why Jae Seok cherishes this segment.

1098
00:42:25.798 --> 00:42:27.467
- This is so fun. - Listening to the songs was fun.

1099
00:42:27.467 --> 00:42:29.907
- It was fun, wasn't it? Great. - I agree.

1100
00:42:29.907 --> 00:42:32.978
I heard Jae Hwan sang Wheesung's songs when he was in school.

1101
00:42:32.978 --> 00:42:35.307
- Yes! - "Yes"?

1102
00:42:35.307 --> 00:42:37.748
- He got his confidence back. - Yes!

1103
00:42:37.748 --> 00:42:39.617
- Which songs did you sing often? - How was the tempo of the song?

1104
00:42:39.617 --> 00:42:41.648
Actually, there was a time...

1105
00:42:41.648 --> 00:42:44.387
- that I entered a high school. - Okay.

1106
00:42:44.387 --> 00:42:45.787
"There was a time he entered a high school."

1107
00:42:45.787 --> 00:42:48.188
- I did too! - So what happened next?

1108
00:42:48.188 --> 00:42:49.958
- Good for you. - That must have been hard.

1109
00:42:49.958 --> 00:42:51.998
So when I was in school,

1110
00:42:51.998 --> 00:42:54.827
Wheesung was like a legend.

1111
00:42:55.097 --> 00:42:56.298
(To aspiring singers, he is like a legend.)

1112
00:42:56.298 --> 00:42:57.597
- He used a hard word. - Park Hyo Shin was one too.

1113
00:42:57.597 --> 00:42:59.467
- All right. Tell them. - Both of them were legends.

1114
00:42:59.467 --> 00:43:01.338
- Wasn't "Wit Me" famous? - He really likes this.

1115
00:43:01.338 --> 00:43:03.708
- I sang it because I liked it. - Savor this moment.

1116
00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:05.677
Jae Hwan, could you sing a snippet of the song, please?

1117
00:43:06.037 --> 00:43:07.177
- Should we sing it together? - He's leaning forward.

1118
00:43:07.177 --> 00:43:08.208
- Really? - Why don't you...

1119
00:43:08.208 --> 00:43:09.847
- Should we sing it together? - He's leaning forward.

1120
00:43:09.847 --> 00:43:12.577
- Why don't you sing with him? - This is so nice.

1121
00:43:12.577 --> 00:43:14.518
- Sing the song together. - But Wheesung,

1122
00:43:14.518 --> 00:43:16.188
now that a junior singer is going to sing your song,

1123
00:43:16.188 --> 00:43:19.018
- you're on the end of your chair. - He's really happy now.

1124
00:43:19.018 --> 00:43:21.028
- He seems truly happy. - Please sing the song for us.

1125
00:43:22.257 --> 00:43:25.927
("With Me" by Wheesung)

1126
00:43:27.228 --> 00:43:29.568
(The legendary singer starts the song with his sweet voice.)

1127
00:43:33.737 --> 00:43:35.268
- Wait. Hold on. - You'll sing the next measure.

1128
00:43:35.608 --> 00:43:38.278
(I thought you wanted to sing the song together.)

1129
00:43:38.278 --> 00:43:40.778
- He was going to sing the next one. - Hold on a second.

1130
00:43:40.778 --> 00:43:42.278
- You were supposed to alternate. - I seriously thought...

1131
00:43:42.278 --> 00:43:44.447
- This isn't "Immortal Songs". - I was mistaken.

1132
00:43:44.447 --> 00:43:46.617
- This was Jae Hwan's turn to sing. - You weren't supposed to do this.

1133
00:43:46.617 --> 00:43:48.887
- You were to sing it together. - Okay, okay. Let's do it again.

1134
00:43:48.887 --> 00:43:51.418
- I got it. Let's do this again. - Sing one line, and he sings next.

1135
00:43:51.418 --> 00:43:52.818
- Right. - Then you'll sing next.

1136
00:43:53.188 --> 00:43:55.487
- Hey, your jaw is about to drop. - Again. Let's do it again.

1137
00:43:55.487 --> 00:43:56.528
Gosh, he's so peculiar.

1138
00:43:56.757 --> 00:43:59.228
- Jae Hwan, do you want to sing 1st? - Then can I sing 1st?

1139
00:43:59.228 --> 00:44:00.898
- Okay, you should. - Thank you.

1140
00:44:00.898 --> 00:44:02.597
Tell us if you want to sing first.

1141
00:44:02.597 --> 00:44:04.268
- We have a lot to cover. - I like watching

1142
00:44:04.268 --> 00:44:05.898
(Jae Hwan sings "With Me" first.)

1143
00:44:05.898 --> 00:44:06.967
(You're doing great.)

1144
00:44:06.967 --> 00:44:08.438
- He's good. - He's doing great.

1145
00:44:08.737 --> 00:44:11.637
(Mellow voice)

1146
00:44:11.637 --> 00:44:13.478
- Gosh, he's a great singer. - Try harmonizing with him.

1147
00:44:13.847 --> 00:44:16.518
- Why don't you even - Why don't you even

1148
00:44:16.518 --> 00:44:17.717
- Why don't you even - Why don't you even

1149
00:44:17.717 --> 00:44:21.648
(The legendary singer harmonizes moderately.)

1150
00:44:22.418 --> 00:44:26.018
(They display the perfect teamwork.)

1151
00:44:28.088 --> 00:44:29.927
- You were so great! - This deserves a standing ovation.

1152
00:44:29.927 --> 00:44:32.798
- Hey, isn't he a good singer? - How wonderful.

1153
00:44:32.798 --> 00:44:35.197
You seem like a completely different person when you sing.

1154
00:44:35.197 --> 00:44:38.768
A little while ago, you looked like a singer who had been wronged.

1155
00:44:40.068 --> 00:44:42.708
- He's a different person. - He is an excellent singer.

1156
00:44:42.708 --> 00:44:44.708
- Indeed. You're amazing. - He's great. This is awesome.

1157
00:44:45.378 --> 00:44:47.278
- Gosh, he's great indeed. - You're quite the charmer.

1158
00:44:47.278 --> 00:44:49.278
- I agree. He has his own charms. - How charming.

1159
00:44:49.278 --> 00:44:50.347
Wheesung, what did you think?

1160
00:44:50.347 --> 00:44:53.688
- How did it feel? - Actually, he and I starred...

1161
00:44:53.688 --> 00:44:55.418
on "Immortal Songs" together.

1162
00:44:56.018 --> 00:45:00.757
(Jae Hwan sang "Goose Daddy" with all his heart.)

1163
00:45:01.458 --> 00:45:04.128
(He hit the high notes perfectly.)

1164
00:45:04.898 --> 00:45:07.197
When he sang on that day, everyone in the room flipped because...

1165
00:45:07.728 --> 00:45:09.768
- he was such a great singer. - Precisely.

1166
00:45:09.768 --> 00:45:11.998
Min Hyun, what kind of songs do you often sing at karaoke?

1167
00:45:11.998 --> 00:45:14.537
- I like ballad songs. - Such as?

1168
00:45:15.268 --> 00:45:17.307
- Which song do you sing? - I usually sing "Marry Me".

1169
00:45:17.307 --> 00:45:18.778
- "Marry Me". - I really love that song.

1170
00:45:19.407 --> 00:45:21.208
Could you sing the song for us?

1171
00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:22.447
- Right now? - Yes.

1172
00:45:22.947 --> 00:45:25.018
- Is it Maktub's song? - That's right.

1173
00:45:25.617 --> 00:45:28.188
Marry me

1174
00:45:28.188 --> 00:45:29.248
He's great.

1175
00:45:29.248 --> 00:45:32.057
(Would you hold my hand?)

1176
00:45:33.287 --> 00:45:35.157
(This is nice.)

1177
00:45:36.028 --> 00:45:39.458
(Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?)

1178
00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:41.498
(Yes! Let's do that!)

1179
00:45:41.498 --> 00:45:43.637
- That was phenomenal. - Hey, you are a great singer too!

1180
00:45:43.637 --> 00:45:45.537
- Everyone in the group sings well. - He sounded...

1181
00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:48.208
- very sweet. - His voice was similar to Maktub's.

1182
00:45:48.208 --> 00:45:49.507
- Exactly. - Seriously.

1183
00:45:49.507 --> 00:45:52.278
- Daniel, do you sing Heize's... - Sing it after Daniel.

1184
00:45:52.278 --> 00:45:54.608
- "You, Clouds, Rain" often? - You can go after Daniel.

1185
00:45:54.608 --> 00:45:57.217
I am a big fan of Heize.

1186
00:45:57.878 --> 00:46:01.287
It's been ages since I've been to karaoke, but I hum this song a lot.

1187
00:46:01.287 --> 00:46:03.188
Can you sing us a part of the song?

1188
00:46:04.657 --> 00:46:09.728
(Why don't we all enjoy his singing?)

1189
00:46:10.557 --> 00:46:15.268
I did it because I thought of you

1190
00:46:15.268 --> 00:46:17.398
It didn't mean anything

1191
00:46:18.237 --> 00:46:19.537
(His voice is divine indeed.)

1192
00:46:20.007 --> 00:46:22.168
- I rap, so I'm not that good. - He sings it differently.

1193
00:46:22.168 --> 00:46:23.878
- He's good. - It's a great song.

1194
00:46:23.878 --> 00:46:26.177
- Jae Hwan, you sang a bit before. - You have a great voice.

1195
00:46:26.177 --> 00:46:27.677
But which song do you sing often at karaoke?

1196
00:46:27.677 --> 00:46:29.048
- I... - Is there another one?

1197
00:46:29.447 --> 00:46:31.847
- "The Day We Met Again". - I love it.

1198
00:46:31.847 --> 00:46:33.918
- I used to practice the song a lot. - Is he happy again?

1199
00:46:33.918 --> 00:46:36.387
- Did that make you happy? - Yes, he feels happy now.

1200
00:46:36.387 --> 00:46:39.188
- I'm happy. It's a great song. - He has mood swings.

1201
00:46:40.157 --> 00:46:42.257
- Should we sing together? - "Should we sing together?"

1202
00:46:42.927 --> 00:46:43.927
Again?

1203
00:46:44.728 --> 00:46:46.827
(He warms up his voice.)

1204
00:46:46.827 --> 00:46:47.867
Let me start now.

1205
00:46:47.867 --> 00:46:48.927
(He's so adorable.)

1206
00:46:50.037 --> 00:46:52.197
(He gets serious.)

1207
00:46:55.867 --> 00:46:57.137
(He gets ready to harmonize.)

1208
00:47:00.148 --> 00:47:02.608
- It came out before I knew it - I knew it

1209
00:47:02.608 --> 00:47:06.518
(He adjusts the key in order to harmonize with Jae Hwan.)

1210
00:47:07.447 --> 00:47:08.748
(How nice.)

1211
00:47:10.987 --> 00:47:14.588
(He's engrossed in the song.)

1212
00:47:18.358 --> 00:47:20.528
- My gosh, they were great. - The harmony was great.

1213
00:47:20.528 --> 00:47:21.597
I love the harmony.

1214
00:47:21.597 --> 00:47:22.628
(Their chemistry explodes.)

1215
00:47:22.628 --> 00:47:24.268
- My goodness. - Wheesung can get off work now.

1216
00:47:24.268 --> 00:47:27.367
- She said he can get off work now. - What did she say?

1217
00:47:27.438 --> 00:47:30.577
- What kind of songs did you sing? - I just...

1218
00:47:30.577 --> 00:47:32.947
I sang songs like Ha.E.D's "Geenie".

1219
00:47:32.947 --> 00:47:35.447
- Geenie, when you're not with me - Geenie, when you're not with me

1220
00:47:35.447 --> 00:47:36.478
- Do you know the song? - Of course.

1221
00:47:36.478 --> 00:47:39.177
- Of course, we know. - I don't think they know.

1222
00:47:39.177 --> 00:47:40.487
- Do you not know the song? - Do you not know "Geenie"?

1223
00:47:40.487 --> 00:47:43.018
- The time is - It's my first time hearing it.

1224
00:47:43.688 --> 00:47:46.657
(It sounds like she's swearing.)

1225
00:47:46.657 --> 00:47:49.157
- I thought she was cursing. - Doesn't she sing like this?

1226
00:47:49.157 --> 00:47:52.257
- I thought she was swearing. - Her tone sounded like she was.

1227
00:47:52.358 --> 00:47:53.568
But that's how she sings, right?

1228
00:47:53.998 --> 00:47:55.398
(They are intrigued.)

1229
00:47:56.128 --> 00:47:57.597
Sing that part again.

1230
00:47:58.498 --> 00:48:00.737
(The time is passing)

1231
00:48:00.737 --> 00:48:02.268
That's how she sang it.

1232
00:48:02.268 --> 00:48:04.978
- I want to be your mystery - That's it.

1233
00:48:05.037 --> 00:48:06.478
She did sing just like that.

1234
00:48:06.478 --> 00:48:08.847
- Do you go to karaoke often? - I...

1235
00:48:08.847 --> 00:48:12.018
- Which song do you usually sing? - I like sentimental songs.

1236
00:48:12.018 --> 00:48:13.418
- Give us an example. - He's young,

1237
00:48:13.418 --> 00:48:15.548
- but he knows a lot of oldies. - Name a few songs.

1238
00:48:15.548 --> 00:48:16.787
I guess he likes old songs.

1239
00:48:16.787 --> 00:48:18.958
He knows most of the old ballad songs.

1240
00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:20.927
Name a song that you think can be considered really old.

1241
00:48:21.287 --> 00:48:22.998
(What's the oldest song he knows?)

1242
00:48:23.728 --> 00:48:26.628
(Everyone is curious to find out.)

1243
00:48:26.967 --> 00:48:28.367
(Glancing)

1244
00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:29.938
I'm not sure.

1245
00:48:29.938 --> 00:48:32.168
(I'm not sure.)

1246
00:48:33.168 --> 00:48:35.208
- He must've felt uncomfortable. - But the thing is that...

1247
00:48:35.208 --> 00:48:38.208
- he is very honest. - That's all right.

1248
00:48:38.407 --> 00:48:40.978
- Not that many people admit that. - He's so innocent.

1249
00:48:40.978 --> 00:48:43.617
- People don't say that often. - He's so young.

1250
00:48:43.617 --> 00:48:46.077
- His reply is quite refreshing. - Right.

1251
00:48:46.077 --> 00:48:49.657
- He's so innocent. - Wait. Min Hyun, what about you?

1252
00:48:49.657 --> 00:48:51.787
What's the oldest song you can think of?

1253
00:48:51.787 --> 00:48:54.628
Well, the old songs that I know are...

1254
00:48:54.628 --> 00:48:55.657
- Lee Moon Sae's songs. - I see.

1255
00:48:55.657 --> 00:48:56.728
Which song?

1256
00:48:56.898 --> 00:48:59.867
- "In the Shade of the Street Tree". - I know that song.

1257
00:48:59.867 --> 00:49:00.898
- "In the Shade of the Street Tree". - Yes.

1258
00:49:00.898 --> 00:49:02.628
- I'd consider that an old song. - That's a great song.

1259
00:49:02.628 --> 00:49:03.898
- Daniel. - Daniel.

1260
00:49:03.898 --> 00:49:04.938
"Me to You, You to Me".

1261
00:49:04.938 --> 00:49:05.967
("Me to You, You to Me" came out in 2001.)

1262
00:49:05.967 --> 00:49:08.037
- Me to you - Scenery of Riding Bicycle.

1263
00:49:08.037 --> 00:49:09.438
Is that the oldest song you know?

1264
00:49:09.438 --> 00:49:11.077
- It's old for me. - I listened to it when I was young.

1265
00:49:11.177 --> 00:49:13.507
What's the oldest song you know, Soo Hong?

1266
00:49:13.507 --> 00:49:16.447
It's TAS' "Waiting Everyday".

1267
00:49:16.617 --> 00:49:17.778
Can you sing it for us?

1268
00:49:18.447 --> 00:49:20.248
Dark and murky

1269
00:49:20.248 --> 00:49:21.617
You are indeed dark.

1270
00:49:22.287 --> 00:49:24.487
I thought it was your theme song.

1271
00:49:26.117 --> 00:49:27.787
- Really. - My gosh.

1272
00:49:27.787 --> 00:49:29.798
I thought it was your theme song.

1273
00:49:29.798 --> 00:49:32.228
- You surprised me. - Why did he sing that?

1274
00:49:32.228 --> 00:49:33.228
All right.

1275
00:49:33.228 --> 00:49:36.637
Whatever Daniel does becomes an issue these days.

1276
00:49:36.637 --> 00:49:38.798
You shopping with your mother...

1277
00:49:38.798 --> 00:49:40.208
became an issue.

1278
00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:44.677
When I earn enough money,

1279
00:49:44.677 --> 00:49:47.148
I wanted to buy her a gift first.

1280
00:49:47.548 --> 00:49:48.947
So I did as soon as I could.

1281
00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:51.177
- He's such a sweet son. - What did you buy her?

1282
00:49:51.177 --> 00:49:52.918
I bought her clothes...

1283
00:49:52.918 --> 00:49:54.318
- and bags. - My goodness.

1284
00:49:54.318 --> 00:49:55.347
Goodness.

1285
00:49:55.347 --> 00:49:57.688
- He's a good son. - Soo Yong also went shopping.

1286
00:49:57.688 --> 00:49:59.987
But my mother buys me everything.

1287
00:50:01.088 --> 00:50:02.387
(He's still a baby son to her.)

1288
00:50:02.387 --> 00:50:04.398
- Does that make you happy? - Yes.

1289
00:50:04.458 --> 00:50:07.898
Instead of you buying a gift for your mother,

1290
00:50:07.898 --> 00:50:10.867
- your mother buys it for you. - Right.

1291
00:50:10.867 --> 00:50:11.967
He's such a sweet son.

1292
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.367
During the interview, Jin Young analyzed...

1293
00:50:14.367 --> 00:50:17.037
his team members' characters.

1294
00:50:17.737 --> 00:50:20.278
(Last week, he showed his ambition to join a variety show.)

1295
00:50:21.677 --> 00:50:22.918
(He was filled with ambition,)

1296
00:50:24.048 --> 00:50:25.077
Start.

1297
00:50:25.077 --> 00:50:27.617
(but he ended up just acting very cute.)

1298
00:50:28.287 --> 00:50:29.757
(Will today go as Jin Young planned?)

1299
00:50:29.757 --> 00:50:31.287
Tell us about Daniel.

1300
00:50:31.287 --> 00:50:34.827
Daniel looks reassuring on the outside,

1301
00:50:34.827 --> 00:50:37.228
but he's actually like an elementary school kid.

1302
00:50:37.228 --> 00:50:38.298
He's an elementary school kid.

1303
00:50:38.298 --> 00:50:40.528
It's very easy to make him laugh.

1304
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:44.237
- What does he mean? - He laughs about anything.

1305
00:50:44.237 --> 00:50:45.438
So he laughs about anything.

1306
00:50:45.438 --> 00:50:46.938
He laughs about something that's not even very funny.

1307
00:50:46.938 --> 00:50:48.367
(Daniel always laughs.)

1308
00:50:48.537 --> 00:50:51.378
Overall, he acts like an elementary school student.

1309
00:50:51.378 --> 00:50:53.307
Yes. Daniel...

1310
00:50:53.548 --> 00:50:55.778
and I don't laugh at the same jokes.

1311
00:50:56.548 --> 00:50:57.978
So he laughs alone.

1312
00:50:58.248 --> 00:50:59.617
Does he laugh alone?

1313
00:50:59.918 --> 00:51:01.188
He laughs alone.

1314
00:51:01.188 --> 00:51:02.818
He's laughing even when I don't find it funny.

1315
00:51:02.818 --> 00:51:03.858
(He can't understand him.)

1316
00:51:03.858 --> 00:51:05.418
When he laughs, I don't laugh.

1317
00:51:05.418 --> 00:51:06.887
So you laugh at different jokes.

1318
00:51:07.728 --> 00:51:09.088
How about Min Hyun?

1319
00:51:09.088 --> 00:51:13.168
Min Hyun and I became a lot closer...

1320
00:51:13.168 --> 00:51:14.568
these days.

1321
00:51:15.367 --> 00:51:16.537
And sometimes he overdoes things.

1322
00:51:18.597 --> 00:51:19.807
- I... - How so?

1323
00:51:19.807 --> 00:51:21.568
I am very touchy.

1324
00:51:21.568 --> 00:51:23.507
I am very touchy with these guys.

1325
00:51:24.108 --> 00:51:26.648
I think he is adorable.

1326
00:51:26.648 --> 00:51:28.378
- You kept patting him. - Right.

1327
00:51:28.378 --> 00:51:30.177
I do it because I think he's cute, and he seems to not like it.

1328
00:51:30.748 --> 00:51:33.617
Sometimes, he sends me kisses.

1329
00:51:33.947 --> 00:51:35.947
- Does he? - It's my way of showing affection.

1330
00:51:36.088 --> 00:51:38.387
- How do you do it? - Show them.

1331
00:51:39.458 --> 00:51:41.057
(He's such a lovely man.)

1332
00:51:41.057 --> 00:51:42.128
He should face the camera.

1333
00:51:42.128 --> 00:51:43.998
I can't believe he does it to other men.

1334
00:51:43.998 --> 00:51:45.998
See? They are...

1335
00:51:45.998 --> 00:51:47.867
(Yong Man sends Jae Seok his kiss.)

1336
00:51:48.427 --> 00:51:49.737
What kind of a person is Jae Hwan?

1337
00:51:49.798 --> 00:51:52.398
Jae Hwan is a little old-fashioned.

1338
00:51:53.237 --> 00:51:54.237
Old-fashioned?

1339
00:51:54.708 --> 00:51:56.978
In what ways? How is he old-fashioned?

1340
00:51:56.978 --> 00:51:59.007
How should I say this?

1341
00:51:59.007 --> 00:52:01.108
- He acts like a school principal. - A school principal.

1342
00:52:02.708 --> 00:52:04.318
Does he give you lessons?

1343
00:52:04.318 --> 00:52:05.518
(Principal Kim Jae Hwan)

1344
00:52:05.518 --> 00:52:07.748
I get what he means.

1345
00:52:07.748 --> 00:52:10.418
He talks like this. "That is..."

1346
00:52:10.418 --> 00:52:12.318
He rests between words.

1347
00:52:12.318 --> 00:52:13.327
My goodness.

1348
00:52:13.327 --> 00:52:15.528
Jin Young is good.

1349
00:52:15.528 --> 00:52:16.597
(He's a rising variety show star.)

1350
00:52:16.628 --> 00:52:19.827
Jae Hwan, what do you think of Jin Young?

1351
00:52:19.827 --> 00:52:21.927
We often describe his actions...

1352
00:52:21.927 --> 00:52:24.197
as mutiny.

1353
00:52:24.367 --> 00:52:26.037
(Jae Hwan counterattacks.)

1354
00:52:26.438 --> 00:52:27.608
That's very strong.

1355
00:52:28.037 --> 00:52:29.708
- So... - That's very strong.

1356
00:52:29.708 --> 00:52:31.407
He treats us very comfortably,

1357
00:52:31.407 --> 00:52:32.978
although he's much younger than us.

1358
00:52:33.577 --> 00:52:35.748
So he's like Jae Seok among us.

1359
00:52:36.318 --> 00:52:37.378
Really?

1360
00:52:37.378 --> 00:52:39.177
Do you tell them your honest opinions?

1361
00:52:39.177 --> 00:52:40.518
He's honest.

1362
00:52:41.217 --> 00:52:42.987
These guys are older than me,

1363
00:52:42.987 --> 00:52:46.018
- but I treat them like my friends. - We are friends.

1364
00:52:46.018 --> 00:52:47.157
We didn't give him permission.

1365
00:52:47.157 --> 00:52:48.688
He's the only person who thinks we're friends.

1366
00:52:49.057 --> 00:52:50.528
We never gave him permission.

1367
00:52:50.528 --> 00:52:52.628
It's the same for Jin Young, isn't it?

1368
00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:54.867
- He's like Jae Seok. - I know.

1369
00:52:54.867 --> 00:52:56.467
Who's the most awkward person in the group?

1370
00:52:56.467 --> 00:52:57.838
With whom do you feel awkward?

1371
00:52:57.838 --> 00:52:59.168
Let's say you're alone with him.

1372
00:52:59.168 --> 00:53:01.807
I don't feel awkward with anybody.

1373
00:53:01.807 --> 00:53:03.878
But I can't talk to Ji Sung for a long time.

1374
00:53:04.507 --> 00:53:06.137
Ji Sung.

1375
00:53:07.708 --> 00:53:09.378
(I can't believe this.)

1376
00:53:10.148 --> 00:53:12.518
I suddenly miss Ji Sung.

1377
00:53:12.518 --> 00:53:14.518
How's Ji Sung? How is he?

1378
00:53:14.518 --> 00:53:16.018
He's still very bubbly.

1379
00:53:16.018 --> 00:53:17.117
He's still very bubbly.

1380
00:53:17.358 --> 00:53:20.057
But he wouldn't be too quiet. He would talk a lot.

1381
00:53:20.057 --> 00:53:21.887
- He talks a lot. - Right.

1382
00:53:21.958 --> 00:53:24.097
And there's a big generation gap.

1383
00:53:25.798 --> 00:53:27.728
He's very straightforward.

1384
00:53:28.298 --> 00:53:29.298
He's amazing.

1385
00:53:29.367 --> 00:53:31.097
He said some important things.

1386
00:53:31.097 --> 00:53:32.398
He talks slowly yet honestly.

1387
00:53:32.398 --> 00:53:34.237
The other members have gone completely quiet.

1388
00:53:34.237 --> 00:53:36.708
Daniel seems to sympathize with him.

1389
00:53:36.708 --> 00:53:38.838
What he said about Ji Sung is true.

1390
00:53:38.838 --> 00:53:40.847
Ji Sung get along well with us.

1391
00:53:40.847 --> 00:53:41.907
- Yes. - Yes.

1392
00:53:41.907 --> 00:53:44.418
- We got along very well. - He knew everything we know.

1393
00:53:44.418 --> 00:53:47.847
He's the only bridge that connects us with Wanna One.

1394
00:53:47.847 --> 00:53:51.487
When Ji Sung says something, I pretend to understand.

1395
00:53:51.487 --> 00:53:52.688
Then I search about it.

1396
00:53:54.128 --> 00:53:55.327
(He's very funny.)

1397
00:53:55.887 --> 00:53:58.358
He talks like an old man.

1398
00:53:58.358 --> 00:54:00.898
And the day after, I pretend to know what he's talking about.

1399
00:54:00.898 --> 00:54:04.298
What did you recently search about?

1400
00:54:04.298 --> 00:54:06.307
- He mentioned about Serengeti. - Serengeti.

1401
00:54:06.307 --> 00:54:07.637
- I didn't know what it was. - You don't know it?

1402
00:54:07.637 --> 00:54:10.007
- It's a park in Africa. - I found out...

1403
00:54:10.007 --> 00:54:11.637
- that it's a national park. - It's a national park.

1404
00:54:11.637 --> 00:54:14.077
It's very interesting.

1405
00:54:14.077 --> 00:54:15.708
This is Jin Young's...

1406
00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:17.548
first time to be on public TV.

1407
00:54:17.548 --> 00:54:19.717
Because he doesn't have experience, he's got that rawness.

1408
00:54:19.717 --> 00:54:20.748
I know.

1409
00:54:21.847 --> 00:54:24.088
- He's fresh. - His words are unfiltered.

1410
00:54:24.088 --> 00:54:25.818
It's like seeing a conveyor belt sushi.

1411
00:54:25.818 --> 00:54:28.557
- What? - Very fresh.

1412
00:54:28.827 --> 00:54:30.228
Why did you mention that all of a sudden?

1413
00:54:30.228 --> 00:54:31.628
I am craving for sushi.

1414
00:54:33.298 --> 00:54:35.197
Now, to win the chance card,

1415
00:54:35.197 --> 00:54:36.898
the singers will have a singing competition.

1416
00:54:36.898 --> 00:54:38.697
Wheesung, do you want to start?

1417
00:54:38.697 --> 00:54:40.537
Yes.

1418
00:54:40.537 --> 00:54:43.007
What will you sing, Wheesung?

1419
00:54:43.007 --> 00:54:44.978
I will sing Primary's "See Through".

1420
00:54:44.978 --> 00:54:45.978
("See Through" by Primary)

1421
00:54:45.978 --> 00:54:47.278
This song is really nice.

1422
00:54:47.548 --> 00:54:49.007
- "See Through". - It's a very nice song.

1423
00:54:49.007 --> 00:54:51.148
I think you're just trying to get a high score.

1424
00:54:51.548 --> 00:54:53.418
You were going to sing a ballad.

1425
00:54:53.418 --> 00:54:55.617
I'm told I can't get a high score with a ballad song.

1426
00:54:55.617 --> 00:54:57.018
- Wheesung. - Yes.

1427
00:54:57.018 --> 00:54:58.018
Please begin.

1428
00:54:58.487 --> 00:55:05.798
(How would Wheesung sing Primary's "See Through"?)

1429

1430
00:55:30.617 --> 00:55:32.217
(He enjoys the groove.)

1431
00:55:42.298 --> 00:55:46.168
("See Through" became more colorful with Wheesung.)

1432
00:55:46.907 --> 00:55:48.967
(What score did he get?)

1433
00:55:48.967 --> 00:55:50.507
(He got 90.)

1434
00:55:50.507 --> 00:55:51.507
90.

1435
00:55:51.637 --> 00:55:53.548
- That's very high. - That's high.

1436
00:55:53.548 --> 00:55:54.548
That's considered very high.

1437
00:55:54.548 --> 00:55:55.608
That's very high.

1438
00:55:55.878 --> 00:55:57.117
He plays with the rhythm.

1439
00:55:57.117 --> 00:55:58.148
(He controlled the rhythm freely.)

1440
00:55:58.148 --> 00:55:59.947
- He's amazing. - He did everything by himself...

1441
00:55:59.947 --> 00:56:01.447
including rapping.

1442
00:56:01.447 --> 00:56:02.588
He did.

1443
00:56:03.117 --> 00:56:06.657
The next person must feel the pressure.

1444
00:56:06.657 --> 00:56:08.528
- Is it Sun Mi next? - Sun Mi.

1445
00:56:08.528 --> 00:56:10.427
(Sun Mi is next.)

1446
00:56:10.427 --> 00:56:12.927
I will sing Twice' "Cheer Up".

1447
00:56:13.568 --> 00:56:14.628
- Goodness. - This is nice.

1448
00:56:17.568 --> 00:56:19.768
(Sun Mi will play all 9 roles.)

1449
00:56:41.787 --> 00:56:46.327
(She's very relaxed.)

1450
00:57:00.648 --> 00:57:03.318
(She's slightly having a hard time.)

1451
00:57:09.447 --> 00:57:11.418
(Are they soldiers?)

1452
00:57:12.358 --> 00:57:14.528
(Rise, 600,000 soldiers!)

1453
00:57:15.157 --> 00:57:16.998
(Come on, Sun Mi!)

1454
00:57:19.398 --> 00:57:20.568
(Cheer up!)

1455
00:57:21.298 --> 00:57:24.298
(She struggles.)

1456
00:57:25.168 --> 00:57:26.708
(He's struggling too.)

1457
00:57:26.708 --> 00:57:28.907
(I will act like nothing’s up)

1458
00:57:29.467 --> 00:57:30.708
(Laughing)

1459
00:57:32.037 --> 00:57:34.278
(She uses the remaining bit of energy...)

1460
00:57:34.278 --> 00:57:35.648
(and ends it.)

1461
00:57:36.518 --> 00:57:38.577
That was supposed to be sung by nine people.

1462
00:57:38.577 --> 00:57:39.847
Don't sing this ever again.

1463
00:57:39.847 --> 00:57:40.847
- She sang it alone. - She skipped a few bars.

1464
00:57:40.847 --> 00:57:42.418
- She did. - She skipped a few parts.

1465
00:57:42.418 --> 00:57:44.757
Right? She didn't sing a few parts.

1466
00:57:44.757 --> 00:57:45.787
- Hey! - She didn't.

1467
00:57:45.787 --> 00:57:47.958
You didn't sing a few parts.

1468
00:57:48.057 --> 00:57:49.188
(She got 77. So far, she's got the lowest score.)

1469
00:57:49.188 --> 00:57:50.458
She's suffering too much.

1470
00:57:50.728 --> 00:57:51.927
Sun Mi,

1471
00:57:51.927 --> 00:57:55.097
it's supposed to be sung by nine people.

1472
00:57:55.097 --> 00:57:57.068
- It's tough to sing it alone. - It's not easy.

1473
00:57:57.068 --> 00:57:58.697
- It's... - Will you go home now?

1474
00:58:00.108 --> 00:58:02.568
Will you go home after singing "Cheer Up"?

1475
00:58:02.568 --> 00:58:04.438
She's exhausted.

1476
00:58:04.577 --> 00:58:06.648
- All right, everyone. - Who's next?

1477
00:58:06.648 --> 00:58:07.978
Wheesung is currently winning with the score of 90.

1478
00:58:07.978 --> 00:58:10.248
Next is Jin Young.

1479
00:58:10.248 --> 00:58:12.518
(She's very confident.)

1480
00:58:12.717 --> 00:58:14.918
- Koyote's "Pure Love". - This song is exciting.

1481
00:58:14.918 --> 00:58:16.487
Koyote's "Pure Love".

1482
00:58:16.487 --> 00:58:18.287
- This is... - Koyote?

1483
00:58:19.679 --> 00:58:21.349
- She chose... - This is an upbeat song.

1484
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:23.449
- an upbeat song. I knew it. - It suits her.

1485
00:58:23.949 --> 00:58:25.949
- She's true to her reputation. - All right. Thanks for joining us.

1486
00:58:25.949 --> 00:58:27.489
(The Master of Performing at Events)

1487
00:58:27.489 --> 00:58:30.619
It's nice to meet all of you here on Happy Together today.

1488
00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:33.889
Everyone on Happy Together, scream!

1489
00:58:33.889 --> 00:58:34.989
(Screaming)

1490
00:58:35.389 --> 00:58:37.500
Scream one more time!

1491
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.500
(Screaming)

1492
00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:44.040
(Her performance hits home for the middle-aged men.)

1493
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.369
- You're great! - This is so fun.

1494
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.310
Gosh, she's so much fun. Seriously. This is great.

1495
00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:50.840
(She's a model example of an exciting show.)

1496
00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.880
This is great.

1497
00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:59.619
(She raises the key, which is great!)

1498
00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.090
Her voice sounds similar to Shin Ji's.

1499
00:59:12.759 --> 00:59:13.900
Great!

1500
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:18.500
(I want to hold onto you while begging)

1501
00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:20.239
You're doing great.

1502
00:59:20.739 --> 00:59:22.340
(Everyone,)

1503
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.880
(sing the chorus!)

1504

(It was the most exciting performance of all.)

1507
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:36.619
(What is the score of the performance?)

1508
00:59:36.619 --> 00:59:38.619
- What's the score? - I think it might be over 90.

1509
00:59:38.619 --> 00:59:40.290
- It's in the 70s? Hey, we won then! - My gosh.

1510
00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:42.360
- What just happened? - It's a 20-point difference.

1511
00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.460
(She is last.)

1512
00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.560
What? Why did she score so low?

1513
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.500
- This is unbelievable. - Let's just get second place.

1516

1517

1519

Third place is great too.

1520
00:59:56.469 --> 00:59:57.880
- Which song will Wanna One sing? - Their score is too high.

1521
00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.580
- We prepared to sing a ballad song, - This is hard. It really is.

1522
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.449
- Yoon Jong Shin's "Like It". - I see.

1523
01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:04.779
- We can't spoil this excitement, - That's right.

1524
01:00:04.779 --> 01:00:06.380
- so we changed to another song. - What is it?

1525
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.190
- They'll change at the last minute. - It's Blackpink's...

1526
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.489
- "Whistle". - "Whistle"? That's a great song.

1527
01:00:10.489 --> 01:00:11.889
(They'll sing "Whistle" by Blackpink.)

1528

- Whistle - Whistle

1529

(Our goal is getting the 2nd place!)

1530

(Wanna One's interpretation of "Whistle")

1531
01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:21.699
We're going to sing in its original key.

1532

(You can do this, Jae Hwan!)

1558
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:05.599
(- Do I keep singing? - Yes.)

1559

1577

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.860
- What a bummer. - Gosh, they are great singers.

1580
01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:02.429
So 1st place goes to Wheesung with 90 points.

1581
01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.099
2nd place goes to Wanna One with 89 points.

1582
01:03:05.099 --> 01:03:07.099
3rd place goes to Sun Mi with 77 points.

1583
01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:09.029
- It was only a point difference. - I can't believe she is in fourth.

1584
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:11.799
- The difference is a point. - How could Jin Young get 76?

1585
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.969
Shall I sing one more song?

1586
01:03:12.969 --> 01:03:14.310
No, no. That's all right.

1587
01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:16.569
(Pouty)

1588
01:03:16.569 --> 01:03:17.840
She did a great job though.

1589
01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.679
What time is it right now?

1590
01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.310
- It's 10 minutes before 6. - It's 5:50pm.

1591
01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:23.849
Are we going to start now?

1592
01:03:23.949 --> 01:03:26.480
- We are going to begin now. - Let's start already.

1593
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.020
Sing My Song!

1594
01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:32.219
- Let's see who will get off first. - We're in Hongdae.

1595
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.500
Here we go. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1596
01:03:37.599 --> 01:03:38.929
- It begins now! - All right!

1597
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.569
Okay.

1598
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:42.569
- Let's see how this plays out. - Let's observe first.

1599
01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:45.170
- Let's watch first. - If the customers sing any of...

1600
01:03:45.569 --> 01:03:48.440
- your songs, you can leave. - We can leave right away.

1601
01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.409
- We can get off work right away. - You may leave immediately.

1602
01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:51.779
- We'll be off work. - We have to use our chances.

1603
01:03:51.779 --> 01:03:55.179
Let's check what kind of songs the customers are singing now.

1604
01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:56.679
I see Park Hyo Shin's "Fool".

1605
01:03:56.679 --> 01:03:59.319
- They might sing Wheesung's song. - That's a possibility.

1606
01:03:59.319 --> 01:04:00.920
- They might sing my song too. - Right.

1607
01:04:00.949 --> 01:04:03.590
- Park Hyo Shin? - From my observation, I think...

1608
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:05.590
they like to sing ballad songs like Hyo Shin's.

1609
01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:08.290
- They are singing "Tears". - That's a given now.

1610
01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:11.330
- She could've gone home in 10. - But the thing is...

1611
01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:12.900
"Tears" is very popular.

1612
01:04:12.929 --> 01:04:16.099
- That's another song. - Chan Whee has the fastest record.

1613
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:17.670
Right, right. Let's check out Room Two.

1614
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.040
- It's "Like It" again. - They're singing "Like It".

1615
01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:24.279
"Like It" is loved beyond one's gender and age.

1616
01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:27.250
- It's the song of the year. - I agree.

1617
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.610
Let's check out Room Three.

1618
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:32.380
They sang Hyo Shin's song. They're done. They're leaving.

1619
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.750
- They didn't sing Wheesung's songs. - No.

1620
01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:36.389
- They could've sung Wheesung's. - They probably would've sung his.

1621
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.860
They could've sung Wheesung's, but they are leaving now.

1622
01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:41.330
- I want to add minutes for them. - All right.

1623
01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:45.000
- Now that we have started... - Did they sing it yet?

1624
01:04:45.159 --> 01:04:47.469
Jin Young told us that he wanted to stay here longer earlier,

1625
01:04:47.469 --> 01:04:50.739
but he is watching three of the rooms with utmost attention.

1626
01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:54.739
- He keeps watching carefully. - He watches with his sharp eyes.

1627
01:04:54.739 --> 01:04:56.170
- That's right. - They might sing my song.

1628
01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:58.509
- In the music video of... - New customers came in.

1629
01:04:58.509 --> 01:05:00.040
- Room Three, I see Wanna One. - That's right.

1630
01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.580
- but it's not Wanna One's song. - Hold on a second.

1631
01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.409
- Is their music video on? - That's their music video.

1632
01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:05.279
- Wait. That's... - Customers might be influenced.

1633
01:05:05.279 --> 01:05:06.880
- That might be an advantage. - You can't do that.

1634
01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.250
- Music videos are effective. - The owner plays music videos.

1635
01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:11.489
- What can we do about that? - Are they chosen randomly?

1636
01:05:11.489 --> 01:05:14.860
- Of course. - This could be a big advantage.

1637
01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.690
- They're pointing at the video. - Please.

1638
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.029
- What if they sing Wanna One's? - What if they sing it now?

1639
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:19.360
No, no. No way.

1640
01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.569
- Wait. - What if they're practicing now?

1641
01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:23.099
- They are all ladies, right? - Yes.

1642
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:25.199
- They are at the age where... - They are younger than Sun Mi.

1643
01:05:25.199 --> 01:05:27.099
- they like Wanna One. - Are they talking about Wanna One?

1644
01:05:27.099 --> 01:05:29.110
- Right. They were pointing at them. - Exactly. They did that.

1645
01:05:29.139 --> 01:05:30.710
I also think they might sing Wanna One's song.

1646
01:05:30.779 --> 01:05:34.349
- For some reason... - For some reason, I think...

1647
01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:36.810
- there could be a connection here. - Let's listen to the conversation.

1648
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.389
Are they the famous group?

1649
01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:45.319
- "Are they the famous group?" - "Are they the famous group?"

1650
01:05:45.319 --> 01:05:46.360
- They're talking about Wanna One. - Yes!

1651
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.830
- She was asking about Wanna One. - Please!

1652
01:05:48.889 --> 01:05:50.929
- "Energetic". - I think they're going to sing it.

1653
01:05:50.929 --> 01:05:52.599
- I have a good feeling about this. - So do I.

1654
01:05:52.599 --> 01:05:54.299
- No way. No way! - I think they're going to sing it.

1655
01:05:54.299 --> 01:05:57.369
- We just started the segment. - Hey, this is crazy.

1656
01:05:57.469 --> 01:06:00.469
- Please! - They kept talking about the video.

1657
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:03.710
- They are looking for it. - They are looking for the song.

1658
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.340
- Keep going. It's Sun Mi's. - "Like It".

1659
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.610
Sun Mi!

1660
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:12.779
(Will they sing "Gashina"?)

1661
01:06:12.779 --> 01:06:14.790
(Or will they sing Wanna One's song in the music video?)

1662
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:17.619
Sun Mi. It's Sun Mi's. Go down one more. Wait a second.

1663
01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.420
- "Blackpink's". - "Blackpink's".

1664
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.029
- "As If It's Your Last". - The one below was Sun Mi's.

1665
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.960
- The one below was Sun Mi's. - Yes, that was her song.

1666
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:26.830
It was only off by one.

1667
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:28.330
(The start button was pressed as if it was her last chance.)

1668
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:30.670
- That was so close. - My goodness.

1669
01:06:31.469 --> 01:06:32.599
But let us keep hoping.

1670
01:06:32.599 --> 01:06:34.040
Yes, keep your hopes up.

1671
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.009
We expected them to sing Wanna One's song since they were mentioned.

1672
01:06:37.139 --> 01:06:39.380
- Suddenly, it was Sun Mi's song. - It was Sun Mi's song.

1673
01:06:39.779 --> 01:06:41.310
- In the end, it wasn't. - The chance is gone.

1674
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:44.020
This segment keeps you on your toes.

1675
01:06:44.779 --> 01:06:47.319
- That's the fun of this segment. - This is quite thrilling.

1676
01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.619
- It is, isn't it? - Definitely.

1677
01:06:48.619 --> 01:06:50.619
My gosh, what a bummer.

1678
01:06:50.619 --> 01:06:52.889
- I didn't know, but Wheesung... - Right now...

1679
01:06:52.889 --> 01:06:55.929
listed over 200 songs in Korea Music Copyright Association.

1680
01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.830
- Is that true? - I have about 300 songs.

1681
01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:59.960
- 300 songs? - All of them are listed?

1682
01:07:00.159 --> 01:07:02.069
- You must get a lot of royalties. - There you go again.

1683
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:05.340
Well, yes. It's enough for me to get by even if I don't work.

1684
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:06.670
- You get it even if you don't work. - Yes.

1685
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:11.510
- You wrote a lot of songs so far. - That's a lot of money.

1686
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:13.640
Which song gives you the highest royalty?

1687
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.750
- Which one is it? - The song with the most royalty...

1688
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:20.380
was Youn Ha's "Password 486".

1689
01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.290
("Password 486" by Youn Ha)

1690
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:23.619
How did you write that song?

1691
01:07:23.619 --> 01:07:25.260
I thought it'd be "Heaven".

1692
01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.989
It's one of the songs I can't ever forget about.

1693
01:07:27.989 --> 01:07:32.330
I wrote the song two days before I started my service in the army.

1694
01:07:32.399 --> 01:07:35.600
I was working on Ailee's first album,

1695
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.840
but until the last moment, there wasn't a song I was satisfied with.

1696
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:42.869
Then I got the song two days before,

1697
01:07:42.869 --> 01:07:45.210
so I rushed to write the song,

1698
01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:47.040
arranged it on that day, recorded it the next day,

1699
01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.449
and I joined the army the next day.

1700
01:07:48.449 --> 01:07:50.819
- You rushed it. - Yes.

1701
01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:52.350
- That was a hit. - It became a hit.

1702
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:55.819
I didn't have any income during two years in the army,

1703
01:07:55.819 --> 01:07:58.460
- but "Heaven" made it up. - But that song.

1704
01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.260
It literally was a paradise for me.

1705
01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.790
It's a paradise for you.

1706
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.029
(He's proud.)

1707
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:05.659
- Let's check Room One. - We're good.

1708
01:08:05.659 --> 01:08:06.659
Room One.

1709
01:08:07.229 --> 01:08:09.330
("You're the One for Me" by Triptops)

1710
01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:10.330
Room Two.

1711
01:08:11.239 --> 01:08:14.140
("Embrace" by Sung Si Kyung)

1712
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:16.710
It's Room Three.

1713
01:08:17.409 --> 01:08:20.479
("I Want to Fall in Love" by Kim Jo Han)

1714
01:08:20.949 --> 01:08:22.010
Kim Jo Han.

1715
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.580
Put it down please.

1716
01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.649
- I have no idea. - It's all ballad.

1717
01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:27.189
I was expecting Wanna One's song in Room Three,

1718
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:30.019
but it's not going to the right direction.

1719
01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:33.390
This means it could be a long term.

1720
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:36.859
You need to watch the rooms carefully while talking.

1721
01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:38.029
We can't watch them all.

1722
01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.559
You must take care of yourselves.

1723
01:08:39.559 --> 01:08:42.369
Sun Mi can't take her eyes off.

1724
01:08:42.369 --> 01:08:43.630
I'm surprised.

1725
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:44.840
- Wheesung. - Yes.

1726
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.739
Did you just call your friends?

1727
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:49.109
- Were you checking time? - I checked time.

1728
01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:51.680
- You shouldn't text. - I'm getting nervous.

1729
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.210
- Don't call your friends to sing. - Are you doubting him?

1730
01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:55.609
We need to collect cellphones.

1731
01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:56.750
- He's just nervous. - I think Jin Young will...

1732
01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:57.880
- Are you just nervous? - go to the room with many people.

1733
01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.819
- I'm going to check all of you. - We're going to check you.

1734
01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:02.319
We can tell if they're your friends.

1735
01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:05.489
If they rush in to sing his song, it's 100 percent his friends.

1736
01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.029
Text them to say you got caught.

1737
01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:09.189
- We should check the cellphone. - It's obvious...

1738
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:11.330
if they start looking around as soon as they arrive.

1739
01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.630
- We can tell when we see them. - Yes.

1740
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:19.000
I heard Jae Hwan almost got into trouble because...

1741
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.300
he's jealous of Daniel's sexiness.

1742
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.109
What do you mean you almost got into trouble from copying him?

1743
01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:25.140
- He walked out topless... - Yes.

1744
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.880
- after taking a shower at home. - So?

1745
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.680
Daniel always wears a necklace.

1746
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.619
It looked very cool.

1747
01:09:33.619 --> 01:09:34.819
- So? - The necklace.

1748
01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:37.489
I thought I should try it,

1749
01:09:37.489 --> 01:09:39.460
so I found one and wore it.

1750
01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.359
- I wore it for two days. - And?

1751
01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.859
- Then I took a shower wearing it. - And?

1752
01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:44.899
I'm allergic to metal.

1753
01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.800
(I'm allergic to metal.)

1754
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:51.239
(Allergy terror)

1755
01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:53.100
(He feels bad.)

1756
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.609
- Oh, I see. - He got an allergic reaction.

1757
01:09:54.609 --> 01:09:56.510
- What? - They're singing Produce 101.

1758
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:57.979
- What? - They're singing Produce 101.

1759
01:09:57.979 --> 01:09:59.040
Oh, Produce 101.

1760
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.010
- It's out. - Wait.

1761
01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.050
(Is Daniel's prediction right?)

1762
01:10:03.609 --> 01:10:05.149
- Where? - "Never".

1763
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:06.149
- Room Three. - Good luck.

1764
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:08.720
"Never" doesn't count.

1765
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.559
- "Never" doesn't count? - It's in the album.

1766
01:10:10.559 --> 01:10:12.720
It's not Wanna One's, but Nation's Son.

1767
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.130
Right. It's Nation's Son's.

1768
01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:15.930
Oh, we didn't see that.

1769
01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:17.559
We actually talked about adding it.

1770
01:10:17.559 --> 01:10:21.170
- Only Wanna One's. - We don't count Wonder Girls.

1771
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:23.670
Only the song that all the members sang together.

1772
01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.069
That's a relief.

1773
01:10:25.069 --> 01:10:28.710
- We have a high chance. - They might sing it.

1774
01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:30.140
- Room Three has a high possibility. - Right.

1775
01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.779
(Please sing our song.)

1776
01:10:31.779 --> 01:10:32.939
Everywhere

1777
01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.279
- Oh, food. - We have food.

1778
01:10:36.279 --> 01:10:38.050
I was waiting for this.

1779
01:10:38.649 --> 01:10:40.949
- Food is here. - We have food.

1780
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:43.050
(He stands up automatically at the news of food.)

1781
01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:44.819
- What is it? - Let's eat.

1782
01:10:44.819 --> 01:10:45.989
- Let's eat when it's still hot. - Wait. The song...

1783
01:10:45.989 --> 01:10:48.059
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1784
01:10:48.559 --> 01:10:49.729
(They're amazed.)

1785
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:51.260
- Here. - Thank you.

1786
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.260
Pass it down.

1787
01:10:52.859 --> 01:10:54.869
(Hongdae's new rising food, cheese chicken)

1788
01:10:54.869 --> 01:10:56.300
- This is nice. - This is good.

1789
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.369
- It's a lot. - Right.

1790
01:10:57.369 --> 01:10:58.439
They're typing Wanna One.

1791
01:10:58.699 --> 01:10:59.739
They're typing Wanna One.

1792
01:11:00.199 --> 01:11:02.140
- Wanna One. - Wanna One.

1793
01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.340
- "Energetic". - Room Two.

1794
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.510
- "Energetic". - Room Two.

1795
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:06.580
(What would Room 3 choose?)

1796
01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.649
- They scrolled it down. - Room Two.

1797
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:09.510
They scrolled it down.

1798
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:11.479
- They did it. - Oh, you scared me.

1799
01:11:11.479 --> 01:11:12.519
- Did they do it? - They scrolled it down.

1800
01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:13.519
- They did it. - They scrolled it down.

1801
01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:14.519
Wait.

1802
01:11:14.519 --> 01:11:15.550
- They did it. - They scrolled it down.

1803
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:16.649
Wait.

1804
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:18.519
("Energetic" by Wanna One)

1805
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.790
(Awesome)

1806
01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:23.359
(Room 3 chose "Energetic".)

1807
01:11:23.359 --> 01:11:24.930
- Room 3 chose "Energetic". - Room 3.

1808
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:26.899
- We should go, right? - Room Three.

1809
01:11:26.899 --> 01:11:28.930
- We should go, right? - Room Three.

1810
01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:30.670
- Room Three. - When they start singing.

1811
01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:32.600
- The food... - We have to eat it.

1812
01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.710
- You can't eat it. - Leave the food.

1813
01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.040
When your song plays, you can't eat the food.

1814
01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.140
Do you want to eat the food or do you want to go?

1815
01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.439
We'd rather go.

1816
01:11:40.439 --> 01:11:41.449
If you eat the food, you can't go.

1817
01:11:42.809 --> 01:11:45.220
Wait for them to sing for a bit.

1818
01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.649
Wait. They might not sing it.

1819
01:11:46.649 --> 01:11:48.920
- They might not sing it. - They stop after the first part.

1820
01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.019
They might stop it.

1821
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:54.330
He's the one. The one that looks like a dog.

1822
01:11:55.059 --> 01:11:56.659
- He's Kang Daniel. - Right.

1823
01:11:57.159 --> 01:11:58.960
(I'll be there soon.)

1824
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:04.369
(Sing "Energetic" recklessly.)

1825
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.899
You can go for "Energetic" now.

1826
01:12:06.899 --> 01:12:08.040
(They're attacking the karaoke.)

1827
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.609
- It's Wanna One as I expected. - Wanna One's up first.

1828
01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:11.640
However...

1829
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.609
- People in that room are so lucky. - I know.

1830
01:12:14.609 --> 01:12:15.750
As soon as we opened the food.

1831
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.080
How would it feel to see Wanna One suddenly?

1832
01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:19.279
We have no time. Hurry up.

1833
01:12:20.119 --> 01:12:22.290
- It's fun. - Hurry up.

1834
01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:24.090
- Hurry up. - Hurry up.

1835
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.220
- Hurry up. - Hurry up.

1836
01:12:25.489 --> 01:12:27.090
- This is awesome. - We have no time.

1837
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.830
Oh, this is...

1838
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:31.159
- This is exciting, isn't it? - Yes.

1839
01:12:31.159 --> 01:12:33.260
When you walk in,

1840
01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.569
- Do we just sing? - sing.

1841
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.800
It's Seok Jin's first time.

1842
01:12:38.399 --> 01:12:41.140
(I'm going crazy)

1843
01:12:41.369 --> 01:12:43.540
(You cannot stop me)

(Wanna One in the monitor screen...)

1845

(comes to life.)

1846
01:12:57.519 --> 01:13:00.119
(Is this a dream?)

1847
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:03.960
(As if they just walked out from the monitor...)

1848
01:13:04.859 --> 01:13:06.159
(She's overwhelmed.)

1849
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.340
(Wanna One appeared in front of their eyes.)

1850
01:13:13.399 --> 01:13:16.540
(They're so shocked that they became speechless.)

1851
01:13:19.779 --> 01:13:21.850
(They're back to themselves. They start enjoying it.)

1852
01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:22.850
Are you having fun?

1853
01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:24.979
(Dancing)

1854
01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:30.319
(They're singing passionately for the girls.)

1855
01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:35.790
(Is this high pitch real?)

1856
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.170
(Daniel's up.)

1857
01:13:42.199 --> 01:13:43.800
(He joins the table naturally.)

1858
01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.640
(Wanna One's mini concert in the karaoke)

1859
01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.040
They're frozen.

1860
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.080
- They're surprised. - They're so surprised.

1861
01:13:54.409 --> 01:13:55.479
They're so surprised.

1862
01:13:55.479 --> 01:13:57.779
They would never forget it.

1863
01:13:57.779 --> 01:13:59.420
- Of course. - Right.

1864
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.489
- They can't even scream. - They can't even make a sound.

1865
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:06.059
(He's singing next to them.)

1866
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:09.989
(Karaoke attack is a success.)

1867
01:14:09.989 --> 01:14:11.130
- Hello. - Hello.

1868
01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:12.229
- Hello. - Hello.

1869
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:14.300
Nice to meet you. We're from Happy Together.

1870
01:14:15.199 --> 01:14:16.970
- Were you surprised? - Yes. So much.

1871
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:19.040
You were so surprised. How did you feel when Wanna One walked in?

1872
01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.300
- Pardon? - They're handsome.

1873
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.809
- They're handsome. - Who's your favorite?

1874
01:14:21.809 --> 01:14:22.869
Kang Daniel.

1875
01:14:23.909 --> 01:14:25.109
I pick Min Hyun.

1876
01:14:25.109 --> 01:14:27.510
- Let's go up. - I'm so happy.

1877
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:28.850
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1878
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:30.380
We'd appreciate it if you could go up with us.

1879
01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.819
We already have the first one. Has it been 40 minutes?

1880
01:14:33.819 --> 01:14:35.189
- "Gashina". - What?

1881
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:36.489
- "Gashina". - What?

1882
01:14:36.949 --> 01:14:38.920
- Is that "Gashinayo"? - "Gashinayo".

1883
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.830
("Gashina")

1884
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:42.260
- Gashinayo - "Gashinayo".

1885
01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:43.760
- "Gashinayo". - "Gashinayo".

1886
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.229
Doesn't it count?

1887
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:46.500
(It's a funny twist.)

1888
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.269
- "Gashinayo". - "Gashinayo".

1889
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.699
(She was excited for a second.)

1890
01:14:49.699 --> 01:14:50.739
"Gashinayo".

1891
01:14:50.739 --> 01:14:52.239
They're here.

1892
01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:53.500
Congratulations.

1893
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.840
(Welcome)

1894
01:14:56.439 --> 01:14:57.609
You're beautiful.

1895
01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.809
Congratulations.

1896
01:14:58.809 --> 01:15:00.479
I know you're surprised.

1897
01:15:00.479 --> 01:15:02.180
Can you introduce yourselves briefly?

1898
01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:05.180
Hello. I'm Kwon Jae Hee from Gyeonggi Province.

1899
01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:07.050
- Jae Hee. - She's pretty.

1900
01:15:07.489 --> 01:15:11.159
Hello. I'm Bae Gyu Na from Goyang-si.

1901
01:15:11.159 --> 01:15:12.189
- I see. - Okay.

1902
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:14.390
What brought you to Hongdae today?

1903
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:17.729
- We have a day off. - What do you do?

1904
01:15:17.729 --> 01:15:19.729
- We work at a hotel. - I knew it.

1905
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:22.369
You were very polite when you greeted.

1906
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:25.739
- I see. - I see.

1907
01:15:25.739 --> 01:15:28.769
When you first entered, Wanna One's music video was playing.

1908
01:15:28.769 --> 01:15:30.470
- Who was it? - We heard it.

1909
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:31.909
Someone said, "Is that them?"

1910
01:15:31.909 --> 01:15:33.180
Who said it?

1911
01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:35.779
"Is that them?"

1912
01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.819
I was checking to see if they're the ones I know.

1913
01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.189
Wanna One...

1914
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:43.050
Honestly, I don't know them well.

1915
01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:44.220
Oh, you don't know them well.

1916
01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.390
- Who knows them well? - Her.

1917
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:46.390
- Her. - Her.

1918
01:15:46.689 --> 01:15:49.359
They recommend each other.

1919
01:15:49.359 --> 01:15:50.390
(Let's say they both do.)

1920
01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.930
Wanna One succeeded with "Energetic",

1921
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:55.930
but unfortunately, they can't eat the food.

1922
01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:57.130
(Unfortunately, they can't eat the food.)

1923
01:15:58.369 --> 01:15:59.869
We'd like to give it to you, but it's the rule.

1924
01:16:00.939 --> 01:16:02.809
(They were listening carelessly.)

1925
01:16:03.109 --> 01:16:05.309
- For real? - It's the rule.

1926
01:16:05.309 --> 01:16:07.979
You should've sang five minutes late.

1927
01:16:07.979 --> 01:16:10.819
Daniel's so disappointed.

1928
01:16:10.819 --> 01:16:12.220
- I can't eat it? - If you sang five minutes late.

1929
01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:14.149
- He's so disappointed. - It's the rule.

1930
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:15.390
Can we take it to go?

1931
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:17.519
You can't do that.

1932
01:16:17.519 --> 01:16:20.119
- They're disappointed for real. - Yes.

1933
01:16:20.119 --> 01:16:21.559
I've never seen anyone like them.

1934
01:16:21.559 --> 01:16:23.590
Daniel's very hungry right now.

1935
01:16:24.029 --> 01:16:27.430
Since they're our blood brothers, let's give them one.

1936
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:28.830
(Thank you.)

1937
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:30.869
- To these three people, - Yes.

1938
01:16:30.869 --> 01:16:33.540
we'll give them an album as a gift.

1939
01:16:34.809 --> 01:16:36.640
We have it in the back with Wanna One's autograph.

1940
01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.279
We'll give you Wanna One's album with their autographs.

1941
01:16:39.279 --> 01:16:40.309
- Here. - Thank you.

1942
01:16:40.949 --> 01:16:42.449
- Thank you. - Is that T-shirt a gift?

1943
01:16:42.449 --> 01:16:44.279
Is this T-shirt a gift?

1944
01:16:44.279 --> 01:16:45.319
No. That's from Wheesung.

1945
01:16:45.319 --> 01:16:46.319
- That's from Wheesung. - Oh, Wheesung.

1946
01:16:46.319 --> 01:16:48.350
That's ours. Come on.

1947
01:16:48.819 --> 01:16:51.189
- Come on. - That's from Wheesung.

1948
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:52.859
Can't we give it to them as a gift?

1949
01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:55.890
No. They didn't sing our song. No.

1950
01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:57.529
- Sometimes you can't. - Why would you be angry?

1951
01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:59.430
- I'm not. I'm saying that's ours. - He's not happy.

1952
01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:00.930
Hey. That's ours.

1953
01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:02.569
- Hey. What are you doing? - We haven't even started yet.

1954
01:17:02.569 --> 01:17:05.239
- Why would you take them? - He's weird.

1955
01:17:05.239 --> 01:17:07.340
- What are you doing? - I mean...

1956
01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:09.640
- Gosh. - What are you doing?

1957
01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.779
We have to return it now.

1958
01:17:11.779 --> 01:17:12.909
Why would you take this?

1959
01:17:12.909 --> 01:17:14.050
It's been a while since I go home early.

1960
01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:16.449
- Gosh. No. - Why would you take the albums?

1961
01:17:16.449 --> 01:17:19.779
Enjoy your time.

1962
01:17:19.779 --> 01:17:22.149
- Let's thank them again. - Thank you.

1963
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:24.019
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1964
01:17:24.019 --> 01:17:25.290
- Thank you. - Enjoy your time.

1965
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:27.890
- I'm very happy. - Pardon?

1966
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.930
- It's exciting. - In the elevator...

1967
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:31.899
When I saw it in the screen, I got so excited.

1968
01:17:31.899 --> 01:17:33.460
I talked so fast. I was in a rush to get there.

1969
01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.930
- Min Hyun kept watching it. - Yes.

1970
01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:36.600
How did you feel, Seok Jin?

1971
01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:39.369
It can never be better.

1972
01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.809
It's my first time.

1973
01:17:41.809 --> 01:17:44.309
I was always the last one to go home.

1974
01:17:44.309 --> 01:17:46.739
So it was the people born in 1981 who were cursed.

1975
01:17:46.739 --> 01:17:48.010
Seok Jin wasn't cursed.

1976
01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:49.180
Right.

1977
01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.949
- That was the problem. - Right.

1978
01:17:50.949 --> 01:17:52.080
Why would you make him sad?

1979
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.050
When Seok Jin is not partnered with someone born in 1981,

1980
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.189
he gets to go home early.

1981
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:56.750
All right.

1982
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:59.489
Wanna One is always too busy to eat well.

1983
01:17:59.489 --> 01:18:01.390
We usually don't give our guests food,

1984
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:02.729
but you are our brothers.

1985
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:05.130
- That's why we're giving you food. - Take this with you.

1986
01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.399
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

1987
01:18:06.399 --> 01:18:08.130
Please take a photo with Wheesung.

1988
01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:09.199
Give them some chopsticks too.

1989
01:18:09.199 --> 01:18:10.330
- I love it. - Are those new?

1990
01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:11.869
That's really precious to you, isn't it?

1991
01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.909
- I'm... - Really?

1992
01:18:13.909 --> 01:18:15.609
- He loves his snacks. - He's obsessed.

1993
01:18:15.609 --> 01:18:17.180
- All right. - You should move forward.

1994
01:18:17.279 --> 01:18:18.609
(They take a photo to celebrate Wanna One's going home.)

1995
01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:21.649
(Wheesung's Instagram)

1996
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:24.250
I love it.

1997
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.319
(They're happy to be the first to go home.)

1998
01:18:25.319 --> 01:18:26.550
We are just thrilled.

1999
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:29.189
We were thankful that people enjoyed it.

2000
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:31.890
It made us happy...

2001
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:33.590
to meet our fans...

2002
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:34.729
and to talk to them.

2003
01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:38.159
We feel proud that we made...

2004
01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:40.029
someone's day very special.

2005
01:18:40.769 --> 01:18:42.229
We love you.

2006
01:18:43.199 --> 01:18:46.239
Let's have some night snack.

2007
01:18:46.239 --> 01:18:47.439
(This night snack will comfort their mind and body.)

2008
01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:49.840
Have a taste, Sun Mi.

2009
01:18:50.409 --> 01:18:52.880
(It's sweet and sour...)

2010
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.850
(chicken stir-fry with cheese.)

2011
01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.250
This is just the beginning.

2012
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:59.920
When you hear your song, you have to run there.

2013
01:19:00.619 --> 01:19:02.390
You're watching, right?

2014
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:03.519
- It's really delicious. - We have to watch it.

2015
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:05.689
That doesn't matter. You have to look there.

2016
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:07.390
- What did you say? - I said I'm staying long.

2017
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:08.390
You have to watch them.

2018
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:09.430
(I am watching.)

2019
01:19:11.159 --> 01:19:14.199
Now that Wanna One is gone, it feels very empty.

2020
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:17.199
- I know. - They're singing "Pick Me" again.

2021
01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.899
- They love it. - They love that song.

2022
01:19:19.899 --> 01:19:22.170
Since it's boring, should we play rock-paper-scissors?

2023
01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:23.210
- What? - Why would we do that?

2024
01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:24.239
The winner wins a chance card.

2025
01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:25.439
But we already did it.

2026
01:19:26.439 --> 01:19:27.479
She's strange, isn't she?

2027
01:19:27.479 --> 01:19:29.149
You could've just play along.

2028
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:30.149
(She's still sad that she didn't get to win the chance card.)

2029
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.380
Play along?

2030
01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:34.319
Let's see her acting cute and...

2031
01:19:34.319 --> 01:19:35.790
We've already seen a lot.

2032
01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:38.260
- Give her a chance. - We've seen enough.

2033
01:19:38.489 --> 01:19:40.630
We've seen enough, haven't we?

2034
01:19:41.659 --> 01:19:42.729
Stop it.

2035
01:19:44.059 --> 01:19:45.529
She's unbelievable.

2036
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:47.869
- She's so cheerful. - She is.

2037
01:19:47.869 --> 01:19:50.330
Now, each time a team leaves,

2038
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:52.140
the atmosphere drastically changes.

2039
01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:53.170
(Each time a team leaves, the feeling of emptiness grows.)

2040
01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:54.710
- It really happens. - Right.

2041
01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:55.809
The atmosphere already changed.

2042
01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:58.140
Now...

2043
01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.140
- What is it? - What is it?

2044
01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.880
I saw my name.

2045
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.080
- You surprised me. -It's the usual symptom.

2046
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.149
- Why? - Press it.

2047
01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:07.050
- You get surprised... - Press it.

2048
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:08.090
when you see your name.

2049
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:10.449
- They stopped at Wheesung. - They stopped.

2050
01:20:10.449 --> 01:20:11.460
- Press it. - They stopped.

2051
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.489
Press it.

2052
01:20:12.489 --> 01:20:13.659
The people at Room One stopped at Wheesung.

2053
01:20:13.659 --> 01:20:14.890
- Will they press it? - Amazing.

2054
01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:15.960
(Please press the reserve button.)

2055
01:20:16.559 --> 01:20:17.559
- Did they press it? - They did.

2056
01:20:17.559 --> 01:20:19.500
- Wait. - They didn't.

2057
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.430
- What happened? - They went backwards.

2058
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:23.300
They went backwards.

2059
01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.300
My gosh.

2060
01:20:24.939 --> 01:20:26.199
That was close.

2061
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:29.809
I thought you wanted to stay until the end.

2062
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:34.449
I saw my name, and I was glad to see it.

2063
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.649
We will change the tape.

2064
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:37.680
- Should we do that? - Yes.

2065
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.649
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3.

2066
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:40.689
(It's break time.)

2067
01:20:41.119 --> 01:20:42.819
(The cameras are off,)

2068
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:44.059
Let's do it again.

2069
01:20:44.059 --> 01:20:45.090
(and they are having fun.)

2070
01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:46.989
Let's do it again.

2071
01:20:47.119 --> 01:20:48.590
It doesn't get pinned to the board.

2072
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:49.659
(Sun Mi is the only one staring at the monitor.)

2073
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:52.430
- Now... - Someone is singing mine.

2074
01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:53.930
- Where? - There!

2075
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:55.100
- Where? - "Rain Drop".

2076
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.100
"Rain Drop".

2077
01:20:58.899 --> 01:21:00.670
(It's really Wheesung's song.)

2078
01:21:01.909 --> 01:21:04.239
- Aren't they singing it? - Let's check Room One.

2079
01:21:04.239 --> 01:21:05.779
- Let's check Room One. - What is it?

2080
01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:06.809
Rain Drop.

2081
01:21:06.809 --> 01:21:08.250
(It showers)

2082
01:21:08.909 --> 01:21:09.909
Is it "Rain Drop"?

2083
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:12.649
(They're really singing it.)

2084
01:21:13.479 --> 01:21:14.819
- Wheesung! - "Rain Drop".

2085
01:21:14.989 --> 01:21:16.290
Is that Wheesung's song?

2086
01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:17.760
Wait. Wheesung did it.

2087
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.760
(Hurrah, Wheesung!)

2088
01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.790
- Let's go. - Wait.

2089
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:22.330
(I can't believe I'm the runner-up!)

2090
01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:23.630
What's wrong with him?

2091
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:25.859
(He's overly excited.)

2092
01:21:26.199 --> 01:21:28.369
I thought he didn't care about the competition.

2093
01:21:28.369 --> 01:21:29.769
- Wait. - Wheesung.

2094
01:21:29.769 --> 01:21:31.699
- You said you weren't interested. - You did it.

2095
01:21:31.699 --> 01:21:33.439
You said you weren't interested in the competition.

2096
01:21:34.739 --> 01:21:36.369
- But I am too happy. - You look happy.

2097
01:21:36.369 --> 01:21:38.140
- He went through a lot. - Today...

2098
01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.540
(It's been a tough day for him.)

2099
01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:41.909
(Wanna One expected him to go home last.)

2100
01:21:43.949 --> 01:21:47.619
(He was waiting without any hope.)

2101
01:21:47.619 --> 01:21:49.350
We're the last!

2102
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:50.559
You don't know yet.

2103
01:21:50.559 --> 01:21:52.159
- Everyone... - It's been tough for him.

2104
01:21:52.159 --> 01:21:55.029
expected him to go home...

2105
01:21:55.029 --> 01:21:56.159
- last. - Wait.

2106
01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:57.460
But he's the second one to go home.

2107
01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.029
This song...

2108
01:21:59.029 --> 01:22:00.330
did so poorly when I sung it.

2109
01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:02.800
IU did a cover of it and that became a hit.

2110
01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.939
But she's singing my version.

2111
01:22:04.939 --> 01:22:07.840
(She's singing Wheesung's version of the song.)

2112
01:22:08.269 --> 01:22:09.909
- This is touching. - It is.

2113
01:22:09.909 --> 01:22:11.580
He's nearly crying.

2114
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.840
Why are you crying?

2115
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.949
- He's been through a lot. - I was so worried.

2116
01:22:14.949 --> 01:22:17.109
- You're nearly crying. - I am not.

2117
01:22:17.109 --> 01:22:18.619
- He's nearly crying. - By the way,

2118
01:22:18.619 --> 01:22:19.949
shouldn't we hurry there?

2119
01:22:19.949 --> 01:22:22.689
- She might stop in the middle. - Let's hurry.

2120
01:22:22.689 --> 01:22:24.790
- Wheesung. - We're worried too.

2121
01:22:25.359 --> 01:22:26.659
What if she's not my fan?

2122
01:22:26.659 --> 01:22:28.630
Sun Mi might be the last one to go.

2123
01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:29.760
It's not the time to dance.

2124
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.130
- Don't dance. - Will she go last?

2125
01:22:32.359 --> 01:22:33.970
- Wait. - It's not the time for that.

2126
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.600
(Thank you for choosing my version over IU's version.)

2127
01:22:39.439 --> 01:22:42.109
(I will run to you right now.)

2128
01:22:43.309 --> 01:22:44.710
(I am...)

2129
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.239
(coming to meet you.)

2130
01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.949
Some customers are using the elevator.

2131
01:22:49.949 --> 01:22:51.019
(The customers are waiting for the elevator.)

2132
01:22:51.019 --> 01:22:52.080
No way.

2133
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.149
(They are on the 2nd floor.)

2134
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:54.619
(They need to get on the elevator to go to the 4th floor.)

2135
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:57.790
What if the song ends?

2136
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:59.920
If it ends before you enter, you will fail.

2137
01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.890
Can't we use the stairs?

2138
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:03.630
You can't use the stairs. People will find out.

2139
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:05.430
Take your time.

2140
01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.300
I think the song is nearly ending.

2141
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.300
(She's singing the 2nd verse.)

2142
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:13.369
(It's a bad timing.)

2143
01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:16.640
(The customers are preventing Wheesung from going home.)

2144
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.210
(He can't just wait.)

2145
01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.880
(He's got no time to waste.)

2146
01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.949
- How... - Wait!

2147
01:23:27.949 --> 01:23:29.920
Room Three is singing "Love Battery".

2148
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.489
(Room 3 is singing "Love Battery".)

2149
01:23:33.359 --> 01:23:34.760
(Wheesung's song is nearly ending, and Jin Young's is starting.)

2150
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.260
- Wait. - Let's go.

2151
01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:37.600
Room Three is singing "Love Battery".

2152
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.800
No! No!

2153
01:23:41.699 --> 01:23:43.369
Why?

2154
01:23:43.569 --> 01:23:46.000
Wheesung has to go first.

2155
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.309
Go!

2156
01:23:47.309 --> 01:23:49.909
- Hurry. - They chose "Love Battery".

2157
01:23:50.069 --> 01:23:51.109
Should I press the button?

2158
01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:52.109
(Wheesung is about to get on the elevator.)

2159
01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.479
This is crazy.

2160
01:23:54.479 --> 01:23:55.649
- You can go now. - Let's go.

2161
01:23:55.649 --> 01:23:56.710
(Jin Young goes to the karaoke too.)

2162
01:23:56.809 --> 01:23:58.080
- It's okay. - We're ruined, Sun Mi.

2163
01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:01.220
I told you we should've chosen Wonder Girls' song.

2164
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:03.859
- But nobody sang that either. - Wait for me.

2165
01:24:03.859 --> 01:24:06.290
- We're ruined. - It's chaotic.

2166
01:24:07.489 --> 01:24:09.729
(The song is nearly ending.)

2167
01:24:11.059 --> 01:24:13.899
(They finally enter the karaoke.)

2168
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.170
(They have to enter the room before the song ends.)

2169
01:24:17.130 --> 01:24:19.069
(What will happen?)

2170
01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.470
(They made it!)

2171
01:24:23.609 --> 01:24:24.939
(He instinctively grabs the mic.)

2172
01:24:25.979 --> 01:24:27.140
(He's dumbfounded.)

2173
01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.250
Hello.

2174
01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:30.350
It's Wheesung.

2175
01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:32.619
(She's surprised.)

2176
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:36.989
Wheesung is happy...

2177
01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:40.159
because this song originally didn't do well when he sung it.

2178
01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:44.930
When IU sang it, many people love it.

2179
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.330
But she's singing Wheesung's version,

2180
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:48.670
and that made Wheesung emotional.

2181
01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:50.800
- We didn't know about that story. - There was that story.

2182
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.340
- Right. - We only found out now.

2183
01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.739
Let's check Room Three.

2184
01:24:53.739 --> 01:24:55.239
They went in.

2185
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.949
(Jin Young enters the room.)

2186
01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:03.309
(They're shocked.)

2187
01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.949
(They are trying to figure out what is happening.)

2188
01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:12.319
(Give me love)

2189
01:25:12.319 --> 01:25:13.319
Give me!

2190
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:15.960
(She now understands what happened.)

2191
01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:20.059
(Jin Young puts on a special performance.)

2192
01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:22.699
2 teams succeeded at the same time. This is the 1st time.

2193
01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:25.699
It's the 1st time to see 2 teams singing at the karaoke.

2194
01:25:25.699 --> 01:25:26.699
Two teams are there.

2195
01:25:28.439 --> 01:25:31.309
(The king of rhythm and blues and queen of trot seize the karaoke.)

2196
01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:34.210
I never knew this day would come.

2197
01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:36.109
"Gashina" is yet to come out.

2198
01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:37.109
(Sun Mi will be the last one to go home.)

2199
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:39.649
- How can she go home last? - My goodness.

2200
01:25:40.819 --> 01:25:42.550
(Wheesung only got to sing a few bars.)

2201
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:43.960
We almost failed.

2202
01:25:46.159 --> 01:25:48.260
(He ends it nicely.)

2203
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.689
It ended.

2204
01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:54.630
(He's overwhelmed.)

2205
01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:56.369
It nearly ended.

2206
01:25:57.369 --> 01:25:58.800
The end was near when we entered. You saw it, right?

2207
01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.840
(It was a good performance.)

2208
01:26:00.069 --> 01:26:02.439
(They are still having fun.)

2209
01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.409
(They still can't believe it.)

2210
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:08.550
(She sings more passionate than ever.)

2211
01:26:11.319 --> 01:26:13.580
(You are my battery)

2212
01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:16.819
(The battery is charged.)

2213
01:26:16.819 --> 01:26:17.859
I can't believe it.

2214
01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.819
Oh, gosh.

2215
01:26:21.659 --> 01:26:22.659
(Her heart nearly stopped.)

2216
01:26:22.659 --> 01:26:23.689
I was shocked.

2217
01:26:23.729 --> 01:26:24.800
I can't believe it.

2218
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:29.000
This is the 1st time 2 teams succeeded at the same time.

2219
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
(2 teams succeeded at the same time for the 1st time.)

2220
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.439
Let's give it up for everybody.

2221
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:37.140
Let's talk to Wheesung's team first.

2222
01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.510
We heard this song is not very popular,

2223
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:41.210
and it didn't become a hit...

2224
01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:43.279
when Wheesung sang it.

2225
01:26:43.279 --> 01:26:46.350
But it became popular when IU sang it.

2226
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:48.489
Today, you sang Wheesung's version.

2227
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:51.390
You sang Wheesung's version, right?

2228
01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:55.159
She likes the original version more,

2229
01:26:55.159 --> 01:26:56.859
so she sings it often.

2230
01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:59.199
How did you feel when Wheesung entered?

2231
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.300
(Let me take that for you.)

2232
01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.239
- That's not even heavy. - He's so sweet.

2233
01:27:04.239 --> 01:27:05.500
- My goodness. - She's his baby.

2234
01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.269
He's very sweet.

2235
01:27:07.269 --> 01:27:09.739
He's very sweet. Please tell us about it.

2236
01:27:09.739 --> 01:27:13.010
He looks different in real life, so I didn't recognize him at first.

2237
01:27:13.239 --> 01:27:15.210
But he's really handsome.

2238
01:27:15.649 --> 01:27:16.649
Thank you.

2239
01:27:16.649 --> 01:27:18.550
We need to talk.

2240
01:27:19.449 --> 01:27:21.119
(Wheesung becomes restless.)

2241
01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:24.390
- What did he say? - He's jealous.

2242
01:27:24.559 --> 01:27:26.390
How did you feel when Wheesung entered?

2243
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:28.989
I am Wheesung's fan.

2244
01:27:28.989 --> 01:27:32.960
I love listening to Wheesung's songs.

2245
01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.269
But I can't manage singing his songs.

2246
01:27:35.269 --> 01:27:36.330
(He can't dare to sing the masterpieces.)

2247
01:27:37.699 --> 01:27:40.439
I like the old songs such as "Incurable Disease".

2248
01:27:40.439 --> 01:27:42.510
I love those songs.

2249
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:43.670
You're a big fan.

2250
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.239
(That's the title song of his third album in 2004.)

2251
01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.979
(He's been Wheesung's fan for a very long time.)

2252
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:52.519
(It's a meaningful encounter.)

2253
01:27:52.519 --> 01:27:54.189
- Also, - Yes.

2254
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:56.489
two teams succeeded at the same time. This isn't common.

2255
01:27:56.489 --> 01:27:57.489
- It's the first time. - Right.

2256
01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:58.760
"Love Battery".

2257
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:01.659
(Jang Eun Ji, Lee Ah Ran)

2258
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:04.600
What brought you to karaoke today?

2259
01:28:04.659 --> 01:28:09.529
We were here for a good salmon donburi restaurant.

2260
01:28:09.529 --> 01:28:10.540
Okay.

2261
01:28:11.269 --> 01:28:14.309
- We stopped by before going. - We stopped by to get hungry.

2262
01:28:15.909 --> 01:28:18.609
- Before you eat delicious salmon, - Yes.

2263
01:28:18.609 --> 01:28:21.180
you wanted to make yourselves hungry.

2264
01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:22.979
- To be hungry? - To be hungry.

2265
01:28:22.979 --> 01:28:25.779
When someone opened the door,

2266
01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.489
I thought they were going to tell us to leave.

2267
01:28:28.489 --> 01:28:31.519
But Hong Jin Young walked in.

2268
01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.760
It was so...

2269
01:28:34.890 --> 01:28:35.960
(She's still trembling.)

2270
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.960
She's really cute.

2271
01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.760
- It's an album with my autograph. - Yes.

2272
01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.369
It's a perfect size for him.

2273
01:28:41.369 --> 01:28:42.970
- It's for you. - Thank you.

2274
01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:45.369
They helped me go home happy.

2275
01:28:45.369 --> 01:28:47.670
I'm very happy to be here today.

2276
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:49.710
- "Meaningful". - "Meaningful".

2277
01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.510
She keeps saying that.

2278
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:55.979
So now, Wheesung and Jin Young can go home.

2279
01:28:55.979 --> 01:28:57.080
(Wheesung and Jin Young are off together.)

2280
01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.649
It's the first time to be off together.

2281
01:28:59.479 --> 01:29:00.819
- Hey. - I'm leaving.

2282
01:29:00.819 --> 01:29:03.019
- Bye. - Bye.

2283
01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.890
I wasn't planning to go home early today.

2284
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:09.290
I think I'm lucky.

2285
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:10.390
- Pardon? - I'm lucky.

2286
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:12.800
Are you having a talk show?

2287
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.970
I'm lucky.

2288
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:17.439
- I'm enjoying the shooting today. - Right.

2289
01:29:17.439 --> 01:29:18.439
It's true.

2290
01:29:18.439 --> 01:29:20.369
We're having fun because of you.

2291
01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.540
- Why? - Because you're staying.

2292
01:29:23.609 --> 01:29:26.779
We'll think about using the chance in 5 minutes.

2293
01:29:26.779 --> 01:29:28.909
- Use the chance before 10 minutes. - Yes.

2294
01:29:28.909 --> 01:29:30.819
- She's the finale. - Yes.

2295
01:29:30.819 --> 01:29:33.550
- No. I won't use the chance. - Are you sure?

2296
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:37.050
You shouldn't decide it alone.

2297
01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:39.420
It's regardless of time.

2298
01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:41.359
Let's check Room One.

2299
01:29:41.689 --> 01:29:42.689
Are they...

2300
01:29:43.159 --> 01:29:45.330
("Love Fool" by The Nuts)

2301
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.399
- It's an old song. - I think they'll sing "Gashina".

2302
01:29:47.399 --> 01:29:49.769
Let's check Room Two.

2303
01:29:50.029 --> 01:29:52.670
(Room 2's on fire.)

2304
01:29:52.670 --> 01:29:54.510
After this...

2305
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:56.670
Room Two is going crazy.

2306
01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:57.779
(They're going crazy.)

2307
01:29:58.809 --> 01:29:59.909
Put it down please.

2308
01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:03.210
Usually when they sing "Fire",

2309
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:06.180
they dance like this, but he's...

2310
01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.390
(Fierce dance)

2311
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:10.790
(Fire)

2312
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:13.390
- He's impetuous. - That's not common.

2313
01:30:14.890 --> 01:30:16.229
(Then...)

2314
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:17.630
- Room Three. - "Gashina".

2315
01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:18.630
- Wait. - Yong Man.

2316
01:30:19.359 --> 01:30:21.029
- It's real. - Put up Room Three.

2317
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.239
- It's awesome. - We were talking about Room Three.

2318
01:30:24.239 --> 01:30:25.239
See?

2319
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.640
They're singing.

2320
01:30:27.439 --> 01:30:28.670
My neck...

2321
01:30:28.670 --> 01:30:30.979
- Gosh. - just hurt.

2322
01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.809
It's shocking.

2323
01:30:33.239 --> 01:30:34.279
I'm surprised.

2324
01:30:34.279 --> 01:30:35.350
(She's glad to see her song as much as she waited.)

2325
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:37.779
- Sun Mi... - Go to Room Three.

2326
01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:39.920
You kept your pride.

2327
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.390
- Today, - It's good, Sun Mi.

2328
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:43.750
everyone went home without a chance.

2329
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.189
Hurry up.

2330
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:46.290
(Are you going to Room 3?)

2331
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:49.390
Let me open the door for you. 1, 2...

2332
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:52.630
(There's a shadow outside the door.)

2333
01:30:54.269 --> 01:30:57.269
(Everyone. Sun Mi's here.)

2334
01:30:57.699 --> 01:31:00.069
(They froze.)

2335
01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:02.510
(Isn't that Sun Mi?)

2336
01:31:03.269 --> 01:31:05.710
(He's smiling brightly.)

2337
01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.609
Let's sing it together.

2338
01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:12.149
(Is Sun Mi dancing in front of me?)

2339
01:31:12.819 --> 01:31:15.319
- What's going on? - This is crazy.

2340
01:31:15.989 --> 01:31:17.460
Dance with me.

2341
01:31:17.489 --> 01:31:19.090
Dance with her.

2342
01:31:20.630 --> 01:31:21.659
Awesome.

2343
01:31:23.059 --> 01:31:24.059
Sing with her.

2344
01:31:24.059 --> 01:31:25.859
(She can go home.)

2345
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.970
("Gashina" with Sun Mi)

2346
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:33.069
(It's fun.)

2347
01:31:38.479 --> 01:31:39.779
(Are you leaving me?)

2348
01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.409
(It was a good performance.)

2349
01:31:41.409 --> 01:31:42.479
Awesome.

2350
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:46.880
- Thank you. - You must've been surprised.

2351
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:48.350
Did we scare you?

2352
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:50.149
Congratulations.

2353
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:52.290
- This is it. - Congratulations.

2354
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:55.760
Do you sing "Gashina" often when you go to a karaoke?

2355
01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.760
Yes. I sing it almost every time.

2356
01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:59.159
(She's touched.)

2357
01:31:59.159 --> 01:32:02.300
How did you feel when you saw Sun Mi?

2358
01:32:02.399 --> 01:32:04.300
- I was so surprised. - How about you?

2359
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.869
- I've seen this show a few times. - Yes.

2360
01:32:07.069 --> 01:32:10.710
I imagined of you entering. I really did.

2361
01:32:10.710 --> 01:32:12.680
People know us now.

2362
01:32:12.779 --> 01:32:14.080
I was really surprised.

2363
01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:16.680
Your imagination came true today.

2364
01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.420
- Yes. - She showed up in front of you.

2365
01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:21.250

She wouldn't dance so hard even on the stage.

2367
01:32:25.659 --> 01:32:28.559

That's how legendary these singers we had today are.

2370

- Right. - It's a Legend Special.

2371

(Finale singers)

2377
01:32:52.019 --> 01:32:53.449
(How were they after the show?)

2378
01:32:53.449 --> 01:32:54.689
(It was terrible.)

2379
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:57.189
(I should be modest.)

2380
01:32:57.819 --> 01:33:00.729
(A battle with their pride)

2381
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:04.029
(I'm going to be the last again.)

2382
