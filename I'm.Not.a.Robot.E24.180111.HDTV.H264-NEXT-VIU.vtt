00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.007
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:14.954
My goodness.

3
00:00:28.877 --> 00:00:32.646
(The Monami folder got leaked.)

4
00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:38.816
We succeeded in opening the folder,

5
00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:41.386
but the video file got damaged while getting transferred to our system.

6
00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:46.697
But we managed to save a short clip that lasts about a few minutes.

7
00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:51.937
But their password was a little funny.

8
00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:53.337
It was "Sandwich".

9
00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:55.507
Okay.

10
00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.946
We failed to steal Aji 3's technical file,

11
00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.657
but we managed to save an unexpected video clip.

12
00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:13.887
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:49.527
My goodness gracious!

14
00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:53.426
What? Friend Mode?

15
00:01:55.327 --> 00:01:57.327
He was such a show-off.

16
00:01:57.327 --> 00:01:58.967
Do you think you can be my friend?

17
00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:02.006
He had no idea what a fool he made of himself.

18
00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:12.316
Dad.

19
00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:15.916
You know I love you, right?

20
00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:18.886
Of course I do. And I love myself too.

21
00:02:19.957 --> 00:02:23.057
Then will you let me go now?

22
00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:26.356
I...

23
00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:30.166
want to live the way I want and follow my will.

24
00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.437
I like someone...

25
00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:37.467
and I don't want to be engaged to or marry Min Kyu.

26
00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:41.147
This place makes good coffee.

27
00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:43.147
Dad, please.

28
00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:46.377
I'm talking to you sincerely.

29
00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:48.717
I'll be sincere with you as well.

30
00:02:50.147 --> 00:02:52.756
Your partner is Kim Min Kyu.

31
00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:55.886
Don't make me lose...

32
00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.527
the respect I have for you.

33
00:03:00.057 --> 00:03:01.166
Please.

34
00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:27.957
I'm really sorry.

35
00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.856
We're booked for lunch, so I can't take any more guests.

36
00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:32.927
Well, we aren't here to eat.

37
00:03:33.027 --> 00:03:35.867
- Is Jo Ji A here? - Hello.

38
00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:37.666
Hi.

39
00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:41.266
- Where's Min Kyu? - Upstairs. He'll be in the shower.

40
00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:43.967
Did you...

41
00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:45.506
He didn't find out.

42
00:03:46.737 --> 00:03:49.247
He promised not to bother me again.

43
00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.247
Are you okay?

44
00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:56.946
Take him home before the customers arrive.

45
00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:15.266
Hello?

46
00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.966
I'm on Geoje Island.

47
00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:18.836
Do you want anything?

48
00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:23.206
We're fine.

49
00:04:23.206 --> 00:04:26.177
Just come back to Seoul with Doctor Hong.

50
00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.747
Do you miss me that much?

51
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.357
Of course we do, brother.

52
00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:34.287
Get back here soon.

53
00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:38.826
I heard the yuzu bread is famous here. I'll get you some.

54
00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:41.696
And I heard it'll be cold tonight.

55
00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:43.867
You can all sleep in my house.

56
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.597
I bought more beddings. Okay?

57
00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:50.237
Brother!

58
00:04:53.477 --> 00:04:55.946
This is just so...

59
00:04:56.607 --> 00:04:58.917
Just get back here safely.

60
00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:04.687
You people are being punished in such odd ways.

61
00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:10.057
I shouldn't have...

62
00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:15.826
made such a promise.

63
00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:28.807
You look better than you did when you got here yesterday.

64
00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:31.776
Did you work out the misunderstanding?

65
00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:36.247
I need to work. What shall I do?

66
00:05:36.487 --> 00:05:39.187
The customers will start coming in soon.

67
00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:42.326
You were in the cold all night. Go get some rest.

68
00:05:43.287 --> 00:05:44.826
I want to work.

69
00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:46.227
Oh dear.

70
00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:53.497
Hello.

71
00:05:54.506 --> 00:05:57.136
Why? Today?

72
00:05:57.336 --> 00:05:58.836
How come?

73
00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.646
Okay, I'll come right over.

74
00:06:03.377 --> 00:06:04.776
Is something wrong?

75
00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:07.617
Old people tend to get into accidents in the winter.

76
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.187
I must go to the hospital.

77
00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:14.227
It's Hong Joo's.

78
00:06:14.287 --> 00:06:16.187
I can't do lunch today.

79
00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:18.756
Go eat somewhere else.

80
00:06:18.997 --> 00:06:21.466
All right. I called you, okay?

81
00:06:22.526 --> 00:06:24.336
I shouldn't be gone for long.

82
00:06:24.336 --> 00:06:27.566
Close the restaurant for me after your friends leave.

83
00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:30.307
- Take care. - I will.

84
00:06:41.747 --> 00:06:43.586
You've lost a lot of weight.

85
00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:47.456
There's nothing like a heartbreak to make you lose weight.

86
00:06:56.326 --> 00:06:57.466
Are you okay?

87
00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:02.336
- Yes. - Let's go back to Seoul.

88
00:07:02.737 --> 00:07:05.336
I need to tell you something about work.

89
00:07:05.836 --> 00:07:08.206
Then let's go to Seoul.

90
00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:23.526
I apologize, Hong Joo.

91
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.526
He won't do anything like this again.

92
00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:30.966
I trust you won't.

93
00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:34.367
You promised.

94
00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:37.506
I should go.

95
00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:52.487
Goodbye.

96
00:07:56.857 --> 00:07:57.896
Bye.

97
00:08:28.086 --> 00:08:30.787
Don't be silly. That's nonsense.

98
00:08:30.787 --> 00:08:32.727
- It's not nonsense, okay? - I'm starving to death.

99
00:08:32.727 --> 00:08:34.097
- Come on. - Okay.

100
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.127
You're such a joker.

101
00:08:36.127 --> 00:08:37.497
Ma'am.

102
00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:39.467
Ma'am, we're here.

103
00:08:39.837 --> 00:08:41.107
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

104
00:08:41.107 --> 00:08:44.607
She called to say she can't take you today.

105
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.707
No.

106
00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:47.506
We didn't get such a call.

107
00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:50.607
You can't cancel on the day. We never got the call.

108
00:08:50.607 --> 00:08:52.377
Is this your first day at work?

109
00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:54.487
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

110
00:08:54.487 --> 00:08:56.016
Skip the apology.

111
00:08:56.016 --> 00:08:58.656
We don't need anything extravagant. Just bring us food.

112
00:08:58.656 --> 00:09:00.087
Come on in, guys.

113
00:09:00.087 --> 00:09:03.227
What was the delay for? I'm starving.

114
00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:06.197
- Come on in. - Let's sit down.

115
00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:07.867
- Hey. - My goodness.

116
00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:09.627
- Anything will do. - I'm really sorry.

117
00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.467
There's no one to cook at the moment...

118
00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:13.636
Assorted sashimi,

119
00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:16.467
seafood stew, and seafood pajeon is on the menu.

120
00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:17.837
If that will do,

121
00:09:17.837 --> 00:09:20.436
please sit, and wait in silence.

122
00:09:20.436 --> 00:09:23.477
If you don't, you won't get any food, okay?

123
00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:26.176
- Just feed us anything. - We're starving.

124
00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:27.947
Get us some soju first.

125
00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:30.447
What are you doing?

126
00:09:30.447 --> 00:09:32.957
Get out. You promised.

127
00:09:32.957 --> 00:09:34.186
Can you cut sashimi?

128
00:09:34.286 --> 00:09:35.827
- No. - What about pajeon?

129
00:09:36.627 --> 00:09:38.127
No... No.

130
00:09:38.727 --> 00:09:39.957
I can.

131
00:09:40.727 --> 00:09:41.967
I'll leave right after this.

132
00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:47.097
Ji...

133
00:09:48.006 --> 00:09:50.006
Hong Joo, what should we do?

134
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.776
What... What should we do?

135
00:09:52.477 --> 00:09:55.806
Hong Joo can assist me. You two can serve. Okay?

136
00:09:55.806 --> 00:09:57.676
- Get moving. - We... We serve.

137
00:09:57.676 --> 00:09:59.377
Okay. Yes.

138
00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:20.567
Hello, Mr. Jo.

139
00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:21.737
Hello.

140
00:10:22.607 --> 00:10:24.207
Why did you call me?

141
00:10:24.737 --> 00:10:28.077
Why? Can I not because I'm no longer your CEO?

142
00:10:28.077 --> 00:10:30.947
No. Please go ahead.

143
00:10:30.947 --> 00:10:34.516
You have a younger sister.

144
00:10:35.546 --> 00:10:38.556
I think I saw her before.

145
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.487
What do you mean?

146
00:10:41.487 --> 00:10:43.087
It seems like...

147
00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:47.426
there are some people who look just like Aji 3.

148
00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:50.296
Your sister.

149
00:10:52.237 --> 00:10:54.036
Do you have anything to say?

150
00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:56.166
I think...

151
00:10:57.707 --> 00:10:59.577
there's a misunderstanding.

152
00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:04.717
My sister knows nothing about robots.

153
00:11:05.077 --> 00:11:08.817
Doctor Hong just made a robot based on her.

154
00:11:10.916 --> 00:11:13.416
Does your sister know nothing about this?

155
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.756
Yes.

156
00:11:16.756 --> 00:11:18.497
You don't know her well.

157
00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:20.597
What?

158
00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:22.567
I wonder why...

159
00:11:22.827 --> 00:11:26.036
Doctor Hong gave Aji 3...

160
00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.936
your sister's face.

161
00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:31.707
They used to know each other.

162
00:11:34.207 --> 00:11:35.646
It's true.

163
00:11:35.806 --> 00:11:38.447
My sister has nothing to do with this.

164
00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:01.136
Hong Joo, pass me a small plate.

165
00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:23.186
Pass them down the table.

166
00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:25.697
The food's here.

167
00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:38.906
Hong Joo.

168
00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:06.136
Here you go.

169
00:13:06.136 --> 00:13:08.666
- Try some. - You must have some.

170
00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:10.506
Gosh, the sashimi tastes great.

171
00:13:12.676 --> 00:13:14.877
- Let's go. - I'm full.

172
00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.146
That was good.

173
00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:17.146
Thank you.

174
00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:18.847
- We enjoyed that. - It was great.

175
00:13:18.847 --> 00:13:20.077
- See you later. - Thank you.

176

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

177
00:13:39.597 --> 00:13:41.006
There. We should...

178
00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:42.806
eat as well.

179
00:13:58.556 --> 00:13:59.756
Hong Joo.

180
00:13:59.957 --> 00:14:02.857
Is your surname Kim or Ji?

181
00:14:02.857 --> 00:14:06.197
I thought she was about to call you Ji Hong Joo.

182
00:14:07.357 --> 00:14:08.697
That was my mistake.

183
00:14:09.067 --> 00:14:10.426
She's Kim Hong Joo.

184
00:14:11.396 --> 00:14:12.467
Yes.

185
00:14:12.697 --> 00:14:14.067
Oh, Kim Hong Joo.

186
00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.837
Hong Joo, enjoy your meal.

187
00:14:18.676 --> 00:14:21.906
It'll be the first and last time you try my cooking.

188
00:14:24.207 --> 00:14:25.247
Eat up.

189
00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:31.587
Do you...

190
00:14:32.587 --> 00:14:33.656
like it?

191
00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:35.857
It's very good.

192
00:14:37.656 --> 00:14:38.957
Try this too.

193
00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:42.766
It's a seafood pajeon made with my mom's recipe.

194
00:14:56.776 --> 00:14:58.416
It's a work of art.

195
00:15:00.676 --> 00:15:01.686
And try this too.

196
00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:09.686
It's so good.

197
00:15:13.197 --> 00:15:15.526
I should've told Director Kim the truth.

198
00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:17.837
That Aji 3 has my sister's face,

199
00:15:17.837 --> 00:15:19.296
and that she dated Doctor Hong.

200
00:15:19.837 --> 00:15:21.136
I should've just told him.

201
00:15:22.806 --> 00:15:23.837
All right.

202
00:15:24.207 --> 00:15:25.837
Before things get out of hand,

203
00:15:26.306 --> 00:15:27.646
I'll have to tell him now.

204
00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:36.747
Hello?

205
00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:38.487
It's about Aji 3.

206
00:15:39.087 --> 00:15:41.256
I'll call you back. I'm eating right now.

207
00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:43.827
Okay.

208
00:15:53.997 --> 00:15:56.666
Why? Am I stuffing my face?

209
00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:58.107
No.

210
00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:00.806
I once wondered...

211
00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:04.947
how Aji 3 would feel if she could...

212
00:16:05.046 --> 00:16:06.447
try my cooking.

213
00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:11.016
I thought this must be how she'd feel.

214
00:16:18.396 --> 00:16:19.426
Right.

215
00:16:19.727 --> 00:16:21.967
Stop it before she gets sick.

216
00:16:23.097 --> 00:16:24.497
Sorry.

217
00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:26.097
It's fine.

218
00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:28.806
This will be your last time anyway.

219
00:16:33.377 --> 00:16:37.176
It was Mr. Hwang who resigned, not President Kim.

220
00:16:37.506 --> 00:16:39.347
You really think I wouldn't know?

221
00:16:39.877 --> 00:16:43.146
Things have been going wrong in unexpected ways.

222
00:16:44.656 --> 00:16:47.416
I have waited long enough.

223
00:16:47.827 --> 00:16:50.526
I am running out of patience.

224
00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:53.756
I'm going to send someone there myself.

225
00:16:54.296 --> 00:16:57.396
There's still more time until the date I promised.

226
00:16:57.737 --> 00:17:01.067
Please let us handle it just until then.

227
00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.007
Was that Martin?

228
00:17:09.007 --> 00:17:11.577
He found out that you resigned.

229
00:17:13.347 --> 00:17:14.646
Tell him...

230
00:17:15.317 --> 00:17:17.446
that I'll come back as a director.

231
00:17:18.156 --> 00:17:19.317
And you can...

232
00:17:19.817 --> 00:17:21.527
gather the board directors again.

233
00:17:23.087 --> 00:17:25.557
- What for? - Doctor Hong Baek Gyoon...

234
00:17:26.226 --> 00:17:28.027
and the Santa Maria team...

235
00:17:28.996 --> 00:17:30.896
had duped Kim Min Kyu.

236
00:17:31.597 --> 00:17:33.797
- What? - I wasn't the one...

237
00:17:34.906 --> 00:17:36.007
that should have resigned.

238
00:17:36.906 --> 00:17:38.507
It should've been Min Kyu.

239
00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:46.216
What's this?

240
00:17:47.047 --> 00:17:48.047
"Mon ami"?

241
00:17:48.486 --> 00:17:50.886
That's French for "my friend".

242
00:17:52.986 --> 00:17:54.886
Hoktal.

243
00:17:55.186 --> 00:17:57.827
I told you to check and delete it before.

244
00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:58.956
It's not mine.

245
00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:01.226
Then who made it?

246
00:18:01.226 --> 00:18:03.226
- It's not Doctor Hong's. - What?

247
00:18:03.867 --> 00:18:04.936
Then whose is it?

248
00:18:11.037 --> 00:18:12.077
Wait.

249
00:18:14.706 --> 00:18:15.777
Ssanip.

250
00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:17.206
Do you remember...

251
00:18:17.406 --> 00:18:19.976
when Aji 3 made her own backup folder last year?

252
00:18:19.976 --> 00:18:20.986
Yes.

253
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.686
That messed with all the deep-learning folders...

254
00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.416
we'd extracted patterns from, and it drove us crazy

255
00:18:26.817 --> 00:18:28.827
This robot made...

256
00:18:29.386 --> 00:18:31.057
her own backup folder?

257
00:18:31.057 --> 00:18:32.097
Just a moment.

258
00:18:32.327 --> 00:18:33.357
Aji 3.

259
00:18:33.896 --> 00:18:36.367
The Monami folder.

260
00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:38.867
Did you make it?

261
00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:40.837
Yes, I made it.

262
00:18:40.837 --> 00:18:41.906
Hey!!

263
00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:45.176
You can't keep bringing out folders we put in the trash.

264
00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:47.077
It wasn't from the trash.

265
00:18:47.077 --> 00:18:48.976
I saved it before the reset.

266
00:18:51.246 --> 00:18:53.246
Everything you did for me.

267
00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:57.246
The feelings.

268
00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:00.986
I'll remember them forever.

269
00:19:12.597 --> 00:19:13.696
What's that?

270
00:19:15.107 --> 00:19:17.537
Didn't we delete everything?

271
00:19:17.537 --> 00:19:21.146
Then the folder that got leaked...

272
00:19:21.906 --> 00:19:24.416
contains a video of our brother's deep-learning...

273
00:19:24.416 --> 00:19:26.617
What the heck.

274
00:19:26.617 --> 00:19:28.886
Brother? Kim Min Kyu?

275
00:19:30.047 --> 00:19:32.456
I kept the promise with my friend.

276
00:19:39.996 --> 00:19:41.896
(Overseas Travel)

277
00:19:41.926 --> 00:19:43.566
(East America)

278
00:19:45.396 --> 00:19:48.466
You finally got paid extra and can afford to go to the Alps.

279
00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:51.307
Why are you pouting like a child?

280
00:19:51.307 --> 00:19:54.507
The Alps isn't the problem right now, Uncle.

281
00:19:55.406 --> 00:19:56.577
Then what is?

282
00:19:56.577 --> 00:19:57.646
She...

283
00:19:59.216 --> 00:20:01.617
wanted to know what kind of person I was.

284
00:20:02.146 --> 00:20:03.146
Who did?

285
00:20:06.087 --> 00:20:07.757
Who are you?

286
00:20:08.057 --> 00:20:09.827
I want to know about you too.

287
00:20:11.496 --> 00:20:14.196
No one had ever said that to me.

288
00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:16.097
Didn't I ever say that to you?

289
00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:26.777
We should go before sunset.

290
00:20:30.507 --> 00:20:31.716
Min Kyu.

291
00:20:33.377 --> 00:20:36.386
We all ate. Shouldn't we do the dishes too?

292
00:20:37.186 --> 00:20:39.757
It's okay, I'll do it. I'm strong.

293
00:20:40.087 --> 00:20:41.257
Then would you do this with me?

294
00:20:41.587 --> 00:20:43.486
No, no, I'll do it.

295
00:20:43.486 --> 00:20:44.696
Let me help.

296
00:20:44.696 --> 00:20:47.097
Hong Joo, take her outside. She's a nuisance.

297
00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:52.666
Let's go.

298
00:20:57.436 --> 00:20:59.636
You couldn't take the hint.

299
00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:01.807
You could've just let me and Hong Joo do it.

300
00:21:02.877 --> 00:21:04.476
How uncomfortable would she feel?

301
00:21:04.476 --> 00:21:07.277
You'd have stared at her while you did all these dishes.

302
00:21:08.287 --> 00:21:10.886
When I look at her, my heart...

303
00:21:13.386 --> 00:21:15.757
It beats fast like when I saw Aji 3.

304
00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:20.156
I become excited, itchy, and happy.

305
00:21:20.627 --> 00:21:24.127
I want to see more of her. What am I supposed to do?

306
00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:27.367
And I find it strange...

307
00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:30.206
to feel...

308
00:21:31.577 --> 00:21:32.936
that my connection with her...

309
00:21:33.706 --> 00:21:35.107
won't end here.

310
00:21:36.976 --> 00:21:40.517
I think there will be a next time and something more.

311
00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:44.956
Isn't that strange?

312
00:21:52.527 --> 00:21:54.896
While I was locked up with him,

313
00:21:56.097 --> 00:21:58.466
I was really scared that he might find out,

314
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.466
but I was also happy.

315
00:22:05.436 --> 00:22:06.577
However,

316
00:22:08.047 --> 00:22:10.547
I slowly started to become greedy.

317
00:22:12.277 --> 00:22:14.347
I thought maybe he might...

318
00:22:15.686 --> 00:22:18.956
forgive me and trust me if I told him the truth...

319
00:22:20.317 --> 00:22:23.127
since he likes me so much.

320
00:22:26.656 --> 00:22:28.567
Since I started to become greedy,

321
00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:31.466
it got a little difficult towards the end.

322
00:22:34.466 --> 00:22:35.466
But...

323
00:22:38.277 --> 00:22:40.176
that can't happen, right?

324
00:22:57.027 --> 00:22:58.097
It's...

325
00:23:00.057 --> 00:23:01.966
really goodbye now.

326
00:23:12.236 --> 00:23:14.246
I really enjoyed the meal...

327
00:23:14.807 --> 00:23:16.377
you made.

328
00:23:19.117 --> 00:23:22.117
Then let's be friends.

329
00:23:25.617 --> 00:23:28.656
You promised that you'll never show up before me again.

330
00:23:29.226 --> 00:23:30.527
You must keep that promise.

331
00:23:34.327 --> 00:23:35.466
But...

332
00:23:36.127 --> 00:23:37.636
why do I feel like...

333
00:23:38.736 --> 00:23:40.337
we're going to meet again?

334
00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:45.337
That's not going to happen.

335
00:23:47.136 --> 00:23:48.406
It never will.

336
00:25:14.867 --> 00:25:17.896
You promised that you'll never show up before me again.

337
00:25:18.537 --> 00:25:19.837
You must keep that promise.

338
00:25:22.837 --> 00:25:23.936
But...

339
00:25:24.636 --> 00:25:25.837
why do I feel like...

340
00:25:27.206 --> 00:25:28.746
we're going to meet again?

341
00:25:34.547 --> 00:25:36.746
That's not going to happen.

342
00:25:38.587 --> 00:25:39.857
It never will.

343
00:25:44.527 --> 00:25:45.597
Here.

344
00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:47.357
Do you have an upset stomach?

345
00:25:47.357 --> 00:25:49.396
I'll be fine if I take medicine.

346
00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:55.706
Yes?

347
00:25:57.367 --> 00:25:58.377
What?

348
00:25:59.007 --> 00:26:01.406
What are you saying? Be more specific.

349
00:26:03.706 --> 00:26:05.317
What should we do?

350
00:26:06.246 --> 00:26:10.347
We never imagined that Aji 3 would've done such a thing.

351
00:26:11.357 --> 00:26:12.686
We're on our way back to Seoul.

352
00:26:12.686 --> 00:26:15.127
So I want you to check how much of the video got leaked.

353
00:26:15.926 --> 00:26:16.956
What happened?

354
00:26:16.956 --> 00:26:19.557
Aji 3 had saved a backup file of Min Kyu's deep learning process.

355
00:26:19.726 --> 00:26:21.726
- What? - We need to hurry.

356
00:26:22.426 --> 00:26:23.466
Okay.

357
00:26:28.736 --> 00:26:30.067
Where did he go?

358
00:26:33.307 --> 00:26:34.377
Come in.

359
00:26:40.877 --> 00:26:41.916
Hey.

360
00:26:46.886 --> 00:26:48.857
Yoo Cheol showed me everything already.

361
00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:51.327
He's starting to think smart now.

362
00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:54.367
Something additional came out, and I looked into it.

363
00:26:54.767 --> 00:26:56.396
It's something very interesting.

364
00:26:56.726 --> 00:26:59.067
- What? - Director Kim...

365
00:26:59.537 --> 00:27:01.037
had an illness.

366
00:27:01.236 --> 00:27:04.236
It was crucial enough for him to get dismissed from his position.

367
00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:12.076
(Hong Joo's)

368
00:27:30.797 --> 00:27:32.567
The owner's not there right now.

369
00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:35.837
I'm looking for a young woman.

370
00:27:35.837 --> 00:27:38.406
She's about this tall, and she has short hair.

371
00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:41.146
She packed her bags and left.

372
00:27:41.377 --> 00:27:43.807
What? She... She left?

373
00:27:44.617 --> 00:27:46.017
When? Where did she go?

374
00:27:46.017 --> 00:27:48.216
She just left. She went this way.

375
00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:49.847
I think she left about five minutes ago.

376
00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:02.797
I'm pretty sure he went back to the sashimi restaurant.

377
00:29:21.877 --> 00:29:23.377
I finally found her.

378
00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:53.037
That... That's...

379
00:29:55.277 --> 00:29:59.347
That's the necklace I gave to Aji 3.

380
00:30:25.476 --> 00:30:28.646
Let... Let me explain everything.

381
00:30:36.317 --> 00:30:37.446
Have you been...

382
00:30:40.017 --> 00:30:42.926
lying to me this whole time?

383
00:30:56.666 --> 00:30:58.507
I feel like I'm going to throw up.
