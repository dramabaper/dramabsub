1
00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:06.911
In a moment,

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.781
the bamboo house floods and Cho Rong gets injured.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.810
Byung Man's Tribe is in a crisis.

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.250
However, the survival must continue.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.221
They recharge themselves...

6
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:20.221
and separate into three teams to explore.

7
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.660
Byung Man's Tribe comes across the wonderful Mother Nature...

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.191
that can be only witnessed in Taveuni Island.

9
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.831
And what is this gigantic fish they find in the sea?

10
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:35.870
The Law of Jungle in Fiji, the eighth story. Let's get started.

11
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:39.711
We're going to divide into teams.

12
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.070
Let's divide up. We have to find food.

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.080
He's right.

14
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:47.250
Everything's in the island. We've gone to the waterfall...

15
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.750
We haven't been to too many places.

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.051
I think we've only been to the waterfall.

17
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.220
We wanted to check out all the locations,

18
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.091
so let's divide up and move.

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.390
It's raining so much. Can we still go?

20
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.260
That's why we're going far to where it didn't rain.

21
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.430
We have to survive somehow,

22
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.530
so Yun Hyeong and I'll go out to the sea to fish.

23
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.301
- Is that okay? - Yes. We'll try.

24
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.900
- Really? - You're fishing in this weather?

25
00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.040
We have no choice. We have to catch something.

26
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.840
Isn't it easier to fish when it's raining?

27
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:18.411
- Please be careful. - Come back if it's not safe.

28
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.650
- Please be careful. - Please be safe.

29
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.650
See you later.

30
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.351
- You can do it. - See you later.

31
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.650
- Why is it raining more now? - You can do it.

32
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.721
(It's raining more now.)

33
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:28.721
This way, Bo Mi.

34
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.090
Wherever we go, the rain always follows us,

35
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.131
so ours fans call us Rain Pink.

36
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.601
You know it rained every day since our arrival in Fiji?

37
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:43.570
When we were getting on the boat, it rained a little bit too.

38
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.971
It wasn't intentional,

39
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.211
but I'm sorry for the trouble.

40
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:53.251
We won't come again.

41
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.180
- Please take care. - These are the new members.

42
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.180
Please follow me.

43
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.920
We became close already.

44
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.191
I'm getting teary.

45
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.430
It keeps on raining.

46
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.030
Are we able...

47
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.701
to go elsewhere?

48
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.231
- I think there's something. - This way.

49
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.671
- What? - I think there's something.

50
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:16.201
(Moon Sik finds something.)

51
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.571
- What? - What's there?

52
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.741
- Check it out. - Be careful.

53
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.680
(What is it?)

54
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.981
It's a turtle.

55
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.310
- Where? - It's a turtle.

56
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:31.081
Hurry up. It's a turtle.

57
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:32.680
(They find a green sea turtle.)

58
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:35.090
Come here. It's a turtle.

59
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:36.560
Oh, dear.

60
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.620
Look.

61
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.030
(They're fascinated.)

62
00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.201
Turtles symbolize luck.

63
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:44.400
- Exactly. - Really?

64
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.930
They do.

65
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.000
- They're a symbol of longevity. - I think we'll do well.

66
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:52.041
(Here and there)

67
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.970
(Roaming)

68
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.541
(It hurries up.)

69
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.310
Bye.

70
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.981
Be happy.

71
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.650
It's not easy to spot turtles in the jungle.

72
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.921
- Really? - This is luck.

73
00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:08.791
- Yes, something good will happen. - We'll get lucky.

74
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.961
- It's still there, right? - I see it.

75
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.530
- There. - It's so cute.

76
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:16.560
(Good luck, Byung Man's Tribe.)

77
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.731
It's checking to see if we left.

78
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.400
I have a good feeling.

79
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.470
(They get going again with hopes of getting lucky.)

80
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.211
We saw so many cool things.

81
00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:29.741
(They're happy.)

82
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.081
This is magnificent.

83
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.850
Look at that.

84
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.310
(They find something again.)

85
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.120
- What is that? It's like a map. - It's pretty.

86
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.321
Where is this? I feel like I've seen this on our map.

87
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.361
It looks like a comet dropped.

88
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.430
- Mushroom? - Mushroom Rock?

89
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.491
(It's marked as Mushroom Rock on their map.)

90
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:50.331
- There's a Mushroom Rock? - Yes.

91
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.030
Mushroom Rock?

92
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.970
(Taveuni Island was built from an eruption of lava flow.)

93
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.970
The rocks look awesome.

94
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:58.470
- I thought it was cement... - Really?

95
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:02.241
- when I saw it from far away. - There's space on the ground.

96
00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:05.081
The one closest to us looks most like mushroom.

97
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.650
I want to eat mushrooms.

98
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.410
(She has a great appetite.)

99
00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:12.821
- "I want to eat mushrooms." - So these are the Mushroom Rocks.

100
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.021
It looks nice. From far away, it looks like they constructed it.

101
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:19.831
Rocks near beaches have unique colors. They're black.

102
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:21.790
- We usually don't see black rocks. - That's true.

103
00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:22.900
They look amazing.

104
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.860
- I wonder how much time passed. - I know, right?

105
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.071
They have a lot of nice little areas.

106
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.040
You can easily miss them.

107
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.211
(Tae Gon and Yun Hyeong reach the Mushroom Rocks as well.)

108
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:39.511
They're huge.

109
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280
This is amazing.

110
00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:45.881
(It's a great shelter from the rain.)

111
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:47.321
This is perfect.

112
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:49.660
I've never seen rocks like these.

113
00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:53.030
They're so black.

114
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.230
They're so interesting.

115
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.431
(This is art that's been made over time.)

116
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:57.701
How do they stay like that?

117
00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.730
The waves are rougher here.

118
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.141
I think they get sharpened by the waves and get smooth.

119
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.271
- This is big. - What is it?

120
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.110
See? There are conches. Let me see.

121
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.980
- It's full. - It is full. Let's take this.

122
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.381
- We have to take this. - For sure.

123
00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:16.751
They're here.

124
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.590
- It's heavy. - We can take 10 conches back.

125
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.590
(I hope we can take 10 conches back.)

126
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.290
If we have 10 of them, we'll have a good meal.

127
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.290
Right?

128
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.331
Isn't this it?

129
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.100
(He pops it out.)

130
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:35.030
(Giggling)

131
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.600
- Give me a high-five. - Look.

132
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.670
This must be big.

133
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.170
- We have to crack it open. - Right.

134
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.480
Let's cook it. This is great. Awesome.

135
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.211
I got another one.

136
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.121
- What's this? - This looks edible.

137
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:52.181
It's edible.

138
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:54.350
You have a good eye.

139
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.550
(You're good at finding them.)

140
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.561
You're incredible.

141
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.561
(It's really in there.)

142
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.530
- You have to go fishing with me. - Okay.

143
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.730
You have to go with me.

144
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.100
(Tae Gon is a great fisherman and Yun Hyeong has a good eye.)

145
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.931
Are there fish here then?

146
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.170
There must be.

147
00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:09.641
We just have to go out into the sea.

148
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.970
Meanwhile, Kang Nam and Jin Woon set out to explore the waterfall.

149
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.381
I'm embarrassed of myself. What do I do?

150
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.040
- I'm kind of embarrassed too. - Right? Both you and me.

151
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:20.850
I'm embarrassed of myself this time.

152
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.821
- I didn't even catch a shrimp. - You didn't?

153
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:23.881
No.

154
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:26.391
We have to keep trying.

155
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.951
I have a good feeling. We're so motivated.

156
00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:31.391
(He hurries up.)

157
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.230
You're going faster now.

158
00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:36.431
- Pardon? - You're going faster.

159
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:40.001
We have to go fast and catch something.

160
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:42.431
We have to show the power of young people.

161
00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:45.800
We might find coconut crabs on the way.

162
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.441
- Let's show them. - Right. It's time.

163
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:50.941
Here?

164
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.740
Fishing?

165
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.751
(Locals say this is a good location to fish.)

166
00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:58.181
The current is so strong.

167
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.691
When the current is strong, eels swim to the edges.

168
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.420
- We might be able to catch them. - From the edges?

169
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:07.090
- Let's try it. - Let's try.

170
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.860
We can do it. Let's go.

171
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.030
Okay, let's go.

172
00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:11.530
- Go, go. - Let's catch it.

173
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:14.170
- I think we can do it from here. - From here?

174
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.530
Let's do it here.

175
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.800
(They get into position...)

176
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.201
(and hook a bait.)

177
00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:20.311
Okay.

178
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:22.910
- Isn't this good? - Yes.

179
00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:24.881
Keep looking.

180
00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:29.850
At the same time, Moon Sik's team is looking for a water slide.

181
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:31.850
They follow the valley.

182
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.650
Fiji is just full of water.

183
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.561
- It's water and rain. - It's always raining.

184
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.730
The rain is not stopping.

185
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:44.660
Be careful here.

186
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.331
(They follow the narrow valley upstream.)

187
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:50.900
It's falling towards here.

188
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.410
Is this the water slide?

189
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.181
It starts from the top.

190
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.150
- It's made by nature. - It looks amazing.

191
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.220
I approve this. Water is so clear.

192
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:14.191
Water slide. Welcome to the water slide.

193
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:15.961
Oh, my.

194
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.800
Where does this end?

195
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:21.371
Where does it end?

196
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.170
Would you like to try?

197
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.670
- Should I try? - Will you?

198
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:27.840
I'll give it a try.

199
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.040
(Okay, let's do this.)

200
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.040
(He's the first one to go on the water slide.)

201
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.480
We came this far. We have to try it out.

202
00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:37.921
- Be careful, Moon Sik. - Use your left hand.

203
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:42.090
(He crosses the valley to get to the starting point.)

204
00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:45.291
(He takes big strides.)

205
00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:49.931
I was raised in the rural area,

206
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:52.031
and locals do this as well.

207
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:55.130
I was getting excited. Let's do this.

208
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.740
From the top?

209
00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:00.370
- You can do it. - Okay.

210
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.270
(You can do it, Moon Sik.)

211
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.510
(You are the best.)

212
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.781
(He reaches the starting point.)

213
00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.020
How do you feel right now?

214
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:13.691
I'm getting nervous for some reason.

215
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.691
I won't die, right?

216
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.691
(He's so cool about it.)

217
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.161
(He gets ready to go in.)

218
00:09:24.701 --> 00:09:29.500
(The real man gets on the water slide.)

219
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.041
He's coming.

220
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.811
- Let's go, Moon Sik! - Let's go!

221
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:42.510
(He starts as the other members cheer him on.)

222
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:46.321
(Let's go, water slide.)

223
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.260
(The stream is so refreshing.)

224
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.860
(Sliding)

225
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.431
(This is full of thrill.)

226
00:10:00.431 --> 00:10:02.870
(The water quality is great too.)

227
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.211
(This section accelerates.)

228
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.510
(Exclaiming)

229
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.350
(He's so excited.)

230
00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:22.020
(He was sliding down fast and the water splashed on him.)

231
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.620
(He lost his cap.)

232
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.061
(He had a successful attempt on the refreshing water slide.)

233
00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:30.701
You were awesome.

234
00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:34.130
(He's amazing.)

235
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.640
It leaves you flustered.

236
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.740
It's fun.

237
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.740
(It's still fun.)

238
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.980
- This... - It was fun?

239
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:44.541
- It was. - Really?

240
00:10:44.681 --> 00:10:45.781
Is the water cold?

241
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.451
Kind of. But if...

242
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.620
you submerge yourself in the water, it's not that cold.

243
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:51.821
It's just cold in the beginning.

244
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:55.151
I'm scared. I'm scared, Dam.

245
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.961
- A little bit. - Which one was the most fun?

246
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:59.860
Last one and the one behind it.

247
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.230
- This area? - Yes.

248
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:02.590
I'm scared.

249
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:06.171
Don't do it if you're scared. You don't have to do it.

250
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:07.301
You wanted to try it?

251
00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:09.901
Be careful here.

252
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.870
(Bo Mi crosses the water to get to the starting point.)

253
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.840
(She's unstable.)

254
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.510
(She crosses to the other slide slowly.)

255
00:11:21.051 --> 00:11:22.281
My legs are shaking.

256
00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:25.421
(She walks towards upstream.)

257
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:27.250
It's so strong.

258
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.061
- The current is stronger now. - It's strong.

259
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:35.860
(The current is murkier and faster than earlier.)

260
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:43.500
(20 minutes ago and now)

261
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.140
I was shocked.

262
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:52.010
I wanted to try it,

263
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.811
but the current grew stronger.

264
00:11:54.811 --> 00:11:55.911
(Just when she was about to try, the water grew in size.)

265
00:11:55.911 --> 00:11:58.620
I got scared. I couldn't even dip my foot in.

266
00:11:58.681 --> 00:12:00.151
The current was so strong.

267
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.291
Bo Mi, it's too dangerous to try.

268
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:07.431
The water grew.

269
00:12:07.431 --> 00:12:09.600
(The current is growing in strength.)

270
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:13.970
(Bo Mi tries to go back.)

271
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.031
It's scarier now.

272
00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:18.071
Be careful.

273
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:21.140
(She hesitates because the water is so fast.)

274
00:12:23.281 --> 00:12:26.281
The water grew stronger. It got stronger.

275
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.921
(She clenches her teeth and tries again.)

276
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.990
(She's scared.)

277
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:44.061
(She returns safely.)

278
00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:46.531
- Good job. - Good job.

279
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:49.230
My goodness. It's so strong.

280
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.941
- The water grew stronger. - There's more water.

281
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:52.941
(The staffs have to come back too.)

282
00:12:52.941 --> 00:12:54.870
The rain is traveling down.

283
00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:57.010
It's different from earlier.

284
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.480
Give me the camera first.

285
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:03.781
Take this.

286
00:13:03.781 --> 00:13:07.590
(Local help them hand over the camera.)

287
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.860
The water's strong. It's muddy.

288
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.860
Be careful.

289
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.860
(I'm safe now.)

290
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:18.831
We're good.

291
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.230
- It's still raining, right? - Yes.

292
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.331
(It keeps on raining and they're helpless.)

293
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:24.671
The water grew in size all of a sudden.

294
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:27.640
It must be dangerous elsewhere too.

295
00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:29.581
I think we should go down and check out the situation.

296
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.740
- We're up here so we can't tell. - Let's go down and check.

297
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:38.220
The water changed all of a sudden and they leave the valley.

298
00:13:39.081 --> 00:13:41.620
I hope the rest of Byung Man's Tribe is safe.

299
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.191
- Hold on. - Help her.

300
00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.431
- I can feel it. - You can?

301
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.531
- Yes. - You can feel it?

302
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:48.531
(Kang Nam and Jin Woon are still fishing downstream.)

303
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.901
- I can feel it bite. - You can?

304
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.201
- It must be the water current. - Look.

305
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.901
- This is the current? - It is.

306
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.980
- This is the current? - If it bites, it'll be obvious.

307
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.081
- I didn't catch anything. - Would we catch anything?

308
00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:11.451
- The water current is too strong. - Right.

309
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:14.720
(We have to show them something.)

310
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.421
Hold on. This is raining too much.

311
00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:21.461
(The water is seeping in.)

312
00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:27.031
(The water speed picked up and the water level is higher.)

313
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.201
This is scary.

314
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.470
(It looks like the rock might get pulled out.)

315
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.071
We have to evacuate.

316
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.380
(Let's get away from here.)

317
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.010
The water grew too much. There was no water here earlier.

318
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.281
It's filling up now.

319
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:45.350
Let's go. Come out.

320
00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:48.750
(The water looks angry.)

321
00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:51.061
Let's go, Jin Woon.

322
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.831
Hurry up, Director.

323
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.061
- Hurry up. - It's dangerous.

324
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.860
- Sir. - Director.

325
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.161
- We're not joking. - It's really dangerous. Hurry.

326
00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.431
(They need to get back to their shelter quickly and safely.)

327
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:03.770
- The water grew so much. - This is no joke.

328
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.041
(They need to get back to their shelter quickly and safely.)

329
00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:06.211
What about the other members?

330
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.281
- We have to go here. - We can't cross.

331
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.581
No way.

332
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.181
What's wrong?

333
00:15:16.051 --> 00:15:17.620
- Whenever we try to do something... - How do we cross?

334
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:20.421
What's wrong this time?

335
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.490
(The rope they tied up yesterday is submerged now.)

336
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.260
This is not a joke.

337
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.090
If this continues, our shelter is in danger.

338
00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:30.901
- Let's go and see. - Okay.

339
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:34.000
There's nothing we can do.

340
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:40.571
(Their shelter is about to get flooded.)

341
00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:44.081
(The rain keeps on pouring.)

342
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.551
It's going to rain for about six more hours.

343
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:50.220
From now on.

344
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:54.350
(Staff informs Byung Man's Tribe about the situation.)

345
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.191
Your shelter and the entire area will...

346
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:00.390
get flooded tonight.

347
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.360
- They'll get flooded? - If this continues.

348
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.401
Our shelter is near the river.

349
00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:08.831
- Is that why? - During high tide,

350
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.870
water from that side...

351
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:13.071
- It reaches here? - They get sent here.

352
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:14.140
That's possible.

353
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.681
For your next survival, we have to evacuate.

354
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.681
- Evacuate? - We're leaving completely?

355
00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:24.051
(It's always safety first.)

356
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:25.350
We'll be in trouble. Let's leave then.

357
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.691
Let's evacuate right away.

358
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:31.291
Let's go.

359
00:16:32.461 --> 00:16:34.461
Due to the unexpected rainfall,

360
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.161
staff decides to evacuate.

361
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.970
I wonder if Tae Gon and Yun Hyeong are okay.

362
00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:42.031
They better get back fast.

363
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.071
Byung Man's Tribe packs up...

364
00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:48.441
before their shelter gets flooded and gets ready to evacuate.

365
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.281
Tae Gon and Yun Hyeong were planning to go finishing...

366
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.610
out in the sea, but their legs are bound.

367
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.520
- The weather is so bad. - I know.

368
00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.720
Please get back.

369
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.720
(They're powerless in front of nature.)

370
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:04.691
It was raining so much and the temperature dropped.

371
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:06.461
We got so cold.

372
00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:10.530
We were getting symptoms of hypothermia.

373
00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:14.931
For me, I was reaching an extreme situation.

374
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:19.070
Base camp, can you hear me?

375
00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:22.671
The waves are rough and it keeps on raining, so we can't go on a boat.

376
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:24.080
Please tell me your situation.

377
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.381
It's raining a lot here too. There's too much water,

378
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:32.651
so we're planning to evacuate.

379
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.290
Please evacuate.

380
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.921
Filming is important, but this is a dangerous situation,

381
00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:40.631
so we're going to evacuate as fast as possible.

382
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.830
Let's go.

383
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.760
My goodness.

384
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.631
This is a bad situation.

385
00:17:49.841 --> 00:17:52.300
The staff evacuated the Tribe into a safe place...

386
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.671
and started their emergency meeting to come up with a plan.

387
00:17:54.671 --> 00:17:55.770
(The staff's emergency meeting)

388
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040
Would that be a better plan?

389
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.141
The problem is that it might rain more heavily,

390
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.411
and we might not be able to get out even next morning.

391
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.191
We should stay put for the night, and tomorrow morning...

392
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.820
Since it's not easy to move to another place,

393
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.220
they will spend the night at the base camp.

394
00:18:10.391 --> 00:18:12.961
They decided to wait and see the weather tomorrow morning.

395
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.361
When I was told suddenly that we had to pull out,

396
00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:19.260
I was really surprised.

397
00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:22.330
The water kept on flooding in.

398
00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:25.240
The house we built was about to submerge too.

399
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.240
(It was vulnerable against the rain.)

400
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.480
It rained so much that we couldn't handle it.

401
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240
It was like...

402
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.651
we didn't have a choice. We were trying to save ourselves.

403
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:37.580
I thought we were in big trouble.

404
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.490
It was pouring down, and I knew it would be flooding soon.

405
00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:43.621
When I heard that we were pulling out,

406
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:44.921
I was relieved.

407
00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:47.760
I was scared. The moment I saw it, I was frightened.

408
00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.361
I learned how dangerous it could be.

409
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.470
I think nature can be very scary.

410
00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:58.770
To humans, nature can be an abundance of life,

411
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.941
but it can be endlessly cold-hearted at the same time.

412
00:19:01.871 --> 00:19:05.141
A true law of jungle that we mustn't forget is to adapt ourselves...

413
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.881
to Mother Nature instead of fighting against it.

414
00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:14.921
However, like yesterday was a nightmare, it's sunny the next day.

415
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:16.790
The Tribe has been through a lot.

416
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.990
Putting their survival behind them, they split into three teams...

417
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.560
and venture out to explore the Garden of Spirits.

418
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.361
The Tribe sets out to find Mother Nature such as coral sea and...

419
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.171
the scenery on the coast that can be only seen in Taveuni Island.

420
00:19:29.171 --> 00:19:30.401
(Thumbs up)

421
00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:34.240
How will the Garden of Spirits, they will come face to face with, look?

422
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.841
(The day of exploration starts!)

423
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.780
(Taveuni Island, the morning of day 3)

424
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.851
(He's getting ready in a hurry.)

425
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:43.621
- How do you feel? - How do I feel?

426
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:46.391
It must be the weather clearing up.

427
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:48.151
I feel...

428
00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:49.391
(It's sunny in the Garden.)

429
00:19:49.391 --> 00:19:50.560
so much better all of a sudden.

430
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:52.361
I feel great.

431
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.891
I want to catch a spearfish today.

432
00:19:57.431 --> 00:19:59.330
I'd like to feel it with my body.

433
00:20:00.201 --> 00:20:02.371
Spearfish requires more than my hands to pull it up.

434
00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:03.770
(Is there a reason for his confidence?)

435
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.211
I actually told this to Dam too. I have a feeling that...

436
00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:11.941
I'm getting lucky when it comes to fishing these days.

437
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.810
I told him unlike before, I'm catching a lot of fish...

438
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:17.681
and that I can catch whatever fish I want.

439
00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.720
(Trophies of his fishing in 2017)

440
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:21.621
I told him if I'm lucky, I'll be able to catch a spearfish.

441
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:24.060
In front of the sea in Taveuni Island,

442
00:20:24.191 --> 00:20:26.691
there's a famous fishing point for spearfish.

443
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.000
Are you sure we'll be able to see these spearfish today?

444
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.970
Whether it's me or Dam, whoever it is, if one of us is pulling...

445
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.270
out a spearfish, the other one must hold from the back.

446
00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:37.901
Let's try it.

447
00:20:37.901 --> 00:20:39.070
- This is it. - It's coming.

448
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.441
(Since spearfish tend to be huge, it might be a tough struggle.)

449
00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:43.240
(They have a shot if 2 of them go at 1 spearfish.)

450
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.750
- Let's go. - Let's go.

451
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:47.881
Gosh, I'm nervous.

452
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.580
I can't wait.

453
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:51.451
(They get on the fishing boat.)

454
00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:53.320
There's no middle ground here.

455
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.451
Either it's pouring...

456
00:20:54.451 --> 00:20:57.461
- Right. Either it rains... - or it's extremely sunny.

457
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.820
What's your name?

458
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.490
- It's Jake. Hi. - Jake?

459
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.691
(A spearfish expert accompanies them.)

460
00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:03.760
Jake!

461
00:21:04.461 --> 00:21:05.800
I believe in you!

462
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.800
(His desperation takes over.)

463
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.371
Spearfish! I don't know the word for it in English.

464
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:10.841
(Look forward to see Jake's amazing performance.)

465
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:11.841
(Fishing is all about the energy.)

466
00:21:11.841 --> 00:21:13.240
Spearfish!

467
00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:16.181
(The atmosphere is good, and so is the weather.)

468
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:18.540
I want to catch a spearfish!

469
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.151
(It's a perfect departure.)

470
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:24.921
My gosh, the color of the water is fantastic. It's spearfish's color.

471
00:21:24.921 --> 00:21:26.421
Wait. Do spearfish live in the blue water?

472
00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:27.651
This is the color of the spearfish.

473
00:21:27.651 --> 00:21:28.990
(He meant to say he was feeling great.)

474
00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:32.931
Tae Gon, you played a lot of roles for kings.

475
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.591
You're going to be the king of the sea, Jang Bogo.

476
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.461
You're Jang Bogo today, okay?

477
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:39.730
Get the energy from Jang Bogo.

478
00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:41.730
Catch the spearfish!

479
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:42.730
(Here comes the king, Tae Gon.)

480
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.000
Come out!

481
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.911
(Come out, spearfish!)

482
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:49.240
Come out!

483
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.780
(Lee Tae Gon, the king of the sea)

484
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.510
I guess we arrived.

485
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.151
I guess this is it.

486
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.451
Is it here?

487
00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:57.921
Yes! It's here!

488
00:21:58.121 --> 00:21:59.451
I'm ready!

489
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.560
(He throws the fishing lure into the water right away.)

490
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.830
(He unwinds the fishing reel.)

491
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.560
(Everything is set for them to fish.)

492
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:11.701
Look. It's sunny now.

493
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.101
- Sweet. - The weather is great.

494
00:22:13.171 --> 00:22:16.201
Everything is going according to just like how you predicted.

495
00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:18.871
- The sun is up! - Oh, spirits.

496
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:20.411
Spirits!

497
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:22.411
Please let us catch spearfish!

498
00:22:22.411 --> 00:22:23.540
(Please grant us spearfish!)

499
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.641
Spirits.

500
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:28.181
- Are we fishing like this? - Yes.

501
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.881
- We already started? - Yes, we did.

502
00:22:30.151 --> 00:22:31.151
I didn't know.

503
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:32.851
We're going to circle around here just like this.

504
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:35.621
(Trolling is a method of attracting fish as they drag fishing lures.)

505
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:37.760
First off, the sound of engine makes them...

506
00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:40.861
curious because there's a noise.

507
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.691
They feel the sound wave.

508
00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:45.730
They'd be curious. When they look at the boat, they see the lures.

509
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.201
When we do this, look at the boat.

510
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.270
- I see. - The boat makes the sea foam.

511
00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:53.470
The sea foam deceive the fish, and we take advance of that.

512
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.841
(Tae Gon checks the time all of a sudden.)

513
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.550
The sea is at low tide right now. It's time for the low tide.

514
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.851
(He looks trustworthy with his arms crossed.)

515
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:04.881
(It's when the tides begin to ebb away.)

516
00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:06.790
It's beginning of the low tide.

517
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:09.220
The water is starting to ebb away little by little.

518
00:23:10.621 --> 00:23:12.591
When that happens, do the fish move together?

519
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.530
When the tides switch from rising to ebbing away,

520
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.601
it's easier to catch fish.

521
00:23:17.601 --> 00:23:18.760
(During that time, fish are more active.)

522
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.931
It happens when the tides are shifting.

523
00:23:20.431 --> 00:23:24.701
It's been about an hour since the tides began to outflow.

524
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.441
The tides are on our side.

525
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:31.980
(It's true that he's reliable, but...)

526
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.651
We are trolling, but the lines are on the side.

527
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.151
You know how all the handles are located on the right?

528
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:39.220
(Even when we fast forward 10 times faster, he never stops.)

529
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.451
(I'm as talkative as Yu Jae Seok on the fishing boat.)

530
00:23:41.451 --> 00:23:44.290
This is the most I've seen him talk out of all the interviews he had.

531
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.290
- You're referring to Tae Gon? - Yes.

532
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.431
He can talk for days when it's about fishing.

533
00:23:49.601 --> 00:23:52.500
(These are 3 forbidden topics in Korea.)

534
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.300
(They are military, soccer, and fishing.)

535
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.240
A fish should be biting the lure about now.

536
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.800
(The fish are the only thing that can stop him from talking.)

537
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.371
Looking at the waves, it's about time we heard something.

538
00:24:02.371 --> 00:24:05.310
(Oh, spirits. Please make him stop talking.)

539
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.711
Hey, the weather is amazing here.

540
00:24:07.711 --> 00:24:09.451
- My gosh. - The color of the sea is so blue.

541
00:24:10.121 --> 00:24:12.020
The color of the sea is emerald.

542
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.421
(Where?)

543
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:16.421
- I see. That's pretty. - What a picturesque view.

544
00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:18.921
It's so pretty.

545
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:21.131
(The sea is youthful and fresh like them.)

546
00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:22.931
The weather was amazing.

547
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:25.101
The three of us had so much fun at that time.

548
00:24:25.961 --> 00:24:29.371
We felt peaceful which was something we couldn't feel for a while there.

549
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.570
We were so happy to see the beautiful sea.

550
00:24:31.841 --> 00:24:32.841
This is the real side of Fiji.

551
00:24:35.111 --> 00:24:37.681
I can see everything. This is incredible.

552
00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:40.250
(Where is this clean place they can see everything in the water?)

553
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.381
Which part of the Garden did these three visit?

554
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:45.280
It's the Rainbow Reef, an area with massive corals,

555
00:24:45.421 --> 00:24:48.191
located between Taveuni and Vanua Levu Island.

556
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.591
The area got its name from the colorful corals...

557
00:24:51.661 --> 00:24:53.790
as they looked like a rainbow underwater.

558
00:24:54.191 --> 00:24:56.500
It's 1 of top 10 diving sites in the world.

559
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.661
This is a paradise for divers.

560
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.901
The area is embroidered in 390 kinds of different, beautiful corals.

561
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:05.740
The Rainbow Reef certainly shows a breathtaking view.

562
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.770
(Into the amazing view underwater)

563
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.780
The corals make a picturesque view of the sea in Fiji.

564
00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:11.881
Are you ready to join them?

565
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.810
Look at the color of the sea.

566
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.220
(They get ready to dive in.)

567
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.220
(Jin Woon takes off his shirt confidently.)

568
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.621
It's tighter than I thought.

569
00:25:21.191 --> 00:25:23.621
(However,)

570
00:25:23.621 --> 00:25:26.661
(it seems his excitement is taking over his body.)

571
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.760
All right.

572
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.500
(Jin Woon and Kang Nam seem excited,)

573
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.861
(but Bo Mi seems out of place.)

574
00:25:31.861 --> 00:25:35.101
(When the time to dive in nears, she looks even more troubled.)

575
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.270
Do you know how to swim?

576
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:39.341
I'm afraid of deep water.

577
00:25:40.141 --> 00:25:42.141
I fell into the water once when I was young,

578
00:25:42.411 --> 00:25:44.310
so my experience makes me scared of the water.

579
00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:49.250
I asked the staff earlier if I have to dive into deep water.

580
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.250
(If I must dive into deep water...)

581
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.421
If I must, I should practice before coming onto the show.

582
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.961
To feel more at ease in the water, Bo Mi got swimming lessons...

583
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.661
before leaving for the jungle.

584
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.931
Will she be able to handle it?

585
00:26:01.891 --> 00:26:04.830
Aren't you nervous? It's your first time snorkeling in deep water.

586
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.000
Yes, I am. I'm feeling slightly nervous now.

587
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.401
(At that time)

588
00:26:11.401 --> 00:26:13.871
(Don't be sad, no, no, no)

589
00:26:14.441 --> 00:26:17.641
(Of 1 mind and 1 goal, the guys...)

590
00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:20.010
(dance to encourage Bo Mi.)

591
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.181
- You were wearing a skirt then. - That was a long time ago.

592
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:26.421
Look at those tropical marine fish.

593
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.391
(The fish amazed Bo Mi.)

594
00:26:28.591 --> 00:26:29.790
My gosh. I like them so much.

595
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.320
(Come on in already.)

596
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.230
(The greeting of the fish excites them more.)

597
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.461
This is incredible.

598
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.230
You can do it! Tell me how they looked in person.

599
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.300
Okay.

600
00:26:38.461 --> 00:26:41.401
(They are ready to set out to the Rainbow Reef.)

601
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.000
(Jin Woon dives in first.)

602
00:26:43.941 --> 00:26:45.441
(Looking around)

603
00:26:46.211 --> 00:26:47.411
(How is it, Jin Woon?)

604
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:49.881
(Popping up)

605
00:26:50.441 --> 00:26:52.381
- This is fantastic. - Really?

606
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.080
It doesn't get too deep right away, right?

607
00:26:55.451 --> 00:26:56.681
Will I float back up?

608
00:26:56.851 --> 00:26:58.851
- The suit will keep you afloat. - Is that so?

609
00:26:59.421 --> 00:27:00.820
(She gets in after mustering courage.)

610
00:27:02.591 --> 00:27:04.421
(It looks like someone yanked her.)

611
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.861
My gosh, it's so cold! The water is freezing cold.

612
00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:12.361
Please stay by my side, okay?

613
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:14.671
(But she still manages to do what she's supposed to do.)

614
00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:18.270
Mom!

615
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:20.371
Hey, it's amazing here.

616
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:21.671
(He sparks...)

617
00:27:21.671 --> 00:27:23.980
(her curiosity.)

618
00:27:24.211 --> 00:27:27.780
(She makes a circle in the water.)

619
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.280
(Screaming in excitement)

620
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.851
(She gives a thumb up.)

621
00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:33.290
(She has entered a new world.)

622
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:36.461
(It seemed she was struggling in the water for a while.)

623
00:27:36.461 --> 00:27:38.820
(Just follow me.)

624
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:42.901
(Following Jin Woon in front,)

625
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:45.800
(she begins swimming.)

626
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.740
(She's slowly moving to the Rainbow Reef.)

627
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.270
(What are these?)

628
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:58.941
Thousands of fish passed by my side.

629
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.851
I felt like I had befriended fish.

630
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.951
It was beautiful.

631
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:08.651
I am usually afraid of water.

632
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.461
The beautiful scenery made me want to see more.

633
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.330
I continued to go farther.

634
00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:16.401
(Bo Mi is an inexperienced swimmer.)

635
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:19.361
Jin Woon stayed by my side and said,

636
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.841
"Let's continue to go at this pace." He tried to help me a lot.

637
00:28:22.841 --> 00:28:24.101
I was very thankful.

638
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.911
The way Bo Mi swims without holding back...

639
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:31.211
was unexpectedly pretty.

640
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.381
The scenery underwater was grand in a different way.

641
00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:36.820
I felt like I was watching a movie.

642
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:39.451
I loved it.

643
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:43.461
(Jin Woon dives.)

644
00:28:43.461 --> 00:28:46.760
(He looks graceful.)

645
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.461
(I am the prince of the sea.)

646
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.830
(While the two of them are absorbed in an expedition,)

647
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.141
(Kang Nam, who has the certificate, is at a scuba diving site.)

648
00:28:57.141 --> 00:28:59.740
(He will go deep into the water.)

649
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.470
(I heard it's more beautiful here.)

650
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:05.341
To be honest, I had dived at many different seas.

651
00:29:05.841 --> 00:29:09.750
I thought to myself, "I bet it will look the same."

652
00:29:10.121 --> 00:29:11.250
This sea was different.

653
00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.250
(Kang Nam reaches the coral reef.)

654
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.921
(The view is more splendid at the deep sea.)

655
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:19.220
(Follow me.)

656
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.631
(The school of fish welcomes him...)

657
00:29:23.631 --> 00:29:25.000
(and dances like petals.)

658
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.530
I could tell why people call it the Rainbow Reef.

659
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.641
Orange, pink, blue... I saw the colors so suddenly.

660
00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:32.000
There were beautiful fish.

661
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:34.740
I saw colors of the rainbow.

662
00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:37.911
(Puddingwife wrasse)

663
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:40.911
(Damselfish)

664
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:44.121
(Trumpetfish)

665
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:47.050
(What is this?)

666
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.121
(Christmas tree worm)

667
00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:50.990
The corals were like the rainbow. They were very vibrant in colors.

668
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:55.490
The sunlight made the view look like a work of art.

669
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.000
I was excited.

670
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.901
(He found a dazzling treasure underwater.)

671
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.201
(This sea is the best.)

672
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:08.270
Jin Woon and Bo Mi reach the deep sea.

673
00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.010
(They kick and swim close to the corals.)

674
00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:19.490
Even though I was exhausted, I couldn't stop diving.

675
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.550
I felt like I had become a mermaid.

676
00:30:24.421 --> 00:30:25.421
(It's a mermaid!)

677
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:26.990
(No, it's Bo Mi.)

678
00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:29.230
It was incredible.

679
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:33.970
I forgot about the struggles of the previous day.

680
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.740
(They feel like they are in a zero-gravity environment.)

681
00:30:40.111 --> 00:30:41.671
(Let's dive together this time.)

682
00:30:41.671 --> 00:30:43.240
(She follows Jin Woon...)

683
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.580
(and swims without hesitation.)

684
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.651
(Bo Mi overcomes her fear of water.)

685
00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:54.451
(Kang Nam is exploring the deep and dark part of the sea.)

686
00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:58.520
(However)

687
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.631
(Let's go that way.)

688
00:31:00.631 --> 00:31:01.990
(It's very big.)

689
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.161
I was surprised.

690
00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:06.000
When I felt something and looked around,

691
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.601
I saw something I hadn't imagined,

692
00:31:09.431 --> 00:31:10.671
big roses.

693
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.211
There were 500 and 1,000 of them. They were very big.

694
00:31:15.411 --> 00:31:16.740
They were very big in scale.

695
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.740
(It's a view he has never seen before.)

696
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.780
(What are these mysterious roses?)

697
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.280
I got goosebumps the moment I saw them.

698
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.351
What are these?

699
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:24.520
(What are these?)

700
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.391
- What are these? - Corals.

701
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.391
I asked the cameraman,

702
00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:31.461
but he said it was his first time seeing them.

703
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:34.431
I shouted in the water.

704
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.060
Both of us were surprised.

705
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.461
You wouldn't see them anywhere else.

706
00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:40.901
(They hadn't expected to see a field of flowers.)

707
00:31:43.941 --> 00:31:46.740
(He doesn't know how to show his excitement.)

708
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.381
Cartoon artists draw things out of their imagination.

709
00:31:52.441 --> 00:31:53.451
That's what it felt like.

710
00:31:53.451 --> 00:31:54.750
(The fantastic size and shape belong in cartoons.)

711
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.280
There were big corals.

712
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.361
(I am the main character of this cartoon.)

713
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.830
(Is he Oscar in a rose garden?)

714
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:16.901
(He applauds the greatness of the nature.)

715
00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:18.240
I was fascinated.

716
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.740
I think there is a different world under the sea.

717
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.111
("The great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.")

718
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.951
(He returns feeling as though he is drunk.)

719
00:32:29.951 --> 00:32:31.151
That was incredible.

720
00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:34.421
Even the cameraman was surprised.

721
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:36.320
He went into the sea 3,000 times.

722
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:39.790
- I have never seen such big ones. - Right?

723
00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.560
It was beautiful.

724
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.931
(Did the mermaid forget how to walk?)

725
00:32:45.961 --> 00:32:47.470
It was incredible.

726
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.401
It was incredible.

727
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.601
They met the new world under the sea during their tiring survival.

728
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.770
It's a gift from the above.

729
00:32:56.941 --> 00:33:00.280
Meanwhile, Moon Sik revisited the water slide...

730
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:02.681
with Cho Rong and Yun Hyeong.

731
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.951
We need to go down the slide since we are here.

732
00:33:05.951 --> 00:33:07.451
I enjoy the thrill.

733
00:33:08.621 --> 00:33:09.760
Cho Rong, are you okay?

734
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.720
(She struggled yesterday because of her eyes.)

735
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.161
Yes, my eyes are twinkling now.

736
00:33:14.891 --> 00:33:16.161
Look at her eyes. They are twinkling.

737
00:33:17.631 --> 00:33:19.260
Your eyes are fine now, right?

738
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.841
They are totally fine. They really are.

739
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.470
They are twinkling.

740
00:33:27.211 --> 00:33:29.911
Hearing the water makes me feel refreshed.

741
00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:30.980
How will we go down it?

742
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.641
- How scary! - Will you be able to go down?

743
00:33:32.641 --> 00:33:33.651
(The sight leaves them a bit flustered.)

744
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:34.851
Where does it end?

745
00:33:34.851 --> 00:33:36.451
There is less water today.

746
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.990
Compared to yesterday, the water is clearer.

747
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.990
- There was a lot yesterday. - That must have been scary.

748
00:33:44.191 --> 00:33:46.290
This is a bit scary.

749
00:33:46.361 --> 00:33:48.131
Where does the water slide begin and end?

750
00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:50.500
Do you see the white part of the water?

751
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.701
That's where it starts.

752
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:57.540
They can slide down 30m without stopping.

753
00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.411
This is the unearthly playground, the natural water slide.

754
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.780
There is just the right amount of water for enjoyment.

755
00:34:06.451 --> 00:34:09.410
Shall we fall into it?

756
00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.120
Shall we go?

757
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:15.091
- You can go first. - It's scary.

758
00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:17.221
- Let's go. - Let's go.

759
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.330
- I bet the water is cold. - I know.

760
00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:21.790
The water is cold.

761
00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:23.330
I need to warm up.

762
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.000
(He begins to warm up his body.)

763
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:28.770
Be careful.

764
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.841
(A warm up is a must before entering cold water.)

765
00:34:31.841 --> 00:34:33.640
It's better than yesterday.

766
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.841
(The less amount of water makes the experience better.)

767
00:34:34.841 --> 00:34:40.580
(He enters right away.)

768
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.611
It's okay.

769
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.781
Let's go.

770
00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.191
- Let's go. - Let's go.

771
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.991
(He goes without holding back.)

772
00:34:48.991 --> 00:34:50.120
Let's go.

773
00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:53.660
(It's a refreshing sight.)

774
00:34:54.031 --> 00:34:55.031
My goodness.

775
00:34:55.031 --> 00:34:57.100
(Moon Sik slides down expertly.)

776
00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:00.230
(The natural water slide offers a smooth path.)

777
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.230
My goodness.

778
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:03.640
(Shouting)

779
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.410
(The speed is perfect.)

780
00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:12.850
(He slides down fast.)

781
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.921
(Shouting)

782
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.120
(He passes through the corner...)

783
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.390
(and arrives at the bottom.)

784
00:35:27.131 --> 00:35:28.131
(Wow)

785
00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:29.131
Are you okay?

786
00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:31.500
(I am okay.)

787
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.330
You are cool.

788
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.370
(Bravo, Moon Sik.)

789
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.500
(The water seems to be too cold.)

790
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:39.870
The water is cold.

791
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.870
(I will give it a go too.)

792
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.841
Come on.

793
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:43.841
(It's the younger members' turn.)

794
00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.881
Let's go.

795
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:47.151
I am scared.

796
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.450
My goodness, I am scared.

797
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.290
- What am I going to do? - The current is too strong.

798
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.290
Isn't the current too strong?

799
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.191
What is this?

800
00:35:57.191 --> 00:35:58.890
(Come on in.)

801
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.230
- Should I go first? - Go first.

802
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.660
- I will follow right away. - Okay.

803
00:36:03.131 --> 00:36:05.531
- Watch me go. - Then I will follow.

804
00:36:05.531 --> 00:36:06.531
Okay.

805
00:36:07.301 --> 00:36:08.401
(Yun Hyeong enters the water carefully.)

806
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:10.301
- Be careful. - It's not as cold as I thought.

807
00:36:10.341 --> 00:36:11.841
- Really? - It's not as cold as I thought.

808
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.810
Be careful.

809
00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.171
Here I go.

810
00:36:15.471 --> 00:36:16.511
Good luck.

811
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.011
(At first, he soaks his body lightly.)

812
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:23.750
(The onlooker is excited.)

813
00:36:25.781 --> 00:36:28.890
(The slope is gentle in the beginning.)

814
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.721
(Then the ride picks up the speed.)

815
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.230
(Speeding up)

816
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.901
(Fiji water park opens.)

817
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:43.901
(Yun Hyeong slides down at an incredible speed.)

818
00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:49.441
(It's a collaboration between cold water and exhilarating speed.)

819
00:36:50.711 --> 00:36:54.211
(Half screaming and half exclaiming)

820
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.151
That's it. That's it.

821
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:04.120
(He swallowed a bucket of water at the end.)

822
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.520
(It was still fun.)

823
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.160
That was fun.

824
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.930
(I gave it my all.)

825
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.600
Slide down slowly.

826
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.730
I am scared.

827
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.270
(Meanwhile, Cho Rong...)

828
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.401
(is scared.)

829
00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:18.870
My goodness. Someone save me.

830
00:37:20.441 --> 00:37:22.511
(Will I be able to slide down?)

831
00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:25.040
Good luck. You can do it.

832
00:37:25.511 --> 00:37:26.611
My goodness.

833
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.020
Gosh, it's cold.

834
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.020
(The water is cold and the current is strong.)

835
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.321
The current is strong.

836
00:37:35.091 --> 00:37:38.321
(The beginning is slow.)

837
00:37:38.321 --> 00:37:40.631
This is fun.

838
00:37:40.631 --> 00:37:42.290
(She changes her mind in 5 seconds.)

839
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Here I go.

840
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.730
(Brave)

841
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.330
Here I go.

842
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.171
(Go down the water slide.)

843
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.140
(Screaming)

844
00:37:55.841 --> 00:37:57.511
(Was she really scared at first?)

845
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.680
(It's impossible to tell if she is laughing or screaming.)

846
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.180
My butt hurts.

847
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.191
It was fun.

848
00:38:06.191 --> 00:38:07.290
(Even though it hurts, it was fun.)

849
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:11.321
(She enters the acceleration area.)

850
00:38:11.321 --> 00:38:15.261
(Is this a commercial for a water park?)

851
00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:20.171
(Contact Apink if you want them as the models for a water park.)

852
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.270
(She gets submerged in water in the end.)

853
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.741
(Were you thirsty, Cho Rong?)

854
00:38:32.741 --> 00:38:36.850
(Despite drinking water, she is excited.)

855
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.321
That was fun.

856
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:41.290
(Laughing)

857
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:44.861
(Moon Sik takes care of the younger members.)

858
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:46.020
I drank a lot of water.

859
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.031
- Did you? - Yes.

860
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.861
I drank a lot of water.

861
00:38:50.031 --> 00:38:51.100
Cho Rong,

862
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.930
you fell on your butt.

863
00:38:53.571 --> 00:38:54.870
- Are you okay? - Yes.

864
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.301
(The thrill made them forget about the unpleasantness.)

865
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600
That was incredible.

866
00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.270
It was fun.

867
00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.941
You did a good job.

868
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:03.741
Shall we dive?

869
00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.640
- My goodness. - This is incredible.

870
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:07.950
This is incredible.

871
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:09.211
Is this for real?

872
00:39:09.211 --> 00:39:10.221
(When they look from above,)

873
00:39:10.221 --> 00:39:11.480
(the height is dizzying.)

874
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.520
(The height is scary.)

875
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.721
The water is deep.

876
00:39:14.721 --> 00:39:16.890
(Moon Sik readies himself while Yun Hyeong hesitates.)

877
00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.020
All right.

878
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.691
I will jump in first.

879
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.290
Be careful.

880
00:39:22.531 --> 00:39:24.901
The Law of Jungle, let's go!

881
00:39:24.901 --> 00:39:26.100
Let's go!

882
00:39:26.631 --> 00:39:29.370
(Jump)

883
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.971
(He dives in without hesitation.)

884
00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:35.640
- That was incredible. - He is cool.

885
00:39:36.211 --> 00:39:38.540
All right. Here I go.

886
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.551
(Yun Hyeong gets ready to dive.)

887
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:41.881
- The Law of Jungle. - The Garden of the Spirits.

888
00:39:41.881 --> 00:39:43.151
- Let's go. - Let's go.

889
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.821
Let's go.

890
00:39:47.321 --> 00:39:51.890
(He jumps in without hesitation.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

891
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:52.991
(Yun Hyeong is great.)

892
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.290
(Good luck.)

893
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.200
I want to do it again. Let me go again.

894
00:39:58.461 --> 00:40:00.131
- That was fun. - He got hooked.

895
00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:02.971
The Garden of the Spirits, let's go.

896
00:40:02.971 --> 00:40:05.971
(Yun Hyeong is addicted.)

897
00:40:05.971 --> 00:40:07.310
Let me go again.

898
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:10.680
(No one can resist the experience after the first try.)

899
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.611
This is fun.

900
00:40:13.611 --> 00:40:17.620
It was the same as the water park. I had so much fun.

901
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.421
It was my first time diving, but I had so much fun.

902
00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.191
I jumped about three times.

903
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:23.721
(He is satisfied.)

904
00:40:24.591 --> 00:40:27.691
I felt like I had returned to being a kid.

905
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.700
It was fascinating.

906
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.171
The current was faster than I had imagined.

907
00:40:33.171 --> 00:40:34.700
It was really like a slide.

908
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.640
I enjoyed playing in the playground...

909
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.870
the nature has created.

910
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:41.011
It was amazing.

911
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:44.341
I drank a lot of water.

912
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:48.281
With the refreshing water slide,

913
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:50.721
they washed away the exhaustion that has built up.

914
00:40:51.321 --> 00:40:54.221
Anyway, did the fishing team catch something?

915
00:40:54.421 --> 00:40:56.660
(Tae Gon and Dam are still waiting for fish to bite.)

916
00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.361
Don't birds such as gulls fly over the fish?

917
00:41:00.361 --> 00:41:01.691
That's how it usually is.

918
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:04.560
- It's a jackpot if there are birds. - That means there are fish.

919
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.631
It's a jackpot if there are birds.

920
00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:06.700
(Where are the birds?)

921
00:41:08.631 --> 00:41:10.241
- I see a flock of birds. - Where?

922
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:11.841
I see a flock of birds. There are a lot.

923
00:41:11.841 --> 00:41:12.841
(Do you see the birds?)

924
00:41:13.011 --> 00:41:14.071
Birds.

925
00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:15.171
There are a lot of bids.

926
00:41:15.171 --> 00:41:16.580
(They find a flock of birds.)

927
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.611
This is incredible.

928
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.480
There are a lot of birds.

929
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.680
(They are happy to see a flock of birds.)

930
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.781
- There are birds. - Tuna.

931
00:41:21.781 --> 00:41:23.520
- Tuna? - Tuna.

932
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.221
- Tuna. - Tuna.

933
00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:27.120
- Tuna. - Let's go.

934
00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.861
- There are birds. - Okay.

935
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.890
This is great.

936
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.890
I have never seen so many birds.

937
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:36.131
They must be hunting.

938
00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:39.700
That means there are anchovies underwater.

939
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.200
That means...

940
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.901
there are a lot of fish underwater.

941
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:47.511
- I have never seen so many birds. - Really?

942
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:50.580
I have seen 10 or 20 birds. Over there, it looks like...

943
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.781
there are 200 birds.

944
00:41:51.781 --> 00:41:52.850
(Hundreds of birds is solid evidence of fish.)

945
00:41:53.051 --> 00:41:55.350
- There are fish here. - That's right.

946
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.151
The birds are circling the place.

947
00:41:58.651 --> 00:41:59.651
It's raining.

948
00:41:59.651 --> 00:42:00.850
(They are near swordfish or tuna.)

949
00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:01.921
I don't think it will rain there.

950
00:42:03.191 --> 00:42:04.361
(Did you hear that?)

951
00:42:04.361 --> 00:42:05.421
(Whipping)

952
00:42:06.961 --> 00:42:08.761
(The fishing rod bends.)

953
00:42:09.361 --> 00:42:10.531
(What is going on?)

954
00:42:10.731 --> 00:42:12.331
- Get up. Come on. - What is going on?

955
00:42:13.451 --> 00:42:15.750
- There are fish here. - That's right.

956
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.551
The birds are circling the place.

957
00:42:19.051 --> 00:42:20.051
It's raining.

958
00:42:20.051 --> 00:42:21.250
(They are near swordfish or tuna.)

959
00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.321
I don't think it will rain there.

960
00:42:23.591 --> 00:42:24.761
(Did you hear that?)

961
00:42:24.761 --> 00:42:25.821
(Whipping)

962
00:42:27.361 --> 00:42:29.161
(The fishing rod bends.)

963
00:42:29.761 --> 00:42:30.931
(What is going on?)

964
00:42:30.931 --> 00:42:32.531
- Get up. Come on. - What is going on?

965
00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:33.871
My goodness.

966
00:42:34.679 --> 00:42:35.719
Did you hear it?

967
00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.519
What was that?

968
00:42:37.519 --> 00:42:39.248
- He heard it too. - It bent a little bit.

969
00:42:39.248 --> 00:42:40.289
It bent a little bit.

970
00:42:41.619 --> 00:42:43.619
It's raining.

971
00:42:43.619 --> 00:42:44.659
I was so surprised.

972
00:42:44.659 --> 00:42:47.128
- That means fish bit and let go. - Really?

973
00:42:47.128 --> 00:42:49.159
There are fish.

974
00:42:49.259 --> 00:42:50.759
It touched the bait.

975
00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:53.829
The fish bit and let go.

976
00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:57.938
- You heard it, right? - That woke me up.

977
00:42:57.938 --> 00:42:59.438
This is what happens.

978
00:42:59.438 --> 00:43:01.369
It comes when you let go...

979
00:43:01.608 --> 00:43:02.639
and give up.

980
00:43:02.639 --> 00:43:03.708
(The fish plays hard to get.)

981
00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:06.548
It was incredible to hear the sound.

982
00:43:06.548 --> 00:43:09.219
The birds need to be here for longer.

983
00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:11.719
Why did the birds disperse?

984
00:43:12.889 --> 00:43:14.418
(What?)

985
00:43:14.418 --> 00:43:16.559
- The fish must have dispersed. - Where did they go?

986
00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:18.588
- I bet they didn't like the boat. - I know. They dispersed.

987
00:43:18.588 --> 00:43:20.128
(The birds suddenly disappear after the first bite.)

988
00:43:20.128 --> 00:43:22.898
We searched the area with the hovering birds.

989
00:43:22.898 --> 00:43:23.929
(Still, fish don't bite.)

990
00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:25.159
That's when I became worried.

991
00:43:26.028 --> 00:43:29.139
"It shouldn't be like this. Please, please."

992
00:43:30.699 --> 00:43:33.039
"Please bite."

993
00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:34.039
(Tae Gon begs the fish.)

994
00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:35.039
It's upsetting.

995
00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:37.438
(He is reminded...)

996
00:43:38.378 --> 00:43:40.679
(of his painful memories.)

997
00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:44.179
(He was confident in Siberia.)

998
00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:46.318
(However, he failed to catch fish.)

999
00:43:46.318 --> 00:43:48.858
(Tae Gon never caught fish on The Law of Jungle.)

1000
00:43:48.858 --> 00:43:52.159
(He has always been confident.)

1001
00:43:52.159 --> 00:43:57.128
(In Brunei, he broke his fishing rod.)

1002
00:43:57.128 --> 00:43:58.728
If I fail again,

1003
00:43:59.628 --> 00:44:00.668
I will live quietly.

1004
00:44:01.298 --> 00:44:02.398
I won't talk about fishing.

1005
00:44:02.739 --> 00:44:06.239
How will I fish when I go back to Korea?

1006
00:44:06.239 --> 00:44:08.309
It's quite easy to fail to catch fish.

1007
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:09.309
(He begins to give excuses.)

1008
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:11.679
You can fail 10 out of 10 times.

1009
00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:13.148
(Rambling)

1010
00:44:13.778 --> 00:44:15.179
It's incredibly hard to succeed...

1011
00:44:15.179 --> 00:44:18.789
during the five-hour shoot.

1012
00:44:20.719 --> 00:44:23.418
(6 hours pass.)

1013
00:44:23.418 --> 00:44:25.929
(Cameras turn off one by one.)

1014
00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:29.398
(Will they give up?)

1015
00:44:30.259 --> 00:44:31.929
Two fish might come at once.

1016
00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:34.798
- Fish will come. - I have a good feeling about this.

1017
00:44:34.798 --> 00:44:35.969
(They haven't given up hope.)

1018
00:44:35.969 --> 00:44:37.798
- Tunas aren't the only fish. - You are right.

1019
00:44:37.798 --> 00:44:39.739
- There are barracudas. - Barracudas. Groupers.

1020
00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:41.869
- Dorados. - Dorados.

1021
00:44:42.278 --> 00:44:45.608
I don't think there are a lot of fish.

1022
00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:48.208
Only the lucky ones catch fish.

1023
00:44:48.478 --> 00:44:50.579
- Come on. - Get out of the way.

1024
00:44:50.579 --> 00:44:52.619
- Get out of the way. - It's fish.

1025
00:44:52.619 --> 00:44:53.918
- It's fish. - Okay.

1026
00:44:53.918 --> 00:44:54.949
It's here.

1027
00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:57.088
- Get out of the way. - Give it to me.

1028
00:44:57.088 --> 00:44:58.259
(It's this fishing rod.)

1029
00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:01.329
(It bends out of sight.)

1030
00:45:02.528 --> 00:45:05.298
- Get out of the way. - It's here. It's here.

1031
00:45:05.298 --> 00:45:08.599
- Which one is it? - Get out of the way.

1032
00:45:09.438 --> 00:45:11.269
Did it fall off?

1033
00:45:11.898 --> 00:45:12.969
Did it fall off?

1034
00:45:13.108 --> 00:45:14.168
It fell off.

1035
00:45:14.509 --> 00:45:15.739
(For goodness' sake.)

1036
00:45:16.009 --> 00:45:17.338
Fish fall off easily.

1037
00:45:17.938 --> 00:45:19.409
We now know that there are fish.

1038
00:45:20.148 --> 00:45:21.248
(Howling)

1039
00:45:22.418 --> 00:45:23.418
How unfortunate!

1040
00:45:23.418 --> 00:45:24.418
(Hope is on our side.)

1041
00:45:24.418 --> 00:45:25.418
All right.

1042
00:45:25.418 --> 00:45:26.989
(Fish will come again.)

1043
00:45:26.989 --> 00:45:29.918
- It will come again. - I skinned my knee.

1044
00:45:29.918 --> 00:45:31.958
- Did you hear the sound? - Yes, I did.

1045
00:45:31.958 --> 00:45:35.389
The sound lasted longer this time.

1046
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:37.498
The sound lasted longer this time.

1047
00:45:37.498 --> 00:45:39.798
- What was that? I saw fish jump. - Where?

1048
00:45:40.168 --> 00:45:41.969
I saw fish jump.

1049
00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:43.168
- Really? - Yes.

1050
00:45:43.168 --> 00:45:44.298
There it is.

1051
00:45:44.298 --> 00:45:46.409
When the fish bites again, it will be the third time.

1052
00:45:46.608 --> 00:45:48.239
We will catch fish on our third try.

1053
00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:49.309
Really?

1054
00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:52.378
- All right. - This is the place.

1055
00:45:52.378 --> 00:45:53.708
- My goodness. - Be careful.

1056
00:45:53.708 --> 00:45:54.909
(Moon Sik, Cho Rong, and Yun Hyeong are exploring.)

1057
00:45:54.909 --> 00:45:56.579
The sea is cool.

1058
00:45:57.048 --> 00:45:58.478
It's Jeju Island!

1059
00:45:58.478 --> 00:46:00.719
It really looks like Jeju Island.

1060
00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:01.889
The rocks look like those of Jeju Island.

1061
00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:04.789
- We are at Jeju Island. - This is blue moon.

1062
00:46:04.789 --> 00:46:06.289
- Blue moon? - Blue hole.

1063
00:46:06.559 --> 00:46:07.559
Where is it?

1064
00:46:08.389 --> 00:46:09.559
(Amazed)

1065
00:46:10.998 --> 00:46:12.429
(Is there something?)

1066
00:46:12.628 --> 00:46:14.269
That must be the blue hole.

1067
00:46:14.269 --> 00:46:16.298
- That's incredible. - That must be it.

1068
00:46:17.969 --> 00:46:19.838
(A column of water shoots up from the beach.)

1069
00:46:19.838 --> 00:46:22.478
A tall column of water shoots up from the beach.

1070
00:46:22.809 --> 00:46:25.079
This is a blow hole.

1071
00:46:26.748 --> 00:46:29.079
When the wave enters the hole...

1072
00:46:29.079 --> 00:46:30.949
that was created due to volcanic activities,

1073
00:46:30.949 --> 00:46:33.148
the seawater that was inside shoots up...

1074
00:46:33.148 --> 00:46:34.748
due to the water pressure.

1075
00:46:35.818 --> 00:46:38.458
A big and powerful column of water...

1076
00:46:38.458 --> 00:46:39.728
makes a wonderful sight.

1077
00:46:39.728 --> 00:46:41.889
(It looks like computer graphics in the movie.)

1078
00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:45.329
(It will be big up-close.)

1079
00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:46.398
It's dizzying.

1080
00:46:48.068 --> 00:46:49.168
Here it comes.

1081
00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:52.869
(Cho Rong raises her arms.)

1082
00:46:53.139 --> 00:46:54.708
(This is like...)

1083
00:46:54.708 --> 00:46:57.579
("Frozen".)

1084
00:46:59.009 --> 00:47:00.378
(There!)

1085
00:47:01.378 --> 00:47:03.378
(Cho Rong, the magician princess)

1086
00:47:06.248 --> 00:47:09.059
(They exclaim when Cho Rong raises her arms.)

1087
00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:10.358
(This is fun.)

1088
00:47:11.318 --> 00:47:12.759
How can it splash like that?

1089
00:47:12.759 --> 00:47:14.329
(Yun Hyeong is having a touching moment.)

1090
00:47:14.389 --> 00:47:15.858
- What's that? - It's like a humidifier.

1091
00:47:16.259 --> 00:47:18.199
- Like a mist. - Mist?

1092
00:47:19.429 --> 00:47:20.898
- Really? - Like a bidet.

1093
00:47:21.099 --> 00:47:23.498
- Bidet? - Should we go sit there?

1094
00:47:23.938 --> 00:47:25.168
You thought of a bidet looking at that?

1095
00:47:25.168 --> 00:47:26.269
- Like this. - I see.

1096
00:47:27.039 --> 00:47:28.539
(I can talk with my body.)

1097
00:47:30.708 --> 00:47:32.708
(The largest bidet in the world)

1098
00:47:34.449 --> 00:47:35.778
Shall we go as close to it as possible?

1099
00:47:35.778 --> 00:47:36.978
(They want to check out the bidet up close.)

1100
00:47:37.748 --> 00:47:39.748
- I thought it was a blue hole. - Me too.

1101
00:47:39.748 --> 00:47:42.188
- I thought so too. - But it was a blowhole.

1102
00:47:42.188 --> 00:47:43.318
Yes, that's what I thought.

1103
00:47:43.318 --> 00:47:45.688
- Goodness! - Gosh.

1104
00:47:46.958 --> 00:47:49.199
(It's more mesmerizing up close.)

1105
00:47:49.929 --> 00:47:51.298
Don't you want to know what's it's like inside?

1106
00:47:51.298 --> 00:47:52.929
- Yes. - I want to see the hole.

1107
00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:55.168
- I'll go check it out. - It's dangerous.

1108
00:47:55.168 --> 00:47:57.068
- I'll go this way. - What if waves roll in?

1109
00:47:57.068 --> 00:47:58.099
(Moon Sik takes the lead.)

1110
00:47:58.099 --> 00:47:59.568
(He moves closer carefully.)

1111
00:47:59.568 --> 00:48:01.239
- Please be careful. - Be careful.

1112
00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:02.878
There's a hole.

1113
00:48:03.509 --> 00:48:04.509
There it comes.

1114
00:48:04.509 --> 00:48:06.248
(It shoots up right then.)

1115
00:48:07.809 --> 00:48:10.378
(Going to the source of the pillar of water)

1116
00:48:10.378 --> 00:48:13.849
(Splash)

1117
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:16.458
(Extremely powerful)

1118
00:48:16.458 --> 00:48:20.028
(Cannot see anything at all)

1119
00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:24.159
(As you look at the blowhole up close...)

1120
00:48:24.159 --> 00:48:26.469
(an extremely powerful pillar of water shoots up.)

1121
00:48:27.528 --> 00:48:28.998
(Scared)

1122
00:48:30.039 --> 00:48:32.838
(Just when he lets his guard down,)

1123
00:48:32.838 --> 00:48:35.338
(he gets attacked by the powerful waves.)

1124
00:48:35.338 --> 00:48:37.179
(A sudden salt water shower)

1125
00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:38.338
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1126
00:48:40.679 --> 00:48:41.679
Help me!

1127
00:48:41.978 --> 00:48:44.248
- Please don't hurt me. - Come up here.

1128
00:48:44.978 --> 00:48:47.548
(Goodness)

1129
00:48:47.548 --> 00:48:49.958
- It's getting stronger. - Why is it getting stronger?

1130
00:48:49.958 --> 00:48:51.458
- It's telling us to stay back. - It doesn't want us there.

1131
00:48:51.458 --> 00:48:53.429
- It doesn't want us. - It's saying "Don't come near."

1132
00:48:54.159 --> 00:48:56.099
- It's like a whale blowing water. - Yes.

1133
00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.858
(They keep a safe distance from the blowhole.)

1134
00:49:01.068 --> 00:49:03.298
- It's like a dragon is breathing. - Yes.

1135
00:49:04.869 --> 00:49:05.938
It's pretty.

1136
00:49:05.938 --> 00:49:07.009
- It is. - Really.

1137
00:49:07.009 --> 00:49:09.139
(They enjoy their short break in front of a blowhole.)

1138
00:49:09.139 --> 00:49:10.179
(Screaming)

1139
00:49:11.838 --> 00:49:13.378
(But...)

1140
00:49:13.378 --> 00:49:17.349
(they're just getting showered with sea water.)

1141
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:18.619
(They're still excited.)

1142
00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:20.789
- Amazing. - Awesome.

1143
00:49:21.548 --> 00:49:24.519
(Yun Hyeong rates it 10 out of 10.)

1144
00:49:25.259 --> 00:49:26.458
(They're just happy.)

1145
00:49:26.458 --> 00:49:28.028
I'm all wet.

1146
00:49:29.159 --> 00:49:31.059
- This is cool. - I'm all wet.

1147
00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:33.469
- Here's another one. - Here it comes.

1148
00:49:33.469 --> 00:49:35.099
(The waves are playing with them.)

1149
00:49:35.998 --> 00:49:37.269
(They're soaked.)

1150
00:49:37.269 --> 00:49:38.369
This is awesome.

1151
00:49:39.608 --> 00:49:42.809
(When they're this soaked, they should quit playing.)

1152
00:49:42.809 --> 00:49:44.139
Gosh, we are completely soaked.

1153
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:45.378
Let's leave.

1154
00:49:45.378 --> 00:49:46.478
(All right, we're leaving.)

1155
00:49:46.478 --> 00:49:47.679
I think they don't want us here.

1156
00:49:47.679 --> 00:49:50.648
Getting wet isn't a problem anymore.

1157
00:49:51.179 --> 00:49:53.648
They finished exploring the blowholes.

1158
00:49:53.648 --> 00:49:55.719
(Blowhole exploration complete)

1159
00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.219
Let's go.

1160
00:49:57.219 --> 00:49:59.259
- This is freshwater. - Yes.

1161
00:49:59.259 --> 00:50:00.989
Shouldn't there be fish?

1162
00:50:00.989 --> 00:50:03.059
- Trout or eel. - We haven't caught trout.

1163
00:50:04.059 --> 00:50:06.528
Guys, do you hear this?

1164
00:50:07.168 --> 00:50:09.469
- It's a waterfall. - Do you hear the water?

1165
00:50:09.469 --> 00:50:10.798
Is it really close?

1166
00:50:11.668 --> 00:50:13.739
- It sounds amazing. - I love this.

1167
00:50:14.269 --> 00:50:15.608
- The sound of rough nature. - There it is.

1168
00:50:15.608 --> 00:50:17.139
- I see it. - What do you see?

1169
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:18.338
I see it.

1170
00:50:18.338 --> 00:50:19.878
(Their hopes for catching fish is growing.)

1171
00:50:19.878 --> 00:50:21.179
(Let's see.)

1172
00:50:23.548 --> 00:50:26.019
(They've only heard of a triple waterfall.)

1173
00:50:26.019 --> 00:50:27.389
(What does it actually look like?)

1174
00:50:27.389 --> 00:50:28.889
There it is.

1175
00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:32.559
(Inside the tranquil jungle is...)

1176
00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:36.128
(a triple water with great energy.)

1177
00:50:41.068 --> 00:50:42.969
There was a triple waterfall...

1178
00:50:42.969 --> 00:50:45.338
in a densely wooded forest. It was like CG.

1179
00:50:46.068 --> 00:50:48.708
(A beautiful and harmonious scenery by nature)

1180
00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:51.438
I've seen single or double waterfalls before, but not triple.

1181
00:50:51.438 --> 00:50:52.548
1, 2, 3.

1182
00:50:52.748 --> 00:50:53.878
Up close, it was a bit scary.

1183
00:50:53.878 --> 00:50:54.878
(The energy is overwhelming.)

1184
00:50:55.179 --> 00:50:57.748
I could only see the first and second tiers.

1185
00:50:57.748 --> 00:51:00.489
But there was a huge third tier in the back.

1186
00:51:01.489 --> 00:51:03.059
It was magnificent.

1187
00:51:04.318 --> 00:51:06.688
But there is a secret to the triple waterfall...

1188
00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:08.358
they didn't know.

1189
00:51:08.728 --> 00:51:10.929
If you go in farther,

1190
00:51:11.099 --> 00:51:15.269
you can see that it's actually a septuple waterfall.

1191
00:51:15.269 --> 00:51:16.269
(There are seven tiers in total!)

1192
00:51:20.269 --> 00:51:21.708
It's a really amazing sight.

1193
00:51:21.708 --> 00:51:22.809
(The great nature has endless secrets.)

1194
00:51:26.009 --> 00:51:27.778
That's a great spot for fishing.

1195
00:51:28.708 --> 00:51:31.248
You should go there and stand under the waterfall.

1196
00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:34.148
The team who came before us did.

1197
00:51:34.648 --> 00:51:36.619
(It's because they were beasts.)

1198
00:51:36.619 --> 00:51:37.719
It's too scary.

1199
00:51:38.119 --> 00:51:40.528
I should take my shirt off. Should I keep it on?

1200
00:51:40.528 --> 00:51:41.528
(Let's start hunting!)

1201
00:51:41.989 --> 00:51:43.099
You must be cold.

1202
00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.099
(Jin Woon has been taking his shirt off a lot today.)

1203
00:51:44.298 --> 00:51:46.068
It's much colder when your clothes are wet.

1204
00:51:46.068 --> 00:51:47.668
- Really? - Yes.

1205
00:51:47.969 --> 00:51:49.039
Is that right?

1206
00:51:49.369 --> 00:51:51.438
(I'm an innocent idol Apink,)

1207
00:51:51.438 --> 00:51:55.208
(but for hunting I will...)

1208
00:51:55.208 --> 00:51:56.679
(Gosh)

1209
00:51:57.079 --> 00:51:58.708
- Are you serious? - No.

1210
00:51:59.478 --> 00:52:01.548
(Bo Mi is so naughty.)

1211
00:52:03.978 --> 00:52:05.148
It's cold!

1212
00:52:05.148 --> 00:52:06.588
(It's cold, but we'll go in to hunt.)

1213
00:52:06.588 --> 00:52:08.318
(Getting ready to dive in)

1214
00:52:11.559 --> 00:52:14.688
(Everyone is sure that this is the fishing spot.)

1215
00:52:16.728 --> 00:52:19.269
(I'm the yellow haired beast.)

1216
00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:21.699
(Beast Kang Nam is coming.)

1217
00:52:21.699 --> 00:52:23.798
(He ignores the cold,)

1218
00:52:23.798 --> 00:52:26.309
(and prepares to greet the prey.)

1219
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.978
(Jin Woon who is full of energy...)

1220
00:52:28.978 --> 00:52:30.179
(dives in as well.)

1221
00:52:31.079 --> 00:52:32.978
(They hunt together as a team.)

1222
00:52:35.048 --> 00:52:37.248
(They dived in completely. The real fishing starts now.)

1223
00:52:39.519 --> 00:52:41.389
(It won't be like the shrimp hunting.)

1224
00:52:43.458 --> 00:52:45.259
(Bo Mi doesn't idle about.)

1225
00:52:45.259 --> 00:52:46.989
(She explores eagerly.)

1226
00:52:49.528 --> 00:52:51.028
(Kang Nam and Jin Woon take the lead.)

1227
00:52:51.028 --> 00:52:52.128
(Bo Mi follows them behind.)

1228
00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.568
(Bo Mi searches for fish.)

1229
00:52:55.998 --> 00:52:57.739
(Right then,)

1230
00:52:58.039 --> 00:53:01.269
(She spots a school of fish.)

1231
00:53:03.278 --> 00:53:04.778
There are fish!

1232
00:53:05.338 --> 00:53:06.778
- Really? - Yes.

1233
00:53:06.778 --> 00:53:07.809
(They could be trouts or eels.)

1234
00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.849
(Kang Nam is on the left and Jin Woon is on the right.)

1235
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:12.548
(Bo Mi is the commander-in-chief.)

1236
00:53:13.688 --> 00:53:16.019
(Mad Max: Fury Waterfall)

1237
00:53:17.759 --> 00:53:19.989
(Concentrate. They're here.)

1238
00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:23.329
(But...)

1239
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:25.259
(there is nothing.)

1240
00:53:26.028 --> 00:53:28.369
(Fish, where are you hiding?)

1241
00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:30.668
(Bo Mi is embarrassed.)

1242
00:53:32.668 --> 00:53:33.739
I'm cold.

1243
00:53:34.068 --> 00:53:37.608
(Did I see fish ghosts?)

1244
00:53:37.608 --> 00:53:38.909
(I don't see anything.)

1245
00:53:39.179 --> 00:53:40.278
Should we go over there?

1246
00:53:41.048 --> 00:53:42.519
I think it's better to be in the water.

1247
00:53:42.949 --> 00:53:45.179
No, it's not.

1248
00:53:45.849 --> 00:53:47.119
I don't see any fish.

1249
00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:48.619
(But it's too early to give up.)

1250
00:53:48.719 --> 00:53:50.159
(They need to move down the stream...)

1251
00:53:50.159 --> 00:53:52.688
(where the current is weaker unlike the upper stream.)

1252
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:54.159
(Turning over a new leaf)

1253
00:53:56.498 --> 00:53:57.898
(They seek with avidity.)

1254
00:53:59.568 --> 00:54:01.369
(Right then,)

1255
00:54:01.369 --> 00:54:03.239
(a silver fish swims by.)

1256
00:54:05.568 --> 00:54:06.708
There it is!

1257
00:54:07.369 --> 00:54:08.708
There's fish.

1258
00:54:08.708 --> 00:54:09.909
- You scared me. What? - There's fish.

1259
00:54:10.278 --> 00:54:11.739
- What? - There is fish.

1260
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:13.548
- Really? - You didn't see it?

1261
00:54:14.208 --> 00:54:15.648
Am I the only one seeing it?

1262
00:54:15.648 --> 00:54:16.679
(Jin Woon quickly gets ready to dive.)

1263
00:54:16.679 --> 00:54:18.318
(Is it here somewhere?)

1264
00:54:18.318 --> 00:54:19.648
(Looking around)

1265
00:54:21.088 --> 00:54:22.789
(Kang Nam dives in too.)

1266
00:54:23.858 --> 00:54:25.019
(I'm right here.)

1267
00:54:26.059 --> 00:54:28.228
(Will it be Kang Nam...)

1268
00:54:28.228 --> 00:54:29.699
(or Jin Woon?)

1269
00:54:31.128 --> 00:54:32.228
(He aims...)

1270
00:54:32.228 --> 00:54:34.998
(and shoots.)

1271
00:54:35.898 --> 00:54:37.898
(They give it a try at the same time.)

1272
00:54:39.708 --> 00:54:40.739
I got it!

1273
00:54:40.739 --> 00:54:41.739
(He caught the silver fish!)

1274
00:54:42.239 --> 00:54:44.309
- I got it! - Nice!

1275
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:45.449
Look!

1276
00:54:46.978 --> 00:54:49.219
- I got it! - How did you catch it?

1277
00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:50.519
(Kang Nam successfully catches a fish.)

1278
00:54:50.519 --> 00:54:51.579
(Flagtail lives in brackish water zone.)

1279
00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:52.688
That's so cool.

1280
00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:55.119
How did you catch it?

1281
00:54:55.119 --> 00:54:56.159
I pierced it.

1282
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:58.088
- Just like this? - Yes.

1283
00:54:59.088 --> 00:55:00.329
Gosh. That's cool.

1284
00:55:00.329 --> 00:55:01.358
(Kang Nam is all revved up to hunt.)

1285
00:55:01.358 --> 00:55:02.358
Let me touch...

1286
00:55:04.599 --> 00:55:06.869
(It looks like she got hit by a palm blast.)

1287
00:55:08.068 --> 00:55:09.668
(While Kang Nam is excited about his catch...)

1288
00:55:10.068 --> 00:55:11.269
I'll catch the big one.

1289
00:55:13.938 --> 00:55:16.539
(The unlucky Jin Woon seems discouraged.)

1290
00:55:16.539 --> 00:55:17.938
(He clenches his teeth.)

1291
00:55:19.579 --> 00:55:21.579
Jin Woon, there's a big one. It's really big.

1292
00:55:22.179 --> 00:55:23.179
It's big.

1293
00:55:24.119 --> 00:55:25.688
There's a big one.

1294
00:55:25.688 --> 00:55:26.688
(Jin Woon staggers to the spot Kang Nam pointed.)

1295
00:55:26.688 --> 00:55:27.889
- Is it really big? - Yes.

1296
00:55:27.889 --> 00:55:29.159
(Stumbling)

1297
00:55:31.989 --> 00:55:33.259
(I won't let it escape.)

1298
00:55:35.188 --> 00:55:36.599
(Swimming leisurely)

1299
00:55:38.759 --> 00:55:40.469
(A determined...)

1300
00:55:40.469 --> 00:55:41.898
(blow)

1301
00:55:42.099 --> 00:55:43.699
(As soon as he throws the harpoon,)

1302
00:55:43.699 --> 00:55:46.009
(he staggers again.)

1303

(Does Jin Woon have weak legs?)

1304
00:55:49.438 --> 00:55:51.378
(Where did it go?)

1305
00:55:52.978 --> 00:55:54.909
(It looks like he won't catch anything today.)

1306
00:55:55.248 --> 00:55:56.679
- There's another one. - Where?

1307
00:55:56.679 --> 00:55:58.619
Right there.

1308
00:55:58.619 --> 00:55:59.989
(Today's food is all on the tips of Bo Mi's fingers.)

1309
00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.188
(Kang Nam quickly dives in.)

1310
00:56:02.619 --> 00:56:03.889
(Watching carefully)

1311
00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:05.728
(Piercing)

1312
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:07.688
Gosh, that's amazing.

1313
00:56:07.688 --> 00:56:08.759
Did you catch it?

1314
00:56:08.929 --> 00:56:10.528
Yes! We have two fish!

1315
00:56:10.528 --> 00:56:12.298
(The strong man, Kang Nam)

1316
00:56:12.298 --> 00:56:13.498
(And)

1317
00:56:13.498 --> 00:56:16.269
(The really unlucky man, Jin Woon)

1318
00:56:17.039 --> 00:56:19.309
There are so many, but I haven't caught any.

1319
00:56:20.608 --> 00:56:21.909
(How did you feel at the time?)

1320
00:56:21.909 --> 00:56:24.778
Kang Nam is starting to show what he can do.

1321
00:56:25.409 --> 00:56:26.708
But I haven't done anything.

1322
00:56:27.409 --> 00:56:28.449
That's what I thought at the time.

1323
00:56:28.449 --> 00:56:31.548
(His body is too ripped to not catch anything.)

1324
00:56:32.719 --> 00:56:34.188
You can catch fish!

1325
00:56:34.989 --> 00:56:35.989
You can do it!

1326
00:56:35.989 --> 00:56:38.088
(Bo Mi cheers Jin Woon up with a loud voice.)

1327
00:56:38.358 --> 00:56:40.028
Good luck!

1328
00:56:40.358 --> 00:56:44.128
(Bo Mi's solo concert in Fiji)

1329
00:56:44.398 --> 00:56:47.398
(She begins with a medley of Apink's songs.)

1330
00:56:49.898 --> 00:56:52.409
(Bo Mi's 7th self, the clown, appears.)

1331
00:56:52.539 --> 00:56:53.539
That's it.

1332
00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:57.409
(She does the Hawaiian hula dance,)

1333
00:56:57.409 --> 00:57:00.608
(and dances to a punk rock song. Her dance goes beyond genres.)

1334
00:57:00.608 --> 00:57:03.519
(Gosh, I gave my all.)

1335
00:57:05.119 --> 00:57:06.548
(Bo Mi is gone.)

1336
00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:08.418
("Bo Mi's Solo Concert Is Successful")

1337
00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:12.528
Kang Nam caught two of my friends.

1338
00:57:14.659 --> 00:57:15.858
I'm actually a mermaid.

1339
00:57:17.528 --> 00:57:20.068
(This is the place where my friends hang out.)

1340
00:57:20.898 --> 00:57:22.769
I had a fight with my friends earlier.

1341
00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:25.539
We are not on good terms, so I can't catch them.

1342
00:57:27.338 --> 00:57:29.108
(Bo Mi, you can stop now.)

1343
00:57:31.539 --> 00:57:33.509
(Bo Mi, the clown, turns into a mermaid.)

1344
00:57:33.509 --> 00:57:34.949
Flapping, flapping.

1345
00:57:36.278 --> 00:57:37.719
(So the mermaid of Fiji...)

1346
00:57:37.719 --> 00:57:40.418
(lived happily ever after.)

1347
00:57:41.619 --> 00:57:43.389
(Why is she doing that?)

1348
00:57:43.389 --> 00:57:44.958
My gosh. It's getting dark.

1349
00:57:45.489 --> 00:57:46.489
Kang Nam!

1350
00:57:46.958 --> 00:57:47.958
(He's still engrossed in hunting.)

1351
00:57:47.958 --> 00:57:50.599
What? Did you call me?

1352
00:57:50.599 --> 00:57:51.699
It's getting dark now.

1353
00:57:54.168 --> 00:57:56.298
They tried hard to hunt fish in the cold waterfall,

1354
00:57:56.398 --> 00:57:59.009
but they only caught two tiny fish.

1355

Tae Gon and Dam are the Tribe's last ray of hope.

1356
00:58:04.878 --> 00:58:07.309
The weather has cleared up completely.

1357
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:09.248
- The weather got much better. - This is great.

1358
00:58:09.248 --> 00:58:11.818
(They've been fishing for 6 hours. It's the clearest sky today.)

1359
00:58:11.818 --> 00:58:15.289
(Since lures gleam with sunlight, they're perfect to attract fish.)

1360
00:58:15.289 --> 00:58:18.059
(The king of hope begins to fight his battle again.)

1361
00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:20.289
(He is lost in thought next to the fishing rod.)

1362
00:58:20.289 --> 00:58:21.289
(He's determined.)

1363
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:24.998
When you're not catching anything, you need to switch the lures...

1364
00:58:25.259 --> 00:58:26.929
once in either 30 minutes or 1 hour.

1365
00:58:29.269 --> 00:58:30.699
- My gosh. Look at the birds! - What? What is it?

1366
00:58:30.699 --> 00:58:31.699
Those are real birds!

1367
00:58:32.369 --> 00:58:33.369
They are flocks of them.

1368
00:58:33.809 --> 00:58:36.539
- They probably saw fish over there. - I see.

1369
00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:38.509
Look. How could there be so many of birds over there?

1370
00:58:38.509 --> 00:58:40.409
- They can just snatch fish there. - Hurry!

1371
00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:41.809
- We must hurry. - Crank up the speed!

1372
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:43.519
(The boat speeds up.)

1373
00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:46.088
- Look! There are birds all over. - Nice, nice. We got this.

1374
00:58:46.418 --> 00:58:47.548
- There are so many birds. - Okay.

1375
00:58:47.548 --> 00:58:48.918
(This is going to be amazing.)

1376
00:58:48.918 --> 00:58:49.918
That's fantastic.

1377
00:58:50.889 --> 00:58:51.889
It's swarming with fish.

1378
00:58:52.188 --> 00:58:53.989
- Hey, that's a tuna over there. - My goodness!

1379
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:55.858
(Patting his arms)

1380
00:58:55.858 --> 00:58:57.659
(They're in a frenzy of excitement.)

1381
00:58:58.699 --> 00:58:59.699
Was that a tuna?

1382
00:59:01.498 --> 00:59:02.998
I'm 100 percent sure it was a tuna.

1383
00:59:03.898 --> 00:59:06.039
(There's another one far away from them.)

1384
00:59:06.039 --> 00:59:07.969
A fish as massive as this jumped over the water.

1385
00:59:08.539 --> 00:59:11.239
They're hunting for food. Look at the birds over there.

1386
00:59:12.108 --> 00:59:13.608
The birds are hunting for food.

1387
00:59:13.608 --> 00:59:16.719
- They went into the water. Look. - They did. My goodness.

1388
00:59:17.918 --> 00:59:19.048
- What was that? - It jumped.

1389
00:59:19.048 --> 00:59:20.918
(The fish get away by jumping over the water.)

1390
00:59:20.918 --> 00:59:22.289
They're trying to get away.

1391
00:59:22.619 --> 00:59:24.188
- What was that about? - They're trying to get away.

1392
00:59:24.188 --> 00:59:25.688
Hey, get ready. Stay on alert.

1393
00:59:25.688 --> 00:59:26.989
I should prepare myself.

1394
00:59:27.858 --> 00:59:30.599
I see them jumping. That means there must be a lot of fish.

1395
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:34.228
They bit!

1396
00:59:34.228 --> 00:59:35.269
(They bit both rods.)

1397
00:59:36.068 --> 00:59:37.068
(Let's go.)

1398
00:59:37.068 --> 00:59:38.969
- They bit both lures. - It's both.

1399
00:59:38.969 --> 00:59:40.509
(They must hold the rods.)

1400
00:59:40.509 --> 00:59:42.278
They bit the bait. They bit. What should we do?

1401
00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:44.338
(They swiftly array for the battle.)

1402
00:59:44.338 --> 00:59:47.478
Look at that! It's jumping! We got the fish.

1403
00:59:47.478 --> 00:59:51.679
- What should I do? It's jumping! - Hold it.

1404
00:59:52.318 --> 00:59:53.418
The fish is right here.

1405
00:59:53.418 --> 00:59:54.688
(Tae Gon tackles the first one.)

1406
00:59:54.688 --> 00:59:56.858
Hey, here. Look.

1407
00:59:57.688 --> 00:59:58.989
It got away.

1408
00:59:58.989 --> 01:00:00.789
- No, no. This one didn't. - This one still has the fish.

1409
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:02.898
- Step back. Move back. - It got away.

1410
01:00:02.898 --> 01:00:04.099
(Now, it's 1 against 1.)

1411
01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:06.369
- We got it after changing the lure. - This is amazing.

1412
01:00:06.528 --> 01:00:09.369
- I told you it'd work. - I saw the fish jump! I saw it!

1413
01:00:09.438 --> 01:00:10.769
- Hold on. - You can't let it get away.

1414
01:00:10.769 --> 01:00:13.269
Give me a second. This fish bit the lure. Let me take it slow.

1415
01:00:13.269 --> 01:00:14.269
I saw it jump. I saw it!

1416
01:00:14.269 --> 01:00:15.809
(He's going to reel now.)

1417
01:00:15.809 --> 01:00:17.909
(It's a combination of a technique and power.)

1418
01:00:17.909 --> 01:00:19.648
I saw it jump over the water!

1419
01:00:19.778 --> 01:00:23.079
It was in the water and out of it. I saw it!

1420
01:00:23.148 --> 01:00:24.918
- I saw it. - Give me a minute.

1421
01:00:25.019 --> 01:00:27.289
- It was so big. - Hold on.

1422
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:29.418
- What? What is it? Did it get away? - Wait.

1423
01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.259
I don't feel the fish resisting anymore.

1424
01:00:31.259 --> 01:00:33.429
- No, I still have it. - You have it? Good, good.

1425
01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.659
(His battle resumes.)

1426
01:00:34.659 --> 01:00:36.659
I still have it. I do, but...

1427
01:00:37.128 --> 01:00:39.128
- it's not that big. - It's not?

1428
01:00:39.128 --> 01:00:41.099
- No. - But it looked massive.

1429
01:00:41.699 --> 01:00:42.798
I still have it, but...

1430
01:00:43.769 --> 01:00:45.398
- Here it is. - There it is!

1431
01:00:45.398 --> 01:00:47.608
It's right there! It's so close.

1432
01:00:47.608 --> 01:00:48.608
(Its silhouette is blurry.)

1433
01:00:48.608 --> 01:00:49.778
(It's about to reveal itself.)

1434
01:00:49.778 --> 01:00:52.009
It's right there! It's so close.

1435
01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:54.708
I got it.

1436
01:00:55.519 --> 01:00:58.048
- Slowly, slowly. - Take your time. Calm down.

1437
01:00:58.418 --> 01:01:02.019
- Slowly. It's a dorado! - What was it?

1438
01:01:02.019 --> 01:01:03.458
(A dorado?)

1439
01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:04.789
- It's a dorado. - A dorado?

1440
01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:06.889
- I think it's a dorado. - Hurrah!

1441
01:01:06.889 --> 01:01:08.628
- Yes! It's a dorado. - Hurrah!

1442
01:01:08.628 --> 01:01:10.798
- Dorados are really tasty. - Sweet!

1443
01:01:10.798 --> 01:01:13.298
- Tasty dorados! - Hey, keep it down!

1444
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:15.969
(All of his focus is on the power struggle.)

1445
01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:17.068
You're so loud.

1446
01:01:17.798 --> 01:01:20.108
I see it now. Tae Gon, it's big.

1447
01:01:20.509 --> 01:01:22.778
When I tell you to scoop, do it right away.

1448
01:01:22.778 --> 01:01:25.239
- Tae Gon, do I get the gill? - Yes.

1449
01:01:25.239 --> 01:01:27.878
(Tae Gon is about to restore his reputation as the king of fishing.)

1450
01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:30.019
I got this. Scoop it up at once.

1451
01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:32.188
- What do I do? It's my first time. - This fish...

1452
01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.889
- It's going to resist. - Okay.

1453
01:01:34.519 --> 01:01:36.389
- Look at the dorado. - Okay.

1454
01:01:36.389 --> 01:01:37.789
(It's quite big.)

1455
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:40.088
Look at the dorado. Unbelievable. I caught a dorado at last.

1456
01:01:40.858 --> 01:01:42.798
- Quiet. The last step is important. - Tae Gon.

1457
01:01:42.798 --> 01:01:44.528
What do I do? Do I aim at the gill?

1458
01:01:44.528 --> 01:01:47.969
- Ask Jake to help. - Jake.

1459
01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:49.998
(The expert will shoot the harpoon to wrap up.)

1460
01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:50.998
Jake is good at it.

1461
01:01:52.139 --> 01:01:53.168
I can't believe it.

1462
01:01:54.438 --> 01:01:55.509
This...

1463
01:01:55.509 --> 01:01:56.509
(The dorado is still full of energy.)

1464
01:01:57.009 --> 01:01:58.809
- Hey, move aside. Back up a bit. - We should pull this.

1465
01:01:58.809 --> 01:02:01.909
- Do I grab this? My goodness. - Hold the rod. Hold it.

1466
01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:03.648
(Floundering)

1467
01:02:04.318 --> 01:02:05.789
- My goodness. - Hold it.

1468
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:06.789
Hold the rod.

1469
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:07.918
(The fish tries to escape.)

1470
01:02:07.918 --> 01:02:09.358
It's going to spit out the needle.

1471
01:02:10.318 --> 01:02:11.389
(It's not an easy match.)

1472
01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:13.429
It's big! My gosh.

1473
01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.389
(There's a chance they might miss it right under their nose.)

1474
01:02:15.389 --> 01:02:16.759
- Make sure you hold the rod. - Goodness.

1475
01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:18.498
If we lose it,

1476
01:02:19.228 --> 01:02:20.898
we would be back to square one.

1477
01:02:21.668 --> 01:02:22.699
I'd have nothing to say.

1478
01:02:23.398 --> 01:02:25.969
To make sure we didn't lose the fish,

1479
01:02:25.969 --> 01:02:27.539
I kept telling myself that I should calm down.

1480
01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:28.809
- Make sure you hold the rod. - Goodness.

1481
01:02:28.809 --> 01:02:30.878
(The fish was looking for a chance to escape,)

1482
01:02:30.878 --> 01:02:32.509
(and made the last-ditch effort.)

1483
01:02:33.179 --> 01:02:34.509
- It's big! My gosh. - Hold it.

1484
01:02:34.509 --> 01:02:38.219
(The fishing enthusiast of 20 year versus a massive dorado)

1485
01:02:38.219 --> 01:02:40.719
(At that moment)

1486
01:02:41.248 --> 01:02:43.358
- Make sure you hold the rod. - Goodness.

1487
01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:44.759
(He shoots...)

1488
01:02:44.759 --> 01:02:46.259
(and pulls it up.)

1489
01:02:49.059 --> 01:02:50.759
(He came,)

1490
01:02:50.759 --> 01:02:51.898
(he saw,)

1491
01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:54.028
(and he conquered.)

1492
01:02:54.599 --> 01:02:56.469
Don't get close to the fish.

1493
01:02:56.869 --> 01:03:00.539
Don't approach. It's dangerous. Don't go near it.

1494
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:03.809
- Wait. - I've never seen that fish before.

1495
01:03:03.809 --> 01:03:04.809
It's a dorado.

1496
01:03:04.809 --> 01:03:06.148
(The expert gets it under control for safety reasons.)

1497
01:03:06.148 --> 01:03:08.648
Jake is going to get it under control.

1498
01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:10.219
Hold on.

1499
01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:11.219
(It's a humongous fish.)

1500
01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:15.248
Jake is going to kill it right away.

1501
01:03:15.818 --> 01:03:16.858
Otherwise, we'll be in danger.

1502
01:03:17.759 --> 01:03:18.759
Nice job, Jake.

1503
01:03:18.759 --> 01:03:20.429
(He passes the fish onto Tae Gon.)

1504
01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.998
(It's heavy.)

1505
01:03:22.998 --> 01:03:25.398
(They successfully caught a dorado.)

1506
01:03:27.668 --> 01:03:29.298
- Hurrah! - A dorado!

1507
01:03:29.298 --> 01:03:30.539
Yes!

1508
01:03:30.539 --> 01:03:32.909
(Oh, dorado!)

1509
01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:36.778
(Unable to hold in his emotion, he bellows.)

1510
01:03:36.778 --> 01:03:38.909
Oh, spirits!

1511
01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:43.778
This is massive. Look at the color. I've never seen such a color.

1512
01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:45.688
(It's a peculiar color, mixed with many different colors.)

1513
01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:48.818
(The fruit of persistence, patience, skills, and help of the universe)

1514
01:03:48.818 --> 01:03:50.318
Did anyone catch a dorado on this show?

1515
01:03:50.318 --> 01:03:52.289
No. This is my first time seeing it.

1516
01:03:52.489 --> 01:03:54.628
- Is this the 1st time? - It's my 1st time hearing the name.

1517
01:03:54.628 --> 01:03:56.159
This is a dorado.

1518
01:03:56.958 --> 01:04:00.599
This fish is known to spit out the hook and resist.

1519
01:04:01.298 --> 01:04:03.039
- You saw it, didn't you? - That's why it jumped.

1520
01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.599
When it jumps near the boat,

1521
01:04:04.599 --> 01:04:05.639
that's when the hook usually gets loose.

1522
01:04:06.438 --> 01:04:08.409
But luckily, the hook didn't get loose.

1523
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:11.208
So Jake did a great job pulling it out of the water.

1524
01:04:11.409 --> 01:04:13.278
- We'd have lost it without him. - The thing is...

1525
01:04:13.278 --> 01:04:15.309
that it gets away if we don't get it at our first try.

1526
01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:16.818
The fish spits out the hook.

1527
01:04:18.048 --> 01:04:19.048
(They're blown away.)

1528
01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:25.259
(They can't help but feel proud of themselves.)

1529
01:04:25.389 --> 01:04:29.199
(They have been waiting for this moment for a long time.)

1530
01:04:30.298 --> 01:04:33.128
Before I knew it, I felt so overwhelmed.

1531
01:04:33.498 --> 01:04:35.398
I said, "I can't believe I caught a dorado."

1532
01:04:35.398 --> 01:04:37.869
(Without realizing, he blurted out,)

1533
01:04:37.869 --> 01:04:40.409
(I caught a dorado at last.)

1534
01:04:41.608 --> 01:04:44.509
The moment I caught the fish, I stared at the sky.

1535
01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:46.679
I thanked the spirits.

1536
01:04:46.679 --> 01:04:47.708
(Thank you.)

1537
01:04:48.778 --> 01:04:52.019
I got to catch a fish that I've been dreaming of catching on the show.

1538
01:04:52.519 --> 01:04:57.219
More than anything, I'm happy that I caught such a big fish here.

1539
01:04:57.219 --> 01:04:58.619
(I was always at a low point in the jungle.)

1540
01:04:58.789 --> 01:05:01.858
I was ecstatic. I was smiling from ear to ear.

1541
01:05:01.858 --> 01:05:02.858
(He gets teary-eyed.)

1542
01:05:04.059 --> 01:05:07.168
(To catch one dorado,)

1543
01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:10.769
(he must have been crying from 5 years ago.)

1544
01:05:10.769 --> 01:05:12.269
(I promise I'll lead an honest life now.)

1545
01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:15.838
Out of all the fishing trips I've gone on,

1546
01:05:16.539 --> 01:05:18.539
this trip shocked me the most that...

1547
01:05:18.878 --> 01:05:21.909
the feeling still lingers in my heart. I was really surprised.

1548
01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:28.088
I think it will be a life-long memory for Tae Gon and me.

1549
01:05:28.088 --> 01:05:29.358
That's how deeply I was moved by it.

1550
01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:33.389
(We did it!)

1551
01:05:36.798 --> 01:05:39.869
(Tae Gon's dream, catching the dorado, ends with a happy ending.)

1552
01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.398
It feels rewarding today.

1553
01:05:41.398 --> 01:05:42.498
(Tae Gon's dream, catching the dorado, ends with a happy ending.)

1554
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:45.099
(The whole Tribe gathers at 7pm.)

1555
01:05:45.099 --> 01:05:46.539
My goodness, my face.

1556
01:05:47.139 --> 01:05:48.639
Please make me look pretty on the screen.

1557
01:05:49.509 --> 01:05:50.909
There's nothing I can do, right?

1558
01:05:51.409 --> 01:05:53.208
- Anything to make you look better? - Yes.

1559
01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:56.619
Bo Mi, you look so pretty. I'm serious. You look amazing.

1560
01:05:57.918 --> 01:06:00.748
- But you don't look Korean though. - Let me see.

1561
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:03.119
- Hey, bring me that here. - Right now...

1562
01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:04.759
I want to see too.

1563
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:08.389
- We can get anything. - We can switch later.

1564
01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.659
- You're so pretty. - You look exactly like yourself.

1565
01:06:12.228 --> 01:06:14.099
- Cho Rong. - "You look exactly like yourself."

1566
01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:16.199
- What do you mean? - What is she getting at?

1567
01:06:16.438 --> 01:06:17.798
I wonder what she meant by that.

1568
01:06:17.798 --> 01:06:20.108
- On the screen, you look the same. - Is that good or bad?

1569
01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:22.208
(Bo Mi is wearing no makeup.)

1570
01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:24.208
- If she looks like herself... - I can see everything on her skin.

1571
01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.278
What can you see?

1572
01:06:25.278 --> 01:06:26.349
I can clearly see your skin.

1573
01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:28.208
I'm doomed.

1574
01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:30.648
Cho Rong, sit down over there. Ask Bo Mi to come here.

1575
01:06:30.719 --> 01:06:32.248
- Cho Rong, sit here. - No, I'm sorry.

1576
01:06:32.248 --> 01:06:34.849
We'll tell you how you look exactly on the screen. Hey, Cho Rong.

1577
01:06:38.318 --> 01:06:39.329
(Pretending to be pretty)

1578
01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.358
She's pretty.

1579
01:06:41.528 --> 01:06:45.099
(Seriously? She's pretty.)

1580
01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:47.568
- Do I look pretty like her? - Of course.

1581
01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:49.798
- Isn't she pretty? - You look pretty too.

1582
01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:50.869
It's okay.

1583
01:06:51.298 --> 01:06:53.668
- Is it because it's not me? - You look very pretty.

1584
01:06:55.809 --> 01:06:58.679
(Fans, please be generous with me.)

1585
01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:01.809
What did you do today?

1586
01:07:02.679 --> 01:07:03.679
Where did you go?

1587
01:07:03.679 --> 01:07:06.019
We went to two places.

1588
01:07:06.019 --> 01:07:07.548
We went to the water slide.

1589
01:07:07.548 --> 01:07:10.188
I went on the water slide...

1590
01:07:10.188 --> 01:07:11.289
and got bruised.

1591
01:07:11.289 --> 01:07:13.228
- I see. - She's talking about herself.

1592
01:07:13.228 --> 01:07:15.759
- We know. - What is she supposed to say?

1593
01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:17.529
What about food?

1594
01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:20.069
We don't have food.

1595
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:22.439
- Good job. - I got bruised a lot.

1596
01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:23.868
- You got bruised? - I see.

1597
01:07:23.868 --> 01:07:26.609
- Kang Nam, do you have food? - We caught something.

1598
01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.569
- What? - We went to a waterfall.

1599
01:07:28.569 --> 01:07:30.338
- 3 waterfalls. - 3 waterfalls.

1600
01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.378
We went to the waterfall and the fish were this big.

1601
01:07:32.378 --> 01:07:34.179
(The fish were this big.)

1602
01:07:34.179 --> 01:07:36.618
- Did you catch any? - We caught two of them.

1603
01:07:36.618 --> 01:07:37.719
Where are they?

1604
01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:40.319
They're not this big. They're like this.

1605
01:07:40.319 --> 01:07:41.948
He's lying.

1606
01:07:41.948 --> 01:07:43.389
They keep getting smaller.

1607
01:07:43.389 --> 01:07:44.458
They're actually this big.

1608
01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:47.529
(He gets caught lying.)

1609
01:07:47.729 --> 01:07:49.458
- They're this big. - This big?

1610
01:07:49.529 --> 01:07:51.798
- Who's this for? - It's for Bo Mi.

1611
01:07:51.798 --> 01:07:54.569
You guys went fishing too. Where's the marlin?

1612
01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:56.399
We went fishing for marlin.

1613
01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:59.908
We were on the boat for seven hours.

1614
01:07:59.908 --> 01:08:00.939
(Listen to our story.)

1615
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:03.179
- And? - We didn't get a marlin.

1616
01:08:03.439 --> 01:08:04.679
- It's not a marlin. - However,

1617
01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:08.378
this is a type of fish all fishermen know.

1618
01:08:08.578 --> 01:08:09.578
It's called a dolphinfish.

1619
01:08:09.578 --> 01:08:11.048
- A dolphinfish? - Dolphinfish?

1620
01:08:11.048 --> 01:08:12.689
- Have you heard of it? - A dolphin?

1621
01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.048
(What's a dolphinfish?)

1622
01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.158
- A dolphinfish? - How big is it?

1623
01:08:16.618 --> 01:08:19.458
- You can look at it and be shocked. - You'll be shocked.

1624
01:08:19.458 --> 01:08:20.588
It must be big.

1625
01:08:20.588 --> 01:08:22.059
- Let's go. - How big is it?

1626
01:08:22.059 --> 01:08:23.259
- I'm hungry. - I haven't heard of it before.

1627
01:08:23.259 --> 01:08:24.958
I don't know if we can lift it.

1628
01:08:24.958 --> 01:08:26.269
- I can help. - It's that big?

1629
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.868
It might be small.

1630
01:08:27.868 --> 01:08:28.899
How can it be...

1631
01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:30.168
(They're somewhat doubtful.)

1632
01:08:30.168 --> 01:08:33.269
- Oh, my. - My gosh.

1633
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:34.868
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1634
01:08:36.878 --> 01:08:39.649
- Oh, my. - My gosh.

1635
01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:40.948
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1636
01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:44.578
(This is the dolphinfish.)

1637
01:08:45.179 --> 01:08:46.988
- This is unbelievable. - What's that?

1638
01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:48.048
For real?

1639
01:08:48.748 --> 01:08:50.958
I was reeling it in...

1640
01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:54.029
- and was hoping for a dolphinfish. - He's a true fisherman.

1641
01:08:54.828 --> 01:08:56.259
It looks like a whale.

1642
01:08:56.259 --> 01:08:57.828
If you look at the front,

1643
01:08:58.599 --> 01:08:59.868
- it's sharp. - How do we eat it?

1644
01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:01.198
- Right. - So...

1645
01:09:01.628 --> 01:09:03.969
- it has no resistance. - It must be so fast.

1646
01:09:03.969 --> 01:09:05.868
- It swims really fast. - It must.

1647
01:09:06.738 --> 01:09:09.009
This is the first time a dolphinfish was caught in the jungle.

1648
01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.809
This fancy-looking fish is...

1649
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:14.349
a dolphinfish that's popular in other countries.

1650
01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:18.078
In Hawaii, they call it mahi-mahi which means "very strong".

1651
01:09:18.078 --> 01:09:21.588
They can be 2.1m long and weigh 40kg.

1652
01:09:21.588 --> 01:09:22.719
It's a big fish...

1653
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:26.288
found in Pacific, Atlantic, and Korea's southern coast.

1654
01:09:26.488 --> 01:09:28.828
They can jump as high as 5m...

1655
01:09:28.828 --> 01:09:31.559
and swim at a speed of 60km per hour.

1656
01:09:31.559 --> 01:09:33.529
They're called the acrobats of the sea.

1657
01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:36.168
They're every fisherman's dream since they're so hard to catch.

1658
01:09:37.069 --> 01:09:40.708
Since it was so hard to catch, does it taste good too?

1659
01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:45.238
- Mahi-mahi. This is so tasty. - What is it?

1660
01:09:45.679 --> 01:09:48.078
This is so tasty. They eat this a lot in Hawaii.

1661
01:09:48.078 --> 01:09:49.979
- This is tasty. - If you look here,

1662
01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:51.479
they open this up when they hunt.

1663
01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:52.548
(This opens up.)

1664
01:09:52.548 --> 01:09:53.788
- That's so cool. - It's cool, right?

1665
01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:57.088
When it opens up, that's how it looks.

1666
01:09:57.618 --> 01:09:59.859
- It's nicer when it's alive. - It's a mohawk.

1667
01:10:00.259 --> 01:10:02.859
It's popular because it tastes good.

1668
01:10:03.059 --> 01:10:05.399
- The taste? - This is the fin.

1669
01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:09.698
I'm not very confident, but I'll try to cut it up.

1670
01:10:09.698 --> 01:10:10.838
- Can we eat it raw? - Yes.

1671
01:10:11.269 --> 01:10:12.969
It's been fermented well.

1672
01:10:12.969 --> 01:10:15.538
We have to compromise with staff though.

1673
01:10:15.538 --> 01:10:17.908
- We need many things. - We're going to eat it raw.

1674
01:10:17.908 --> 01:10:20.479
We need a knife first.

1675
01:10:20.479 --> 01:10:22.378
- It's long. - We also need a cutting board.

1676
01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:26.349
- We need tools. - We need tools to cut up a fish.

1677
01:10:26.649 --> 01:10:28.748
Are you going to give us chili pepper paste and soy sauce?

1678
01:10:28.748 --> 01:10:31.458
Wasabi. We need to dip it in wasabi.

1679
01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:32.628
(It tastes good with wasabi.)

1680
01:10:33.288 --> 01:10:35.128
- We'll give you some fish. - Fish...

1681
01:10:35.128 --> 01:10:36.429
It's a good compromise.

1682
01:10:36.429 --> 01:10:38.359
We'll eat half and give you the other half.

1683
01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:40.599
You can't eat this in Korea.

1684
01:10:40.599 --> 01:10:42.298
It's a dolphinfish.

1685
01:10:42.298 --> 01:10:45.168
- We can give you the tools... - All right.

1686
01:10:45.168 --> 01:10:47.168
- but not the sauces. - The chili pepper paste?

1687
01:10:47.168 --> 01:10:49.179
- Not after Cho Rong acts cute. - What are you saying?

1688
01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:50.979
He likes it when Cho Rong acts cute.

1689
01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:52.078
Act cute.

1690
01:10:52.078 --> 01:10:53.578
- Cho Rong. - What are you doing?

1691
01:10:53.578 --> 01:10:54.748
We're depending on it...

1692
01:10:54.748 --> 01:10:55.878
Please act cute.

1693
01:10:55.878 --> 01:10:57.679
- to get sauce. - People won't like me.

1694
01:10:57.679 --> 01:10:58.819
- That's not true. - Please show us.

1695
01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:00.048
- Show us. - Do it.

1696
01:11:00.519 --> 01:11:02.918
- Show us. - I'm going to fish by myself.

1697
01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:07.488
(This is her trademark.)

1698
01:11:07.488 --> 01:11:08.529
Please give it to us.

1699
01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:12.099
(I've seen that too many times.)

1700
01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.529
His ears got red.

1701
01:11:13.529 --> 01:11:15.939
- Bo Mi, you too. Hurry. - Their fans are watching.

1702
01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.198
- Bo Mi. - Show them.

1703
01:11:18.698 --> 01:11:20.069
(Director)

1704
01:11:20.069 --> 01:11:22.809
(Wasabi and chili pepper paste)

1705
01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:23.809
Is that acting cute?

1706
01:11:24.078 --> 01:11:25.679
That was Lee Gey In.

1707
01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.078
(She's going to regret this for the rest of her life.)

1708
01:11:27.078 --> 01:11:29.179
I have a request. Our staff...

1709
01:11:29.179 --> 01:11:32.078
- What is it? - wants to see this. Gorilla Yoon.

1710
01:11:32.078 --> 01:11:33.088
I'll do it.

1711
01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:34.649
(I'll do it!)

1712
01:11:34.649 --> 01:11:35.689
- Really? - "Gorilla Yoon"?

1713
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:37.118
Gorilla Yoon.

1714
01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.788
- It's been a while. - You have to move back.

1715
01:11:38.788 --> 01:11:39.828
Okay.

1716
01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:42.529
- Watch the water. - She's doing this for the sauce.

1717
01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:44.958
- It's for the sauce. - This is the ground.

1718
01:11:45.498 --> 01:11:47.368
- I'll do it for a long time. - I don't know anymore.

1719
01:11:47.769 --> 01:11:48.838
(She gets ready for her legendary imitation.)

1720
01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:50.569
- She's getting into position. - She's getting ready.

1721
01:11:50.569 --> 01:11:52.139
- I don't know anymore. - It's funny already.

1722
01:11:52.738 --> 01:11:55.679
(She's turning on the engine.)

1723
01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:58.408
(She's in an awkward position.)

1724
01:11:58.408 --> 01:12:01.948
(Their expectations go up.)

1725
01:12:02.578 --> 01:12:03.618
(I am...)

1726
01:12:03.618 --> 01:12:08.288
(a gorilla.)

1727
01:12:11.389 --> 01:12:12.389
She's so good.

1728
01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:14.828
(Gorilla Yoon appears.)

1729
01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:19.429
(Gorilla Yoon)

1730
01:12:22.099 --> 01:12:25.609
(She unleashes herself in 3 years.)

1731
01:12:25.609 --> 01:12:33.009
(What just passed us?)

1732
01:12:34.048 --> 01:12:35.378
(Dashing)

1733
01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:40.288
(The gorilla is desperate for some sauce.)

1734
01:12:40.288 --> 01:12:42.458
You have to give us the sauce.

1735
01:12:42.819 --> 01:12:44.088
She deserves it.

1736
01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.588
(She deserves us.)

1737
01:12:45.588 --> 01:12:47.229
She did it twice.

1738
01:12:47.788 --> 01:12:50.698
(Soy sauce for going once and red pepper paste for coming back.)

1739
01:12:50.698 --> 01:12:51.698
You have to give it to her.

1740
01:12:51.698 --> 01:12:52.698
(I am Gorilla Yoon.)

1741
01:12:52.698 --> 01:12:53.769
You were awesome.

1742
01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:56.399
- Is that part of your choreography? - Give it to me.

1743
01:12:56.399 --> 01:12:57.498
- No. - It's not?

1744
01:12:57.769 --> 01:12:59.538
How does she move like that?

1745
01:12:59.538 --> 01:13:01.609
- How did she do it? - She's incredible.

1746
01:13:02.439 --> 01:13:04.809
You have to give it to her.

1747
01:13:04.809 --> 01:13:07.479
We'll give you the sauces.

1748
01:13:07.479 --> 01:13:08.548
(They're deeply satisfied.)

1749
01:13:08.548 --> 01:13:11.349
(Thanks to Bo Mi, they get the sauces.)

1750
01:13:11.349 --> 01:13:13.319
Byung Man's Tribe has a dolphinfish,

1751
01:13:13.719 --> 01:13:16.389
tools to cut it up, and sauces to go with it.

1752
01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:19.458
How would raw dolphinfish taste?

1753
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:22.628
- Hurrah, hurrah, dolphinfish! - Hurrah, hurrah, dolphinfish!

1754
01:13:22.628 --> 01:13:23.658
(Check it out next week.)

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.229
(They gobble it down.)

01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:29.738
(This is a new world.)

1759
01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.769
(It makes Tae Gon act cute too.)

1760
01:13:31.899 --> 01:13:34.338
(They follow it up with fruits.)

1761
01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:36.908
(The fruit lovers show their power.)

1762
01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:39.078
(Are there presents hidden deep in the sea?)

1763
01:13:39.078 --> 01:13:40.708
(Their excitement explodes.)

1764
01:13:42.378 --> 01:13:44.219
(The Law of Jungle, next Friday at 10pm)

1765
01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:45.819
(The moment you believe, you'll be tricked...)

1766
01:13:45.819 --> 01:13:47.418
(and the moment you're tricked, you'll lose.)

1767
01:13:47.819 --> 01:13:49.059
I'm an angel.

1768
01:13:49.389 --> 01:13:50.719
(Turn off the light.)

1769
01:13:50.819 --> 01:13:54.059
(They run, spin, and fight...)

1770
01:13:54.059 --> 01:13:55.059
(to find the angels and devils.)
