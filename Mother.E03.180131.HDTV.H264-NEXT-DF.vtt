<i>If you do that,
it can help you stop crying.</i>

4
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:27.120
<i>Mom!</i>

5
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.270
<i>How disgusting.</i>

6
00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:36.944
<i>Did you find out what her mother
was doing at the time?</i>

7
00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:38.199
- Pardon?
- Also...

8
00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.776
there is a man living with them.

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:42.098
<i>- Are you hoping that Hye Na is dead?
- Whether we find the child or not</i>

10
00:00:42.098 --> 00:00:44.153
I'm going to request an arrest warrant
if I suspect any child abuse.

11
00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:48.632
<i>Right now, Hye Na being dead
is best for all of us.</i>

12

<i>You didn't like your mother, Ms. Kang?</i>

13
00:00:54.073 --> 00:00:55.612
<i>I...</i>

14
00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:58.654
<i>wasn't my mom's real daughter.</i>

15
00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:00.671
Find Soo Jin.

16
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:04.686
<i>Now, you'll be the one
throwing your mom away.</i>

17
00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:07.106
<i>Can you do it?</i>

18
00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:11.543
Call me "Mom."

22
00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:31.722
<i>The house I used to live in
when I was six years old.</i>

23
00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:34.864
That house is still there?

24
00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:38.067
Yeah, probably.

25
00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:41.100
Because they sent me a letter last year.

26
00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.809
Who's there?

27
00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:47.838
Miss Clara.

28
00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.184
From the time I was
six to eight years old...

29
00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:59.149
I lived there with 15 other kids.

30
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.142
And just like those other kids...

31
00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:06.624
I was a child who had been
cast aside by her parents.

32
00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:14.571
<i>Miss Clara...</i>

33
00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:16.714
<i>was quite fat.</i>

34
00:02:16.714 --> 00:02:19.828
<i>So I felt like I'd suffocate
whenever she hugged me tight.</i>

35
00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.288
She always wore this dress
that would flare out

36
00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:28.287
and we'd always hide under her dress
while playing hide and seek.

37
00:02:39.852 --> 00:02:41.070
Oh?

38
00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:50.935
<i>And there, I'd always smell
the faint scent of soap...</i>

39
00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:53.766
<i>and the scent of laundry
that had dried well.</i>

40
00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:58.155
<i>She loved kids
who ate well the most.</i>

41
00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:02.538
Grow up fast, grow up fast.

42
00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:06.173
- Eat a lot, and grow up fast.
<i>- Eat a lot, and grow up fast.</i>

43
00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:11.829
<i>I always thought that she might be trying
to fatten us up to sell us off, but...</i>

44
00:03:26.835 --> 00:03:30.286
Is this... the place?

49
00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:43.221
Right now, Hye Na is...

50
00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:49.207
better off being quietly dead,
for all of us.

51
00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.604
But what if...

52
00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.805
she's not dead?

53
00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:56.481
It'll become troublesome.

54
00:04:56.481 --> 00:04:58.120
Quite, quite troublesome.

55
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.851
According to the medical records
from December 21st...

56
00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:08.356
Hye Na was hit by a baseball
on the day before

57
00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:13.207
was bleeding from her ear,
and bruised her cheekbone.

58
00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:14.897
Is that true?

59
00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:16.243
Yes.

60
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.163
You know...

61
00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:24.952
we looked through all the CCTV footage
from the afternoon of the 20th, onward.

62
00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:29.183
I wonder what time
she was hit by the baseball.

63
00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.233
She's coming home from
school here now, at 2:11 p.m.

64
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.026
And she's leaving
the house now, at 2:48 p.m.

65
00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:46.372
7:16 p.m.

66
00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:48.156
She looks like she's in a good mood.

67
00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:50.723
She doesn't seem like a child
who got hurt, does she?

68
00:05:53.173 --> 00:05:56.260
And at 7:27 p.m., you got home.

69
00:05:56.877 --> 00:05:58.659
And...

70
00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:05.212
at 10:05 p.m.,
you're leaving the house with a man.

71
00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:09.707
I didn't see this man
entering your home

72
00:06:09.707 --> 00:06:11.647
so that means that he was home all day.

73
00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:13.658
It seems that you two
are living together.

74
00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:17.135
He must like baseball.

75
00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:21.865
Here you are,
at exactly 1 a.m.

76
00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:24.413
Where did you go, ma'am?

77
00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:28.699
We'll find out even if
you don't tell us

78
00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.875
but it'll be easier for us
if you just tell us

79
00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.498
and it'll be less of a waste
of civilian tax money...

80
00:06:32.498 --> 00:06:34.351
I went to karaoke.

81
00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:36.440
Oh.

82
00:06:37.454 --> 00:06:40.663
Your child was injured,
and yet you went to karaoke. Okay.

83
00:06:40.663 --> 00:06:43.337
All right, on the next day, at 3:23 p.m.

84
00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.325
you two went to the hospital.

85
00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:50.863
Judging from just this, it seems that
the child was fine when she went home

86
00:06:50.863 --> 00:06:52.747
but came out of the house
with an injured ear.

87
00:06:52.747 --> 00:06:55.089
How does it seem to you?

88
00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:01.168
She got hurt the day before,
before she went home.

89
00:07:01.168 --> 00:07:03.610
This was a weekday, and yet
she didn't even go to school.

90
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.370
At first, we thought that
she'd only gotten a bruise

91
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.558
but when she woke up the next day,
she was bleeding and it was infected.

92
00:07:09.558 --> 00:07:11.959
Do you know how shocked I was?

93
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:14.281
I went to work early in the morning

94
00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:17.866
and yet I barely managed to
come home early to go to the hospital!

95
00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:22.396
I can't even make out her eyes, nose,
and mouth on this small screen

96
00:07:22.396 --> 00:07:25.985
but it seems that you can somehow tell
if my child was injured or not?

97
00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:27.293
Mother.

98
00:07:27.293 --> 00:07:30.930
Then, if you tell us where and when
Hye Na got hit by the baseball

99
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.241
we'll find a witness.
Then you, Mother...

100
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:36.926
Stop calling me that!
It's not like I'm your mother!

101
00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:40.027
I'm sure that you have kids
of your own at home

102
00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:42.207
but would you feel good if
someone kept referring to you

103
00:07:42.207 --> 00:07:43.863
as "Father" at a police station?

104
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.185
Wow.

105
00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:48.635
Oh, I apologize. I...

106
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:53.433
Well, I'm a bit taken aback
when I hear someone call me "Father" too.

107
00:07:54.128 --> 00:07:56.863
Because I'm afraid
they'll ask me for money.

108
00:08:33.228 --> 00:08:34.989
Oh!

109
00:08:36.762 --> 00:08:38.165
Ugh.

110
00:08:38.844 --> 00:08:40.802
Please don't take me away.

111
00:08:40.802 --> 00:08:42.676
I'll eat all my meals well
and be obedient.

112
00:08:42.676 --> 00:08:44.501
So please, let me live here.

113
00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:47.480
Miss Clara.

114
00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:52.297
Please let me...

115
00:08:56.517 --> 00:08:58.232
You can't turn the light on.

116
00:08:58.232 --> 00:09:01.501
People will come for us
if they know we're here.

117
00:09:08.358 --> 00:09:12.018
It seemed to me that your
boyfriend likes baseball.

118
00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.800
Does he, himself, play baseball as well?

119
00:09:17.964 --> 00:09:19.999
If the situation isn't
in your favor, just cry.

120
00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:22.493
That's a more natural reaction
to your kid dying, after all.

121
00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:23.914
And if they ask about me

122
00:09:23.914 --> 00:09:27.765
tell them that I treated her well,
like she was my own daughter.

123
00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:30.084
Are you...

124
00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:33.833
asking me if my Honey threw
the baseball at her, by any chance?

125
00:09:34.434 --> 00:09:36.425
Well, I'm not asserting that
that was the case.

126
00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:39.224
I'm just covering all of my bases.

127
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:44.150
My Honey...

128
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.852
was far nicer to her than her
own biological father was.

129
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:50.541
Last year...

130
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:53.147
he was the one who piggybacked her
and ran to the hospital

131
00:09:53.147 --> 00:09:54.600
when she got sick!

132
00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:02.624
Please calm down, Mother.

133
00:10:03.147 --> 00:10:04.353
Oh, oops.

134
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.626
I mean, um, Madam.

135
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.086
We still have a lot to get through. Um...

136
00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.172
The injury she got when
she fell down the stairs.

137
00:10:13.172 --> 00:10:15.246
The injury she got when
she was burned by hot coffee.

138
00:10:15.246 --> 00:10:17.217
The injury from when
she fell from a tree.

139
00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:19.811
I'm going to thoroughly go through
each and every one of these.

140
00:10:19.811 --> 00:10:21.964
But if you start crying already...

141
00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:41.449
You know, my mom is really
good at making curry.

142
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:43.820
She's good at making other things, too.

143
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.658
Omurice, and donkatsu.

144
00:10:48.488 --> 00:10:52.138
Oh yeah, and my name is Yoon Bok.
Kim Yoon Bok.

145
00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.122
Thank you for the meal!

146
00:11:06.122 --> 00:11:11.525
Thank you, Lord, for blessing us
with another delicious meal today.

147
00:11:11.525 --> 00:11:16.022
Please watch over the other
hungry children in the world.

148
00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:30.103
But you know, Miss Clara.

149
00:11:30.103 --> 00:11:32.488
Who's coming after you?

150
00:11:32.964 --> 00:11:34.467
Yogurt.

151
00:11:36.536 --> 00:11:38.679
Are they bad people?

152
00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:41.035
- A chef.
- A chef?

153
00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:42.655
A hunter.

154
00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:44.776
She's playing a word game.

155
00:11:44.776 --> 00:11:47.759
We'd always play these
word games when we were eating.

156
00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:49.807
Fishbowl.

157
00:11:50.901 --> 00:11:52.248
Harbor.

158
00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:55.533
Um... hole?

159
00:11:57.823 --> 00:11:59.310
Idiot.

160
00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:11.008
"I am the mother who lost
her child yesterday."

161
00:12:11.008 --> 00:12:13.012
"I'm crying so much right now."

162
00:12:13.012 --> 00:12:17.425
"But the police are treating me,
who hasn't been able to eat or sleep"

163
00:12:17.425 --> 00:12:20.305
"like some sort of criminal, as if it
was my fault she disappeared."

164
00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:23.555
"On the day of the accident,
the police arrived on the scene"

165
00:12:23.555 --> 00:12:25.584
"long after the fire trucks
and ambulances"

166
00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:27.941
"and stopped the search operation
after only a couple of hours"

167
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:29.664
"citing the weather as their excuse."

168
00:12:29.664 --> 00:12:30.973
"Even though..."

169
00:12:30.973 --> 00:12:35.094
"my daughter may have been calling
for her mother in the cold ocean."

170
00:12:35.094 --> 00:12:37.525
Detective Lee Chang Geun
at Mooryung Police Station

171
00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:41.497
snubbed me, calling me "Mother" at every
turn, when he's much older than me...

172
00:12:41.497 --> 00:12:42.703
Hey.

173
00:12:43.276 --> 00:12:45.166
How is that snubbing you?

174
00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.714
What else could it be, then?

175
00:12:46.714 --> 00:12:49.521
Everyone else always calls me
"Student" or "Miss" when I go out!

176
00:12:49.521 --> 00:12:51.299
Nobody ever refers to me as "Mother"!

177
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:53.137
Oh, whatever! Just...

178
00:12:53.728 --> 00:12:56.227
say that you were threatened.

179
00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:58.368
Say that they couldn't
even find the kid

180
00:12:58.368 --> 00:13:01.112
and yet they're trying to make you,
the mom, out to be the criminal.

181
00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:02.849
Like that.

182
00:13:04.046 --> 00:13:05.579
Honey!

183
00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:07.864
Can't you stop playing
with that baseball, already?

184
00:13:07.864 --> 00:13:09.967
Or throw it into the ocean,
or something!

185
00:13:11.786 --> 00:13:13.199
<i>Lee Seol Ak.</i>

186
00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:16.257
<i>Born in August 1988,
in Cheongju.</i>

187
00:13:16.257 --> 00:13:18.771
He spent 9 months in a
juvenile detention center

188
00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:20.223
due to a special assault charge
when he was 16

189
00:13:20.223 --> 00:13:23.733
and spent 1 year and 3 months in
prison when he was 18, for arson.

190
00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:27.065
And when he was 23, he was
fined for animal abuse.

191
00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:28.128
300,000 won.

192
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.377
He's 31 years old now.

193
00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.054
But he's been relatively
quiet for the past eight years.

194
00:13:32.054 --> 00:13:34.004
The two things that I
absolutely do not believe

195
00:13:34.004 --> 00:13:36.052
are one, that he quit gambling.

196
00:13:36.052 --> 00:13:39.743
And two, that he doesn't
torment weaker people anymore.

197
00:13:40.733 --> 00:13:42.912
Who did he beat up when he was 16?

198
00:13:42.912 --> 00:13:45.671
Um... the old lady who lived upstairs.

199
00:13:46.342 --> 00:13:49.047
He beat her up with a baseball bat
and broke her rib.

200
00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:50.484
He had 12 charges in all.

201
00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:52.925
Seems like that bastard
really likes baseball.

202
00:13:55.323 --> 00:13:57.017
And where did he start the fire?

203
00:13:57.017 --> 00:14:00.448
It was just a normal house, but he didn't
really have a reason for doing it.

204
00:14:00.448 --> 00:14:02.628
He said that he just did it
because "he was curious."

205
00:14:02.628 --> 00:14:03.815
Crazy bastard.

206
00:14:03.815 --> 00:14:05.227
What about the animal case?

207
00:14:05.227 --> 00:14:09.030
He threw his girlfriend's cat
off a balcony from the 15th floor.

208
00:14:24.315 --> 00:14:26.254
Mom.

209
00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:31.425
Why do people lose their minds
when they get old?

210
00:14:31.425 --> 00:14:35.469
The one thing I don't understand,
no matter how much I think about it...

211
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:42.040
is that, even though there were other
teachers and volunteers who visited us...

212
00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:46.790
she was raising 16 kids at once...

213
00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:51.205
and yet, this huge house
was always so immaculate

214
00:14:51.205 --> 00:14:53.815
and smelled wonderful.

215
00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:03.239
I think she must have completely
exhausted herself back then.

216
00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:07.258
And so, she has nothing left...

217
00:15:07.258 --> 00:15:09.925
and has become a child, I think.

218
00:15:15.219 --> 00:15:16.945
Mom.

219
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.429
I think there's someone outside.

220
00:15:21.998 --> 00:15:23.261
Who?

221
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:27.422
Can't you hear the sound?

222
00:15:30.031 --> 00:15:32.912
The sound that sounds like, "who, who"?

223
00:15:37.762 --> 00:15:39.752
It's called a "Who Bird."

224
00:15:39.752 --> 00:15:41.022
A "Who Bird"?

225
00:15:41.022 --> 00:15:46.137
Every winter it cried, "who, who"
from beyond the hills every night...

226
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.573
so I was really scared
when I first came here.

227
00:15:51.556 --> 00:15:53.373
But it's still here.

228
00:15:57.647 --> 00:15:59.776
Want me to lie with you?

229
00:16:20.684 --> 00:16:23.729
When kids first came here

230
00:16:23.729 --> 00:16:27.765
they all got scared, and three or four
of them would sleep in the same bed.

231
00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:32.459
Were you scared at first, too?

232
00:16:36.465 --> 00:16:38.299
No, Yoon Bok.

233
00:16:40.377 --> 00:16:43.102
I was always scared.

234
00:17:39.388 --> 00:17:42.236
This one is my mom
when she was a baby.

235
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.200
And this is my mom from when
she was three to six years old.

241
00:18:30.987 --> 00:18:34.605
<i>I looked out the window in the morning</i>

242
00:18:34.605 --> 00:18:39.563
<i>and it seemed that there was a large dog
tied in place in front of the house.</i>

243
00:18:40.991 --> 00:18:43.390
<i>I went outside to see what it was</i>

244
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:48.927
<i>and it turned out to be a small girl,
who looked to be about six years old.</i>

245
00:18:54.642 --> 00:18:58.231
<i>She must have been
sitting there for a long time</i>

246
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:01.009
<i>because it was clear that she
had urinated where she was sitting.</i>

247
00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:02.228
Oh, child!

248
00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:09.396
<i>I hurried to hold her, but she was
locked in place by a bicycle lock.</i>

249
00:19:09.396 --> 00:19:11.234
Just wait, Child.

250
00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.559
<i>In my hurry, I tried to
rip her dress to free her</i>

251
00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:17.362
<i>but the child strongly resisted.</i>

252
00:19:21.697 --> 00:19:25.903
<i>A locksmith came
and unlocked the lock.</i>

253
00:19:29.488 --> 00:19:32.699
<i>But even then, the child wouldn't move</i>

254
00:19:32.699 --> 00:19:36.779
<i>so I brought some
scorched rice outside</i>

255
00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:39.325
<i>and sat next to the child.</i>

256
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.898
Here.

<i>The child...</i>

258
00:19:54.398 --> 00:19:56.782
<i>stubbornly sat there...</i>

259
00:19:57.371 --> 00:20:02.267
<i>and only looked in one direction
until the sun came down.</i>

260
00:20:03.326 --> 00:20:05.161
<i>It wasn't until much later</i>

00:20:52.183 --> 00:20:54.433

It's cold here, too.

268
00:20:54.433 --> 00:20:55.603
- Good work.
<i>- Oh, geez.</i>

269

<i>But it seems that she hasn't come yet.</i>

272

<i>I think I'll need to go there myself

<i>- Yes?</i>

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.735
"a baby rabbit..."

312
00:23:25.735 --> 00:23:30.987
"that wanted to run away."

313
00:23:31.716 --> 00:23:33.226
"Mom."

314
00:23:33.226 --> 00:23:38.001
"I'm going to run away."

315
00:23:40.767 --> 00:23:44.693
Miss Clara's nephews took her
to an assisted living facility last year

316
00:23:44.693 --> 00:23:45.745
after Christmastime.

317
00:23:45.745 --> 00:23:50.181
She definitely has started
to lose her mind a bit

318
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:53.331
but she's still strong enough
to hold and raise a newborn!

319
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:55.856
But her nephews want to sell her land.

320
00:23:55.856 --> 00:23:58.238
Geez, she doesn't have
any kids of her own

321
00:23:58.238 --> 00:24:01.613
so the entire place will be theirs
once the orphanage shuts down.

322
00:24:01.613 --> 00:24:04.803
Sometimes, she still seems
to have lucid moments.

323
00:24:04.803 --> 00:24:06.517
That'll be 9,500 won.

324
00:24:25.286 --> 00:24:27.583
You have to wash your hands
if you've been out.

325
00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:30.373
Yes, Ma'am.

326
00:24:34.568 --> 00:24:38.485
Soo Jin always used her fists first
instead of her words.

327
00:24:38.485 --> 00:24:43.413
She used to hit anyone she
didn't like, without discriminating.

328
00:24:43.413 --> 00:24:45.909
She'd throw things
if she got mad

329
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:47.828
and scream, like, "Ahh!"

330
00:24:47.828 --> 00:24:49.812
And she'd pull at her own hair.

331
00:24:50.725 --> 00:24:54.305
One time, she got so mad that

332
00:24:54.825 --> 00:24:57.065
she pooped out a huge turd,
right where I could see it.

333
00:24:57.065 --> 00:24:59.296
Right in the middle
of the kitchen. Ugh.

334
00:25:01.948 --> 00:25:04.508
She's lying.
It was a small poop.

335
00:25:05.603 --> 00:25:07.933
And she just wouldn't eat!

336
00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:10.401
That bothered me most of all.

337
00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:13.930
As if that tiny six year old
had no will to live.

338
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.087
Then, she suddenly stopped
being such a troublemaker.

339
00:25:21.423 --> 00:25:23.943
And she never caused
any trouble, ever again.

340
00:25:23.943 --> 00:25:25.682
Is that true?

341
00:25:26.371 --> 00:25:28.312
My mom wouldn't come to get me

342
00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:30.699
no matter how much trouble I caused.

343
00:25:48.123 --> 00:25:52.236
I don't want to become a mother.

344
00:25:53.113 --> 00:25:54.792
No matter what.

345
00:25:55.424 --> 00:25:58.020
I'll never become a mother.

346
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.527
<i>On December 17th,
in Mooryung of Gangwon Province</i>

347
00:26:06.527 --> 00:26:11.392
<i>Kim Hye Na was last seen at
the harbor before disappearing.</i>

348
00:26:11.392 --> 00:26:14.308

350
00:26:17.941 --> 00:26:21.085
<i>The mother of the child
who has yet to return</i>

351
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:25.457
<i>is full of worry, and hasn't been
able to leave the harbor.</i>

352
00:26:25.457 --> 00:26:27.871
<i>My daughter, who died
in such a pitiful way...</i>

353
00:26:28.776 --> 00:26:31.994
<i>is still shivering in the cold ocean.</i>

354
00:26:32.908 --> 00:26:35.792
<i>I want to get her corpse out of
the ocean as soon as possible...</i>

355
00:26:36.623 --> 00:26:39.077
<i>and have a proper funeral for her.</i>

356
00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:43.228
<i>Today marks the third day since this
elementary schooler has gone missing.</i>

357
00:26:43.228 --> 00:26:46.276
<i>The police have been conducting

358

<i>but they have yet to
find anything significant.</i>

359
00:26:48.853 --> 00:26:50.469
<i>Furthermore, on the internet</i>

360
00:26:50.469 --> 00:26:54.353
<i>a post about the child's mother being
aggressively investigated has circulated</i>

361
00:26:54.353 --> 00:26:56.374
<i>which has caused there to be
some criticism toward the police.</i>

362
00:26:56.374 --> 00:26:59.904
<i>According to the testimony of the
person who last saw Kim Hye Na</i>

363
00:26:59.904 --> 00:27:04.304
<i>the missing Ms. Kim was
wandering near this harbor by herself.</i>

364
00:27:04.304 --> 00:27:06.864
<i>The name of the missing child
is Kim Hye Na.</i>

365
00:27:06.864 --> 00:27:08.460
Yoon Bok.

366
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.065
<i>She is a girl who has just
turned nine this year.</i>

367
00:27:11.065 --> 00:27:14.745
<i>She was wearing a red jacket and
yellow sneakers when she disappeared...</i>

368
00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:26.033
Ms. Clara...

369
00:27:26.607 --> 00:27:29.456
said that she wanted to watch TV, so...

370
00:27:31.932 --> 00:27:35.023
If you have any desire to go back
to your mom, even now, just say the word.

371
00:27:35.023 --> 00:27:36.805
It's okay.

372
00:27:42.554 --> 00:27:44.884
When I was six years old...

373
00:27:45.379 --> 00:27:48.065
I was tied to a post
under the tree out front.

374
00:27:49.947 --> 00:27:52.789
They said that when they brought me
inside to get me washed up...

375
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:55.478
my entire body was covered in injuries.

376
00:27:56.995 --> 00:27:59.885
And yet, I still wanted to see my mom.

377
00:28:02.596 --> 00:28:04.528
So I understand.

378
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:06.921
If you want to go to
your mom, even now...

379
00:28:06.921 --> 00:28:08.725
My mom...

380
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.335
I only wanted to know...

381
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.469
how sad my mom would be
if I died, is all.

382
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:21.410
But my mom...

383
00:28:22.071 --> 00:28:24.225
isn't sad.

384
00:28:24.946 --> 00:28:27.413
She wishes that I were dead.

385
00:28:35.834 --> 00:28:38.736
Cut my hair so that I look like a boy.

386
00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:06.527
<i>Will I be able to protect this child?</i>

387
00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:10.564
<i>Will I be able to
become this child's mother?</i>

388
00:29:12.392 --> 00:29:15.163
I don't have a mother.

389
00:29:18.719 --> 00:29:21.500
So how could I become a mother?

390
00:29:29.524 --> 00:29:34.524
<font color="#fcc89b">[DramaFever Ver] tvN E03 Mother</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

391
00:29:43.523 --> 00:29:44.815
You...

392
00:29:45.433 --> 00:29:48.873
were a child who
didn't cry, Soo Jin.

393
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:53.575
If you'd cried just once,
it would've made you feel better.

394
00:29:53.575 --> 00:29:57.998
But it seemed to me that you'd decided
you wouldn't cry until your mom came.

395
00:29:58.777 --> 00:30:02.305
And it pained me so much to see that.

396
00:30:07.257 --> 00:30:09.187
It's okay.

397
00:30:10.486 --> 00:30:12.591
You'll feel better now.

398
00:30:15.199 --> 00:30:17.536
I don't know, Miss Clara.

399
00:30:20.113 --> 00:30:22.670
Am I doing the right thing?

400
00:30:23.892 --> 00:30:27.353
Why did I decide to
become that child's mother?

401
00:30:30.616 --> 00:30:32.834
When I sent you away
after you were adopted...

402
00:30:34.344 --> 00:30:37.857
I said the same prayer, right here.

403
00:30:39.459 --> 00:30:42.852
"I really don't know, God."

404
00:30:43.582 --> 00:30:46.248
"Is it the right thing to do
to send Soo Jin away?"

405
00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:49.930
"Did I do the right thing?"

406
00:30:56.981 --> 00:30:58.133
And now...

407
00:30:58.786 --> 00:31:01.594
I think I did the right thing back then.

408
00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:04.825
I'm so happy...

409
00:31:05.308 --> 00:31:08.017
to see that you've become a mother.

410
00:31:09.438 --> 00:31:12.895
I give you my blessing, Soo Jin.

411
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:18.577
Miss Clara.

412
00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:24.960
To tell you the truth, that child is...

413
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.255
Yeah.

414
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:33.005
Becoming a mother...

415
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.478
is similar to having contracted
a dangerous illness.

416
00:31:37.308 --> 00:31:41.055
<i>Not everyone can
overcome that illness.</i>

417
00:31:42.085 --> 00:31:45.505
<i>It's a very, very difficult thing to do.</i>

418
00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.709
<i>But...</i>

419
00:31:50.209 --> 00:31:52.470
you'll do just fine.

420
00:31:53.948 --> 00:31:57.043
I can tell, just from looking at
Yoon Bok for a short while.

421
00:31:58.017 --> 00:32:00.155
<i>She's so precious...</i>

422
00:32:01.726 --> 00:32:04.821
<i>and is so considerate of her mother.</i>

423
00:32:11.834 --> 00:32:14.141
<i>Listen carefully, Soo Jin.</i>

424
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.738
<i>Soon, some people
will be coming here.</i>

425
00:32:18.795 --> 00:32:21.528
<i>They will come into my house
with their shoes on</i>

426
00:32:21.528 --> 00:32:25.708
<i>and will probably
kick my things around.</i>

427
00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:40.815
<i>These are just like the
umbilical cords of my babies.</i>

<i>[Nam Soo Jin]</i>

429
00:32:54.035 --> 00:32:56.767
<i>I wanted to give this back to you...</i>

430
00:32:56.767 --> 00:32:59.218
<i>when you returned here as an adult.</i>

431
00:33:20.478 --> 00:33:24.419
<i>It's a sad thing to slowly lose
your mind as you get old.</i>

432
00:33:25.058 --> 00:33:26.911
<i>But it can't be helped.</i>

433
00:33:26.911 --> 00:33:30.075
<i>This is all a part of God's will, too.</i>

434
00:33:31.212 --> 00:33:36.344
<i>I have to slowly make my
preparations to leave now</i>

435
00:33:36.344 --> 00:33:39.066
<i>while I still have
a shred of my sanity left.</i>

436
00:34:06.752 --> 00:34:08.506
<i>Goodbye...</i>

437
00:34:10.576 --> 00:34:12.444
<i>my children.</i>

438
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.176
<i>Goodbye.</i>

439
00:34:49.835 --> 00:34:51.511
<i>You saw Hye Na?</i>

440
00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:52.917
<i>I think I saw her.</i>

441
00:34:52.917 --> 00:34:55.046
<i>I hate myself so much.</i>

442
00:34:55.046 --> 00:34:56.756
Mom!

443
00:34:56.756 --> 00:34:58.975
Because it feels like
she died because of me.

444
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.926
How many times have you
looked at this, already?

445
00:35:13.926 --> 00:35:15.102
Is there something there?

446
00:35:15.102 --> 00:35:16.855
I just don't get it.

447
00:35:16.855 --> 00:35:21.040
A small child like this walked for
over an hour for no special reason

448
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.384
and is walking as if she has
a GPS inside of her head.

449
00:35:23.384 --> 00:35:24.763
Does this make any sense to you?

450
00:35:25.897 --> 00:35:28.091
Seeing her stop and stare
at the sky like that

451
00:35:28.091 --> 00:35:30.024
it almost seems as if she saw
a UFO or a ghost.

452
00:35:30.024 --> 00:35:31.991
And look, she's even
waving her hand at them.

453
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:33.978
Was it a plane?

454
00:35:33.978 --> 00:35:35.308
They're birds.

455
00:35:36.629 --> 00:35:38.868
See? You can see them
flying, over here.

456
00:35:38.868 --> 00:35:40.283
They're migratory birds.

457
00:35:50.261 --> 00:35:51.719
<i>[Fisherman from Baek Island Port]</i>

458
00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:55.442
<i>I told her to hurry and go home
since the winds were really strong</i>

459
00:35:55.442 --> 00:35:59.676
<i>but she flapped her arms like a bird,
and said, "Okay," I think.</i>

460
00:36:04.808 --> 00:36:06.361
Excuse me.

461
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.980
- That child...
- Yes?

462
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.513
waved her hand at the birds

463
00:36:10.513 --> 00:36:12.888
and said, "Hey, take me away, too!"

464
00:36:12.888 --> 00:36:14.274
Yeah, that's right.

465
00:36:14.274 --> 00:36:16.406
"Take me away, too!"

466
00:36:16.922 --> 00:36:17.922
Yeah.

467
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.426
<i>So, to sum things up</i>

468
00:36:26.426 --> 00:36:29.174
the mother has no interest in her child

469
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:32.513
and the man her mother
lives with is a scary person.

470
00:36:33.171 --> 00:36:36.277
And every day, the child didn't want to
go home, so she wandered around

471
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:39.169
<i>and followed the birds
for over one hour.</i>

472
00:36:39.169 --> 00:36:41.428
<i>And this is the end of that road.</i>

473
00:36:42.544 --> 00:36:45.085
<i>She wanted to follow the birds</i>

474
00:36:45.085 --> 00:36:46.618
<i>and ended up falling into the water.</i>

475
00:36:48.634 --> 00:36:50.131
That's what happened.

476
00:36:56.466 --> 00:36:58.585
I think it makes sense.

477
00:36:59.567 --> 00:37:01.667
Is there still something that seems off?

478
00:37:05.877 --> 00:37:10.062
Her homeroom teacher
gave birth to twins yesterday

479
00:37:10.062 --> 00:37:13.279
so it'll be a while until
you'll be able to meet with her.

480
00:37:13.279 --> 00:37:15.268
Oh, really?

481
00:37:15.268 --> 00:37:18.406
Is her substitute homeroom
teacher around, then?

482
00:37:18.406 --> 00:37:19.696
Why?

483
00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:20.997
Um, well...

484
00:37:20.997 --> 00:37:24.181
I just want to know more about
Hye Na's school life.

485
00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:25.471
Or maybe about her social life.

486
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:27.562
Oh, she's not here now.

487
00:37:27.562 --> 00:37:31.779
The teacher who was here briefly
went to go study abroad.

488
00:37:31.779 --> 00:37:33.558
Before this incident happened.

489
00:37:34.174 --> 00:37:36.306
She was a researcher, you see.

490
00:37:36.306 --> 00:37:37.861
She studied birds.

491
00:37:40.453 --> 00:37:41.797
Birds?

492
00:37:42.938 --> 00:37:44.140
Airplane.

493
00:37:45.351 --> 00:37:46.753
Seagull.

494
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.976
Train.

495
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:53.168
We have to clean up all the toys
in the front yard and pack our things.

496
00:37:53.168 --> 00:37:56.407
Mom, Mom! "Train."

497
00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.313
So that we can leave at any time.

498
00:37:58.313 --> 00:37:59.438
Circuit breaker.

499
00:37:59.438 --> 00:38:00.668
Giraffe.
("Gi-rin" in Korean)

500
00:38:00.668 --> 00:38:02.528
A word that starts with
the "rin" sound?

501
00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:06.570
Um...

502
00:38:21.793 --> 00:38:23.979
Where are we going?

503
00:38:25.198 --> 00:38:26.932
I'm thinking about it.

504
00:38:30.947 --> 00:38:33.943
Miss Clara is coming
with us too, right?

505
00:38:35.724 --> 00:38:37.537
We're on the run right now.

506
00:38:37.537 --> 00:38:40.006
Miss Clara said that
she's on the run, too.

507
00:38:40.006 --> 00:38:42.106
She needs to be taken care of by someone.

508
00:38:42.106 --> 00:38:43.122
Like, at a hospital.

509
00:38:43.122 --> 00:38:45.639
I can take care of her.

510
00:38:46.255 --> 00:38:50.014
Miss Clara said that she
doesn't want to go to the hospital.

511
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:53.092
She said that she wants
to live with her children.

512
00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:09.438
No.

513
00:39:15.137 --> 00:39:17.159
<i>Miss Clara...</i>

514
00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:19.794
<i>is quite an important
person to me, your mother.</i>

515
00:39:19.794 --> 00:39:23.318
She was by my side during
the toughest part of my life...

516
00:39:24.235 --> 00:39:27.090
and she's still the first person
I think of during tough times.

517
00:39:28.698 --> 00:39:31.409
But the most important thing to me

518
00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:34.010
is escaping safely, with you.

519
00:39:34.814 --> 00:39:37.573
And Miss Clara wants that, too.

520
00:39:37.573 --> 00:39:40.552
For me to watch over you well,
with all my strength.

521
00:39:40.552 --> 00:39:43.150
She raised me to be like that.

522
00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:46.082
But, Mom...

523
00:39:46.746 --> 00:39:49.733
I can't do that.

524
00:39:51.506 --> 00:39:54.974
I can't tell Miss Clara...

525
00:39:55.653 --> 00:39:58.276
to take care, and just leave her here.

526
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:02.680
How will she be able to eat
and sleep by herself?

527
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:07.508
What if she thinks that
we cast her aside?

528
00:40:10.063 --> 00:40:14.903
<i>Has Ms. Kang Soo Jin ever told you
about the students she taught?</i>

529
00:40:15.965 --> 00:40:19.133
She doesn't really like kids, so...

530
00:40:19.133 --> 00:40:23.307
Did she have personal exchanges with
students who liked birds, maybe?

531
00:40:23.307 --> 00:40:26.269
It seemed to me that the kids
didn't like Soo Jin, either.

532
00:40:26.269 --> 00:40:28.689
Why? Do you have any suspicions?

533
00:40:29.423 --> 00:40:34.298
No, I just wanted to ask
Ms. Kang something, is all.

534
00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:39.015
For example, "Could an elementary
schooler really walk 2.8 kilometers"

535
00:40:39.015 --> 00:40:44.561
"when it was negative 5 degrees Celsius
outside, just because she liked birds?"

536
00:40:48.255 --> 00:40:50.407
Well, when I was a kid

537
00:40:50.407 --> 00:40:54.053
I walked over five kilometers
way out in the countryside

538
00:40:54.053 --> 00:40:56.860
just to catch a glimpse of a
new robot that came out.

539
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.909
Haven't you ever done
anything like that, Detective?

540
00:41:01.651 --> 00:41:03.977
Yes, well, all right.

541
00:41:03.977 --> 00:41:07.028
Please give me a call
if you get in touch with her.

542
00:41:07.028 --> 00:41:08.485
Yes, I will.

543
00:41:08.485 --> 00:41:09.677
Thank you.

544
00:41:09.677 --> 00:41:10.871
Goodbye.

545
00:41:15.952 --> 00:41:17.354
<i>Kang Soo Jin.</i>

546
00:41:17.901 --> 00:41:19.650
<i>The rings that you retrieved...</i>

547
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.436
<i>were 14, in total.</i>

548
00:41:21.436 --> 00:41:24.115
<i>You said you'd leave when
you retrieved 20 of them.</i>

549
00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:25.869
<i>I know that you're not the type of person</i>

550
00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:29.380
<i>who would have left before collecting 20,
unless something extraordinary happened.</i>

551
00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.657
<i>And I know that this assignment that
you've left for me is no ordinary task.</i>

552
00:41:34.481 --> 00:41:37.477
<i>Today, a detective came
asking about you.</i>

553
00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:39.986
<i>Even though I don't know where you are.</i>

554
00:41:45.977 --> 00:41:48.793
<i>You remember the GPS tracker
that I showed you last time, right?</i>

555
00:41:49.684 --> 00:41:51.144
<i>I stuck it onto the truck</i>

556
00:41:51.144 --> 00:41:54.387
<i>belonging to the man
you told me about, just in case.</i>

557
00:41:55.137 --> 00:41:57.523
<i>The battery will work for two years.</i>

558
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.151
I knew you'd be here, Aunt.

559
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:48.448
I'm sorry.

560
00:42:48.448 --> 00:42:49.918
I won't do it again.

561
00:42:50.599 --> 00:42:52.532
I want to live here.

562
00:42:52.532 --> 00:42:53.918
Aunt.

563
00:42:54.494 --> 00:42:57.079
This house isn't yours anymore.

564
00:42:57.079 --> 00:43:00.025
I'll take you somewhere
much more comfortable.

565
00:43:00.025 --> 00:43:03.102
I'm the one who planted
all the trees here

566
00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:05.900
and I painted all those, over there.

567
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:09.447
And I raised all my kids here,
so why isn't this my house?

568
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:12.631
Aunt.

569
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:16.115
You don't have to suffer anymore.

570
00:43:16.115 --> 00:43:20.133
We'll make this place into
a beautiful vacation home

571
00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:21.903
so don't worry.

572
00:43:25.097 --> 00:43:26.517
What's the matter?

573
00:43:26.517 --> 00:43:28.072
Why are you acting as if
what I'm doing is wrong?

574
00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:29.113
Oh, whatever!

575
00:43:29.113 --> 00:43:31.967
She can't even recognize people
properly anymore.

576
00:43:31.967 --> 00:43:34.352
Take whatever you can take.

577
00:43:34.352 --> 00:43:35.981
- All right.
- Okay.

578
00:43:35.981 --> 00:43:37.791
What do we do?

579
00:43:42.251 --> 00:43:44.648
Take this bag, Yoon Bok.

580
00:43:44.648 --> 00:43:46.832
And from this point on,
don't say a word, okay?

581
00:43:46.832 --> 00:43:49.217
Only listen to what I say,
and look only at me.

582
00:43:49.217 --> 00:43:50.334
Okay?

583
00:43:57.075 --> 00:43:58.691
Go in here.

584
00:44:24.012 --> 00:44:25.746
Joon Young.

585
00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:26.816
What?

586
00:44:26.816 --> 00:44:28.639
Where did my kids go?

587
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:30.889
What are you saying?

588
00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:33.035
All the kids grew up
and went their separate ways!

589
00:44:33.035 --> 00:44:35.296
It feels like only yesterday
when I changed your diapers

590
00:44:35.296 --> 00:44:37.957
and fed you food.

591
00:44:37.957 --> 00:44:40.358
It's not like you changed
my diaper that much.

592
00:44:45.044 --> 00:44:48.829
I'll walk with my own two feet,
so tell these people to let go of me.

593
00:44:56.678 --> 00:44:58.390
I have a few things.

594
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.852
I'm going to look around
one last time.

595
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.947
I haven't taken my things out yet.

596
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:28.979
Yoon Bok.

597
00:45:30.104 --> 00:45:31.568
<i>You...</i>

598
00:45:32.017 --> 00:45:34.941
<i>are my last child.</i>

599
00:45:35.675 --> 00:45:37.675
So please...

600
00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:39.592
take good care of your mother.

601
00:45:48.332 --> 00:45:52.130
<i>Your mother was the most
fearful among my children.</i>

602
00:45:53.093 --> 00:45:56.825
<i>She'd always quake in fear
because she couldn't trust anyone.</i>

603
00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:00.896
But you're with her,
which makes me feel relieved.

604
00:46:00.896 --> 00:46:02.113
Miss...

605
00:46:09.635 --> 00:46:11.052
Soo Jin.

606
00:46:11.988 --> 00:46:15.572
Thank you for
becoming a mother.

607
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.910
I was so happy to have been able
to hold your child.

608
00:46:23.885 --> 00:46:25.631
I'd like it...

609
00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.707
if God would allow me to
remember this, at the very least.

610
00:46:31.784 --> 00:46:35.401
The fact that my Soo Jin
became a mother.

614
00:48:26.849 --> 00:48:27.849
Huh?

615
00:48:28.586 --> 00:48:30.910
A word that begins
with the "rin" sound.

616
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.765
It was my turn, after
she said giraffe (gi-rin).

617
00:48:34.765 --> 00:48:37.282
A word that starts with "rin."

628
00:49:38.884 --> 00:49:40.143

<i>[Baek Island Apartment Suite 503]</i>

631
00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:50.724
Why did you send a package
to Ms. Ye Eun?

632
00:49:50.724 --> 00:49:52.802
There's a 1 in 10,000 chance

633
00:49:52.802 --> 00:49:55.818
that things could go wrong...

634
00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.503
so I'm asking Ms. Ye Eun
to help us if they do.

635
00:49:59.503 --> 00:50:03.230
That's 1 in 10,000, so...

636
00:50:04.782 --> 00:50:08.829
chances are we'll be all right,
9,999 to 1, right?

637
00:50:11.782 --> 00:50:13.070
Yeah.

638
00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:17.364
There's a 9,999 out of 10,000 chance
that we'll be fine.

639
00:50:17.364 --> 00:50:18.835
That's a relief.

640
00:50:18.835 --> 00:50:20.085
Let's go.

641
00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:38.483
I could have gone to see
a different doctor

642
00:50:38.483 --> 00:50:40.856
and asked them to read over
the results of my mom's CT scan.

643
00:50:40.856 --> 00:50:44.581
And said I wanted a second opinion
before making any important decisions.

644
00:50:45.923 --> 00:50:49.704
But I thought about it again,
and I'm my mom's biological daughter.

645
00:50:49.704 --> 00:50:51.704
So I had no reason to do that.

646
00:50:52.809 --> 00:50:54.648
Explain this to me.

647
00:50:54.648 --> 00:50:56.413
What's going on?

648
00:50:56.903 --> 00:50:58.420
Um...

649
00:50:59.003 --> 00:51:03.108
it seems that Ms. Cha
didn't tell you herself.

650
00:51:03.751 --> 00:51:05.675
It has spread, so...

651
00:51:05.675 --> 00:51:06.909
Wait.

652
00:51:07.519 --> 00:51:09.077
It spread?

653
00:51:10.675 --> 00:51:13.099
Has she relapsed?

654
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.940
Um...

655
00:51:17.586 --> 00:51:18.586
well...

656
00:51:36.237 --> 00:51:37.463
Mom.

657
00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:42.143
How did you meet the mother
who'd raised you?

658
00:51:49.074 --> 00:51:51.903
One night, I lay down to sleep...

659
00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:54.715
when a new child came.

660
00:51:55.824 --> 00:51:59.346
<i>That child cried all night
and couldn't sleep...</i>

661
00:52:02.956 --> 00:52:05.893
Are you scared?
Want me to lie with you?

662
00:52:10.436 --> 00:52:12.574
Everyone cries in the beginning.

663
00:52:12.574 --> 00:52:14.577
Because they want to see their moms.

664
00:52:17.347 --> 00:52:20.835
Soo Jung's mom is really sick.

665
00:52:21.449 --> 00:52:23.634
And as for Hyun Jung's mom...

666
00:52:25.115 --> 00:52:27.067
she ran away.

667
00:52:27.067 --> 00:52:30.596
Hyun Ji's mom died while giving
birth to her younger sibling.

668
00:52:30.596 --> 00:52:33.898
Ji Young lost her mom.

669
00:52:33.898 --> 00:52:37.844
Mi Young's mom went crazy
and got sent to a mental hospital.

670
00:52:37.844 --> 00:52:40.123
And as for Young Seon's mom...

671
00:52:41.172 --> 00:52:43.509
her dad killed her mom.

672
00:52:44.851 --> 00:52:48.222
My mom was scared that I'd follow her

673
00:52:48.222 --> 00:52:53.940
so she tied me up under the
tree over there and ran away.

674
00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.271
How did you get here?

675
00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.175
<i>But, the next day...</i>

676
00:53:00.817 --> 00:53:03.612
that child was actually
quite a large adult.

677
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.192
And she was quite beautiful, too.

678
00:53:07.634 --> 00:53:09.454
How big was she?

679
00:53:13.927 --> 00:53:15.378
Here, over here.

680
00:53:19.682 --> 00:53:20.840
You're good!

681
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.074
<i>She was around 32 or
33 years old, I think?</i>

682
00:53:23.612 --> 00:53:26.581
<i>She was fully grown, and had
come to volunteer there.</i>

683
00:53:39.809 --> 00:53:42.673
<i>I think she slept there for
about a week before leaving.</i>

684
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.231
<i>She slept quite soundly.</i>

685
00:53:49.231 --> 00:53:50.686
<i>And had a big appetite.</i>

686
00:53:51.675 --> 00:53:54.920
<i>And then, she came back,
saying she'd adopt me.</i>

687
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.548
No! I won't go!

688
00:53:57.548 --> 00:53:59.623
Please don't send me away, Miss Clara!

689
00:54:00.701 --> 00:54:03.286
I'll eat all my meals and be obedient!

690
00:54:03.286 --> 00:54:04.413
Please?

691
00:54:09.327 --> 00:54:11.373
<i>Why are you doing this to me, Mom?</i>

692
00:54:11.876 --> 00:54:13.467
What did I do wrong?

693
00:54:13.467 --> 00:54:15.838
When it came to walking,
smiling, talking

694
00:54:15.838 --> 00:54:18.978
and even choosing a man,
I obeyed you!

695
00:54:18.978 --> 00:54:20.132
And yet...

696
00:54:20.132 --> 00:54:22.601
why is it that you only
care about Big Sis?

697
00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:25.945
Were you planning to tell only
Big Sis that you're dying?

698
00:54:25.945 --> 00:54:27.012
Yi Jin.

699
00:54:27.012 --> 00:54:29.490
- Don't get worked up, and...
- Do you think...

700
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.773
Big Sis will come running back
if you tell her that you have cancer?

701
00:54:32.773 --> 00:54:36.077
The person who will take care of you
when you get old and sickly is me!

702
00:54:36.077 --> 00:54:38.518
The person who will be sad is me!

703
00:54:38.518 --> 00:54:40.324
I know, my daughter.

704
00:54:52.099 --> 00:54:54.297
I know that you'll be sad.

705
00:54:57.668 --> 00:54:59.797
That's why I couldn't tell you.

706
00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:01.360
So...

707
00:55:02.413 --> 00:55:03.947
are you going to die?

708
00:55:05.518 --> 00:55:07.652
Even when it comes to dying...

709
00:55:07.652 --> 00:55:10.346
I was presented
with a lot of options.

710
00:55:10.942 --> 00:55:13.659
I could die slowly and painfully

711
00:55:13.659 --> 00:55:15.762
while wasting money.

712
00:55:17.771 --> 00:55:20.788
Or I could do whatever
I wanted for six months or so

713
00:55:20.788 --> 00:55:22.715
and die suddenly.

714
00:55:22.715 --> 00:55:25.126
What do you mean, there are
options when it comes to dying?

715
00:55:25.126 --> 00:55:27.905
You have to hang in there no matter
what and survive until the end!

716
00:55:27.905 --> 00:55:31.237
You have me, my husband,
and my kids, too.

717
00:55:34.028 --> 00:55:36.204
I'm going to think about it
for a long time...

718
00:55:36.204 --> 00:55:38.298
and then do as I wish.

719
00:55:39.413 --> 00:55:42.382
The only one who didn't yield to
your will was Big Sis, wasn't she?

720
00:56:08.286 --> 00:56:09.402
Let's go.

721
00:56:28.054 --> 00:56:30.601
Where are we going tomorrow?

722
00:56:34.777 --> 00:56:37.592
The place I want to go to
the least in the whole world.

723

Look at this!

727
00:57:17.135 --> 00:57:19.347
What kind of bird is this?

728
00:57:19.983 --> 00:57:21.565
It's a Gouldian finch.

729

Wait, Ms. Song!

Oh, hello!

<i>Oh, let's try drawing a
pretty princess's house!</i>

742
00:58:17.646 --> 00:58:20.402
Get your hair cut, and play
at the playground over there.

743
00:58:20.402 --> 00:58:21.898
I'll be there later to pick you up.

744
00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:22.898
All right.

745
00:58:23.318 --> 00:58:26.210
Why would you have her play at a

00:58:26.773 --> 00:58:27.836
Pardon?

747
00:58:27.836 --> 00:58:30.807
It would be better for her to
watch TV here and eat some snacks.

748
00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:32.672
What kinds of snacks do you have?

749
00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:42.099
Can't I stay here, Mom?

750
00:58:44.483 --> 00:58:46.755
I'm afraid that'll be
too much of a burden.

751
00:58:57.023 --> 00:58:58.923
I'll entrust her to you, then.

00:58:59.427 --> 00:59:01.213
I won't be back too late.

753
00:59:01.213 --> 00:59:02.605
