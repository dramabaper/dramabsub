00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.120
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.160
I fell asleep. Gosh, I totally dozed off.

3
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
Nothing happened while I fell asleep, right?

4
00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.999
I had a dream.

5
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.870
It was a really upsetting dream.

6
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.040
Keep sleeping.

7
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.139
Should I?

8
00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:46.819
Is today...

9
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.120
our...

10
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.620
First day of going out.

11
00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.129
Gosh, you're cute.

12
00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.400
You're cuter.

13
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.740
(Rest Stop)

14
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.630
Here's your Americano.

15
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.269
Thank you.

16
00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.250
Are you up?

17
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.910
- Yes. - Here.

18
00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.679
Thank you.

19
00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.190
Let's go.

20
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.269
Should I drive around your neighborhood one more time?

21
00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.200
It's already our fifth time.

22
00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:45.899
You should go home now.

23
00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:47.510
When are you going to come?

24
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.109
I'll call you after I take a nap.

25
00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:53.410
What a pity.

26
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.149
Do you want to start working at my place again?

27
00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.880
Hurry up and go home.

28
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.389
- Bye. - See you.

29
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.450
Okay.

30
00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.530
Bye.

31
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.829
- Bye. - Okay.

32
00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:11.959
See you.

33
00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:19.369
Bye.

34
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.570
- Go on. - You go first.

35
00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.980
- No, you go first. - You go first.

36
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.139
Hurry up. I'll go after I see you go inside.

37
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.280
Okay.

38
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.380
- Go on. - Bye. I'm really going this time.

39
00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.609
Aunt Ji A.

40
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.109
Where were you last night?

41
00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.380
Mount Hwangmae.

42
00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.119
Mount Hwangmae? Why did you go there?

43
00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.389
Aunt Ji A, wasn't it cold?

44
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.889
It wasn't cold at all. It was really warm.

45
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.530
Hey, go hit your aunt.

46
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.930
Come over here.

47
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.099
You cutie pie.

48
00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:50.729
Chairman Hwang...

49
00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.630
is waiting for you.

50
00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.399
Where is my Aji 3?

51
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.589
Tomorrow, with our contract,

52
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.659
we can send Aji 3, really.

53
00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.430
You got lucky.

54
00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.829
You broke a promise to me.

55
00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.430
And your son made me wait.

56
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.070
People don't break promises to me.

57
00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.269
And they don't make me wait.

58
00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:34.740
Because I don't forgive.

59
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.479
And I never forget.

60
00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.479
You know me, Hwang Do Won.

61
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.149
Mr... Mr. Martin.

62
00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.659
Bring me the Aji 3.

63
00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.529
We will give it a thorough examination first.

64
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.329
Won't we, Doctor Casey?

65
00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.800
Mr. Jang.

66
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.909
It's been a while.

67
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.779
Doctor Hong.

68
00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:20.950
Just like you,

69
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.289
I also revered Chairman Park.

70
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.120
He was passionate about robots enough to...

71
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.159
create a secret team in his company.

72
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.700
Tomorrow, when the deal between...

73
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.370
KM Financial and Martin is finalized,

74
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.800
the chairman's dream...

75
00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.200
will vanish forever.

76
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.639
Please help us.

77
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:51.680
Chairman Park's death was no accident.

78
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.690
Take this money...

79
00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:05.060
and go abroad.

80
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.670
You were Chairman Park's driver for about five years.

81
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.800
Yes.

82
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.039
You...

83
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.539
did not see anything.

84
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.579
Me, Martin,

85
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.279
or Santa Maria.

86
00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:27.389
Chairman Park died in a hit-and-run accident...

87
00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.589
and you almost died yourself.

88
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.089
That's all you need to remember.

89
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.289
Chairman Park's accident.

90
00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.130
Did you set it up?

91
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.000
Remember this.

92
00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:46.740
You know nothing.

93
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.279
That's the only way to guarantee you and your family's safety.

94
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.219
Did Chairman Hwang Do Won really say that?

95
00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:00.750
Did you record it?

96
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.620
The second I give you the recording, I might die.

97
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.019
I'm being chased right now. Give me time to think.

98
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.000
Did you find Jang Doo Sam?

99
00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:16.370
Why? Did you think I didn't know?

100
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:18.539
I'll ask you point blank.

101
00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.440
Chairman Park Sung Jin.

102
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.870
Did my dad kill him?

103
00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.139
No.

104
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.979
Then who did?

105
00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.950
When the deal's signed tomorrow, Director Kim will be fired.

106
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.820
No, that's not what I asked you.

107
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.589
If Min Kyu finds Jang Doo Sam,

108
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.759
what will happen next?

109
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.930
(Jo Jin Bae)

110
00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.099
I'm sorry, sir.

111
00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:50.670
Do you think you can survive...

112
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.670
in this company if you work like that?

113
00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:55.810
I'm really sorry.

114
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.979
Why did you live your life like that, Min Kyu?

115
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.520
(Jo Jin Bae)

116
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.829
Is this Mr. Jo Jin Bae?

117
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.589
Yes, sir.

118
00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:21.300
Have you eaten?

119
00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:22.700
What?

120
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.869
Never mind.

121
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.239
Where are you right now?

122
00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:31.410
On the way to court, to file the lawsuit.

123
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.680
The... The lawsuit?

124
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.619
Yes, against the Santa Maria Team and my sister Ji A.

125
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.089
Oh, yes, that, cancel that.

126
00:09:43.089 --> 00:09:44.759
I won't sue them.

127
00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:48.390
It's best that you go ahead so you don't regret later on.

128
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.259
I won't, I won't sue them.

129
00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:52.729
I understand.

130
00:09:52.729 --> 00:09:55.700
Who will you not sue, then?

131
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.969
Is it the Santa Maria Team or my sister?

132
00:09:58.969 --> 00:10:01.910
Well... For now,

133
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.209
I can't be bothered, so drop the charges on both.

134
00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:06.609
Yes, sir.

135
00:10:06.609 --> 00:10:08.479
I'll keep the paperwork.

136
00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:10.879
Tell me if you change your mind.

137
00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:14.119
I won't change my mind. Just tear everything up.

138
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.890
Come to my place right now.

139
00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:19.020
No.

140
00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.430
Would you mind coming over, please?

141
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.430
Of course, sir.

142
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.629
I had something to report to you anyway.

143
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.070
Okay.

144
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.780
Gosh, what was that?

145
00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:41.849
I've never felt that feeling before.

146
00:10:45.849 --> 00:10:49.520
I don't think the term "full recovery" applies to you.

147
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.259
Depending on how you feel,

148
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:54.629
the symptoms can always disappear or come back.

149
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:57.129
It might be easier if you consider it a friend...

150
00:10:57.129 --> 00:10:58.700
you're stuck with forever.

151
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.129
My illness is my friend?

152
00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:04.239
One should learn to soothe their chronic illnesses.

153
00:11:04.239 --> 00:11:07.300
The problem is that your medicines won't work as effectively.

154
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.469
You should be careful until a new one is developed.

155
00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:11.709
I will.

156
00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:13.579
If you reconciled with Ji A,

157
00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:15.509
did you reconcile with the Santa Maria Team?

158
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:16.650
That's...

159
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.180
a different issue, I think.

160
00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:23.050
You're the one who spent time with them.

161
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.290
What you feel would be the truth.

162
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.690
However, the people I saw...

163
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.430
were truly worried about you.

164
00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:39.570
Please sit...

165
00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:42.040
Mr. Jo.

166
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.239
No. It's fine, sir.

167
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.410
You don't have to stand so far away from me.

168
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.820
As long as we just don't touch.

169
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:55.349
It's fine, sir. I prefer it this way.

170
00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:58.320
Okay, you prefer it that way.

171
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.690
I don't.

172
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.440
That's not what I asked you to do.

173
00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:18.040
Just sit in the chair.

174
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.009
- Please. - Okay.

175
00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:21.609
Then I'll sit.

176
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.420
(Vegetable juice)

177
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.379
You did...

178
00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:54.180
nothing wrong at all.

179
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.680
I will not accept your resignation.

180
00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.979
You did make mistakes,

181
00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:01.119
but I understand why you made them.

182
00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:05.219
So don't act like you're guilty when you're around me.

183
00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:06.790
That's exactly what...

184
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.859
makes me feel uncomfortable.

185
00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:12.800
I...

186
00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:16.300
trust and...

187
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.700
believe you.

188
00:13:19.239 --> 00:13:20.570
Don't trust me.

189
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.770
As a civil-rights lawyer,

190
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.040
I thought I could never tell even the smallest of lies.

191
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.079
This job proved me wrong.

192
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.979
Everyone's capable of changing.

193
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.650
But still,

194
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.229
I will trust you and deal with the consequences.

195
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.759
But my sister...

196
00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:45.200
I like your sister.

197
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.670
I like her very much. Does that fact...

198
00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.839
pose as a problem between...

199
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:53.339
our relationship?

200
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.239
- Not right now. - Then...

201
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.239
please proceed.

202
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.349
Martin flew into Korea today.

203
00:14:01.349 --> 00:14:03.650
And the Santa Maria Team?

204
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.979
Once the deal's done, they will...

205
00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:08.719
lose all their research on Aji 3.

206
00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:12.320
We located Jang Doo Sam,

207
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.690
but he refused to cooperate.

208
00:14:18.714 --> 00:14:23.714
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E28 I'm Not a Robot "Just a Product Owned by a Man"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

209
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.339
We'll be there soon.

210
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.079
We're still charging her. We'll start packing when you arrive.

211
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.410
Let's try to keep this quiet.

212
00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.619
Aji 3.

213
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.190
What's the cow that we can't eat?

214
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.729
I don't know.

215
00:14:53.229 --> 00:14:55.800
Aji 3, you're going to a nice place.

216
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.640
You'll meet a new master and be happy.

217
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.469
Don't worry.

218
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.150
(Sadness)

219
00:15:11.719 --> 00:15:15.650
Today, you are telling a lie to make me happy.

220
00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:25.599
Once the deal's done, they will...

221
00:15:25.599 --> 00:15:28.200
lose all their research on Aji 3.

222
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.739
(Written Statement)

223
00:15:34.969 --> 00:15:37.209
(Statement)

224
00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:38.209
Min Kyu,

225
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.979
Ji A really didn't know anything.

226
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.950
It was all our... No, it was my fault.

227
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.550
Ji A wanted to back out, and I convinced her not to.

228
00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:52.089
It was me.

229
00:15:52.859 --> 00:15:53.890
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.790
Master.

231
00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:59.329
I think you should come out here.

232
00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:02.770
Something's going on in the outhouse.

233
00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:13.040
Wow. So interesting.

234
00:16:13.979 --> 00:16:15.249
Beautiful girl.

235
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.119
I'll take you apart and all the technology you're made of.

236
00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:24.420
Team Santa Maria. Thank you.

237
00:16:25.989 --> 00:16:28.829
Taking apart Aji 3 before signing the contract...

238
00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:30.030
is against our terms.

239
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.129
Calm down.

240
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.530
Today's our first day of testing.

241
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.540
I'll take her apart after arriving in England.

242
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.910
I can take apart her face by myself.

243
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.579
I want to see the motor assembly behind her skin.

244
00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:49.209
Don't even think about touching her before signing the contract.

245
00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:01.030
Sorry. We didn't mean to come here.

246
00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:03.359
We had to to charge Aji 3.

247
00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:06.430
We'll have our things moved soon.

248
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:08.370
Where's Aji 3?

249
00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.569
Where is she?

250
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.440
They took her.

251
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:18.509
We meant to send her anyway.

252
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.850
How could you let her go that easily?

253
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.219
Is that what Aji 3 meant to your team?

254
00:17:25.219 --> 00:17:28.249
It wasn't easy. It was beyond our control, it was...

255
00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:32.059
the only way.

256
00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:35.289
You asked your ex to pretend to be a robot for 50 million...

257
00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:38.299
and conned me to think it was a test.

258
00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:40.029
Where did those guts go?

259
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.299
You should've done everything you could.

260
00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:45.039
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.370
Don't apologize to me, apologize to them.

262
00:17:48.769 --> 00:17:50.039
Sorry, brother.

263
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.640
We all agreed to it.

264
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.110
I'm sorry, brother.

265
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.180
I'm really sorry.

266
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.279
Sorry. I really am.

267
00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:03.690
Aren't any of you angry?

268
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:06.920
If you want to be angry at me, go ahead.

269
00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:08.430
You know why...

270
00:18:09.729 --> 00:18:10.930
we sent her away.

271
00:18:11.229 --> 00:18:13.860
Do you want to brag that you let her go for me?

272
00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:16.529
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

273
00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:17.670
Kim Min Kyu.

274
00:18:19.969 --> 00:18:21.110
Do you know...

275
00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:24.840
what it's like to have the media hound you?

276
00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.110
I know,

277
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.680
we know...

278
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.410
because we've been through it.

279
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.519
It means being branded forever.

280
00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:36.690
However loud you speak the truth, no one will listen.

281
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.489
The rest of your life...

282
00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:42.090
will end up the way the media portrays you.

283
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.430
We...

284
00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:46.729
don't want to see you...

285
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.299
end up like that.

286
00:19:00.509 --> 00:19:01.779
Did I ask for this?

287
00:19:17.229 --> 00:19:18.299
How is it?

288
00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:20.400
It's amazing.

289
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.999
It's not only the technology that surprises me.

290
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.999
The learning ability is out of this world.

291
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.140
The client will love this.

292
00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:31.110
Will I be upgraded?

293
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.880
Yes. You'll be a military robot.

294
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.809
The world's most dangerous weapon.

295
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.950
Am I not supposed to live with humans?

296
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.719
You're just a product owned by a man.

297
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.360
This man.

298
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.360
You do not exist as a living creature.

299
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:54.430
If you checked enough,

300
00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:58.440
I will keep Aji 3 before the contract tomorrow.

301
00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.940
To avoid being tracked,

302
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.870
let me take out the GPS before you take it.

303
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.920
(Jo Ji A)

304
00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:18.120
(Kim Min Kyu)

305
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.029
Hi.

306
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.900
Did you sleep?

307
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.670
Yes, I just woke.

308
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.640
You?

309
00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:38.180
I had a lot to do.

310
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.749
Why are you laughing?

311
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.719
You're really President Jo.

312
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.450
Are you pleased?

313
00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:51.090
Yes, really pleased.

314
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.890
No wonder talking to you felt so familiar.

315
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:56.959
Did it?

316
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.130
When you changed your number, I was really upset.

317
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.269
Did you change it to avoid me?

318
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.499
If I got another call from you,

319
00:21:04.969 --> 00:21:07.299
I thought I'd end up running to you.

320
00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.610
Is something wrong?

321
00:21:15.479 --> 00:21:16.979
Shall I come over?

322
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.819
No, later, in the evening.

323
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.420
Right now...

324
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.719
I have to do something.

325
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.759
The team follows the leader and the leader takes responsibility.

326
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.860
The full burden of responsibility rests on your shoulders.

327
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.400
I know that.

328
00:21:37.069 --> 00:21:39.170
I know what you want me to say.

329
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.499
Then say it.

330
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.340
Only the truth.

331
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:48.580
Jo Ji A...

332
00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:52.019
was my first love.

333
00:21:54.719 --> 00:21:55.819
One day,

334
00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.319
she disappeared without telling me why.

335
00:22:01.459 --> 00:22:03.989
I made Aji 3 to look like her...

336
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.259
to find the answer.

337
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.769
Now, I found the answer.

338
00:22:10.499 --> 00:22:12.499
I got to understand Ji A,

339
00:22:12.969 --> 00:22:17.110
and more than anything, I know myself better.

340
00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:21.850
With this, one chapter of my life...

341
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.120
has ended.

342
00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:27.650
You two in Geoje Island...

343
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.059
looked great together.

344
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:35.459
I mean it.

345
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.430
You looked so sweet that...

346
00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:41.630
I almost wanted to tell you everything.

347
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.769
But I lost the chance to.

348
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.870
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.940
I think the crucial moment always passes by...

350
00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:56.680
when you hesitate.

351
00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:01.690
I dropped the lawsuits.

352
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.590
I won't let Aji 3 go,

353
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.559
and I'll stop tomorrow's deal from happening.

354
00:23:08.989 --> 00:23:10.630
Not because I forgave you.

355
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.700
It's because...

356
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.340
it's the right thing to do for KM Financial.

357
00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:41.059
Come in.

358
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.559
Sir, Director Kim is here.

359
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.769
You came to see me?

360
00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:56.569
What a rare event.

361
00:23:56.969 --> 00:23:58.009
Let's sit.

362
00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:10.049
So,

363
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:11.959
why are you here?

364
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.190
I plan to...

365
00:24:15.989 --> 00:24:17.330
resign as director.

366
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.130
I'll make no management decisions.

367
00:24:21.469 --> 00:24:22.469
In return,

368
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:25.370
- I have one condition. - A condition?

369
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.509
Sell the Santa Maria Team to me.

370
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:30.539
In return for giving up KM Financial,

371
00:24:30.709 --> 00:24:33.340
you want to own the team that deceived you?

372
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.850
It's not a bad deal.

373
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.120
That would be when I didn't know about your illness.

374
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.950
You're in no condition to carry out your duties.

375
00:24:42.819 --> 00:24:44.019
Until now,

376
00:24:46.059 --> 00:24:47.559
despite my condition,

377
00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:49.229
I earned a lot of money...

378
00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:52.100
for this company.

379
00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.860
What do you think will happen...

380
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.830
if the world finds out about your illness?

381
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.969
Do you think you'll still be able to keep your position like this?

382
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.509
Please...

383
00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:05.880
do me a favor.

384
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:10.920
The Santa Maria Research Team...

385
00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:13.979
will get sold to Bold Group tomorrow.

386
00:25:14.749 --> 00:25:17.890
Doctor Hong already agreed to this.

387
00:25:18.489 --> 00:25:21.259
All that's left is for you to accept it.

388
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.959
Min Kyu.

389
00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:26.999
What do you think about voluntarily resigning from your position?

390
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.499
Have you gone mad?

391
00:25:34.969 --> 00:25:36.739
You want to keep the Santa Maria Research Team...

392
00:25:36.739 --> 00:25:39.209
in return for resigning from KM Financial?

393
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.749
You want them even though they made a fool out of you?

394
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.350
That's because they're worth fighting for.

395
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.549
Really?

396
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.719
How are they worth it?

397
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.360
Are they worth it because they're good at scamming people?

398
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.590
You always...

399
00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:58.059
gave me such a hard time and never forgave me...

400
00:25:58.729 --> 00:26:00.930
for what I did to you back when we were young.

401
00:26:01.499 --> 00:26:04.600
But you're willing to risk your money to protect those con artists?

402
00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:09.569
Have you gone insane?

403
00:26:09.569 --> 00:26:10.979
I'm perfectly sane.

404
00:26:10.979 --> 00:26:13.580
As you already know, I know how to do my math.

405
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.509
Listen to me carefully, Yoo Cheol.

406
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.019
Those people...

407
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:22.920
gave up...

408
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.360
everything they had for me.

409
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.759
I'm sure you and your father...

410
00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:31.660
will never be able to understand them.

411
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.539
(KM Financial Director, Kim Min Kyu)

412
00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.559
I won't beat around the bush.

413
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.930
I'm going to cancel your marriage with Ri El.

414
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.539
I was...

415
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.209
careless.

416
00:27:14.209 --> 00:27:16.809
You were very careless.

417
00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:20.180
Chairman Martin will be signing a contract tomorrow.

418
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.479
I'm sure you already know...

419
00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:25.150
what will happen after he signs that contract.

420
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.120
We need to do everything we can to stop this for KM Financial.

421
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.219
I'll gather the board members for an emergency meeting.

422
00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:33.420
Please help me do this.

423
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.090
Ri El will be getting married to Yoo Cheol soon.

424
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.459
That's my answer.

425
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.069
I'll start planning out your wedding with Yoo Cheol...

426
00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:51.979
as soon as we sign the contract with Bold Group.

427
00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:53.940
Dad.

428
00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.279
I told you to let me go.

429
00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:58.680
I don't want to live like this anymore.

430
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.350
You always acknowledged Min Kyu's competence.

431
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.190
You thought of him as family for 15 years.

432
00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:06.190
How can you turn your back on him so suddenly?

433
00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:09.029
Family? Who?

434
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.330
Min Kyu?

435
00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:14.130
Were you always supporting him...

436
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:17.330
with this kind of mindset?

437
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.239
Don't you feel sorry for him?

438
00:28:23.239 --> 00:28:24.809
Yes, I'm Reporter Park.

439
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.749
I just got the article via email.

440
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.719
This is interesting.

441
00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:34.090
If this goes public, it'll go crazy online.

442
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.549
And everyone will be talking about it for a while.

443
00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:40.120
I'll be on standby. Tell me whenever you're ready.

Let's go home.
