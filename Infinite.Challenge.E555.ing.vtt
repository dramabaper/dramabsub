00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:10.293
(The members are kidnapped to certain destinations.)

2
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.936
(No information is given, and they are headed to each site straight.)

3
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.706
(1 Hour Before)

4
00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:19.265
(1 hour before Haha's performance for 70th birthday)

5
00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:23.405
(Is he declaring to give up?)

6
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.546
(A birthday party expert who found the job of his life)

7
00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:29.885
(Haha finished the 70th birthday party performance 1 hour ago.)

8
00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.355
(2 hours before Se Hyeong's flight took off)

9
00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:37.586
(A kid's talent show as a cabin crew)

10
00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:40.825
(Adults' jobs are hard!)

11
00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:44.596
(1 hour ago, he was a little rapper cabin crew.)

12
00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:48.266
(1 hour before Sae Ho's weather cast program)

13
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.605
(Prepare a live broadcast in 1 hour!)

14
00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:54.836
(His fantastic debut with script collisions)

15
00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:58.675
(Working as a Jack Frost caster as a side job)

16
00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:02.615
(Determined to do a good job)

17
00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:06.216
(His job as a live weather caster was a success 1 hour ago.)

18
00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:09.186
(Now it's the big brothers' turn.)

19
00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:13.126
(A totally different situation for them 1 hour ago)

20
00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:16.296
(Their mission is about to start!)

21
00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:19.966
(1 Hour Before)

22
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.766
- Hello! - Hello.

23
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.766
- Infinite Challenge! - Challenge!

24
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.936
Continuing from last week,

25
00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:27.606
- we're shooting 1 Hour Before. - Yes. Yes.

26
00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:31.406
It's Jun Ha, Myeong Soo and my episode today.

27
00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:34.546
Sae Ho, after your episode aired,

28
00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:36.585
- did people say something? - First of all,

29
00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:38.546
people told me it was funny.

30
00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:40.686
They also said the concept was good.

31
00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:42.285
They said things like that.

32
00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:44.686
There were many people who said Se Hyeong is really cute.

33
00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:47.055
They said they wished there's a real cabin crew like him.

34
00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:48.596
- Really? - Yes. Yes.

35
00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:50.266
- Who said such things? - You're the only one who said it.

36
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.195
I think that's what people would have said. It's my assumption.

37
00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.565
- Gosh. - I think it's the same for Haha.

38
00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:55.736
They said Haha looked great at the party.

39
00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:57.636
- What looked great about him? - I mean...

40
00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:59.936
How Haha tried to party hard for old women looked cute.

41
00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.976
Don't make things up. Nobody said such things.

42
00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:04.305
Nobody did? Not even one?

43
00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:06.076
Stop lying already. Stop it.

44
00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:09.585
(1 Hour Before)

45
00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:12.046
You'll see when you get in the car and reach the destination.

46
00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:14.585
- It's the same situation for him. - What is it all about?

47
00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:16.655
Why did they put on the curtains?

48
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:20.625
What is it?

49
00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:23.465
(The car gets away with Jae Seok in it.)

50
00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.465
Gosh, it's moving. Where are we going?

51
00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:27.095
I'm driving to wherever they told me to go.

52
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.335
So where is that place that they told you to go?

53
00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:31.166
I'm only driving to wherever they directed me to go.

54
00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:34.036
The driver kept repeating the same thing.

55
00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:36.175
Can you not answer like some AI robot?

56
00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:38.206
Give me some clues at least.

57
00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.115
I don't know too.

58
00:02:41.576 --> 00:02:42.576
(Frustrated)

59
00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:44.185
This is driving me mad.

60
00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:47.085
We're going somewhere far.

61
00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.226
Hold on a second. If he makes a right turn...

62
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.486
We're near the Seongsu Bridge.

63
00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:54.895
We're driving for way too long.

64
00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:57.066
You can tell where you're going at first.

65
00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.525
We're about to get on the highway.

66
00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:02.166
I can only tell where we're going if the ride is short.

67
00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.506
Are we getting on the highway?

68
00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.006
I don't know.

69
00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:09.206
You can see it from the front.

70
00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.675
You can see where we're going.

71
00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:15.345
If I didn't come out willingly, this is almost like a kidnap.

72
00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:16.416
(Getting kidnapped at his will)

73
00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:19.486
What's that sound?

74
00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:21.856
Right. Right. Right.

75
00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:23.585
I could hear this sound in the van.

76
00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:27.055
We're at the tollgate.

77
00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:30.595
(Isn't this way to Gangwon Province?)

78
00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:33.495
(It's getting darker and darker.)

79
00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:35.835
(Passed out)

80
00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:37.036
I fell asleep.

81
00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:38.666
I was too tired.

82
00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.875
But you're sleeping in a very ugly way.

83
00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:44.976
- You went very far. - Until where did you go?

84
00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:46.215
It's driving me mad.

85
00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:50.115
Your ride was so long.

86
00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:51.986
Where are we driving up to?

87
00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:55.256
(What's happening?)

88
00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:57.155
(Going deeper into the town)

89
00:03:57.155 --> 00:03:58.726
Oh, that's where we were.

90
00:03:58.726 --> 00:04:00.256
The roads are crooked.

91
00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:02.525
Aren't we going to a mountain?

92
00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:04.296
What is it all about?

93
00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:05.566
(Getting uneasy)

94
00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:06.965
We're here.

95
00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:09.335
- Where are we? - Wear the blindfold.

96
00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:12.405
Also, wear that speaker on you. We'll guide you through.

97
00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:16.345
(They've arrived at the mountain after a long ride.)

98
00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:20.475
Please get out of the van now.

99
00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:22.616
You've selected good songs though.

100
00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:24.715
Let's go!

101
00:04:25.746 --> 00:04:27.285
- It was EDM. - Oh, the music.

102
00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:28.516
Yes, let's go now.

103
00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:30.126
Let's go now!

104
00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:31.456
Gosh.

105
00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:36.965
Goodness.

106
00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:39.566
Aren't we at some guardrail?

107
00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:44.566
We aren't going somewhere very high, are we?

108
00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.006
I hate high places.

109
00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:50.506
He's such a pathetic loser.

110
00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:52.946
- Are there more stairs? - Is that me?

111
00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:55.176
Is that me?

112
00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:56.316
Look at yourself.

113
00:04:57.415 --> 00:04:59.956
- Look at yourself. - You were teasing me hard.

114
00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:01.186
- Goodness. - Oh, what is this?

115
00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:02.756
What is this?

116
00:05:03.126 --> 00:05:06.496
(Everyone is a coward.)

117
00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:08.696
(They're all dragged in the same poses.)

118
00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:09.866
Where are we going?

119
00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.636
I fumbled so much that day.

120
00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.866
It's because you don't know what is in front of you.

121
00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:19.066
- It's really scary. - Why are we going up so high?

122
00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:21.876
He's such a coward.

123
00:05:21.876 --> 00:05:24.306
- You're walking up so much. - And they put a headphone on him.

124
00:05:24.306 --> 00:05:26.215
There are so many stairs.

125
00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:31.316
Aren't we walking the same places in order to fool me?

126
00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:37.155
- He's walking up so much. - Where are we going?

127
00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.826
- Walking up is already tiring. - Yes, it was.

128
00:05:39.826 --> 00:05:41.326
I'm too scared now.

129
00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:44.326
- It is scary. - How far did you walk up?

130
00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:46.465
- Where exactly are we going? - I hear some drones.

131
00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:48.766
You have now reached the place.

132
00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:52.136
Take five steps forward, and take off your blindfold.

133
00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:53.275
Five steps?

134
00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:55.876
(Walking carefully)

135
00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:56.905
Three.

136
00:05:58.076 --> 00:05:59.206
It's way too scary just by imagining it.

137
00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:01.775
Where are we?

138
00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:02.886
Should I take it off?

139
00:06:06.285 --> 00:06:07.386
Gosh!

140
00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:09.985
(Gosh! What is this?)

141
00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:11.386
What is it?

142
00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:13.395
- Where are we? - Gosh!

143
00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:14.696
What can it be?

144
00:06:15.056 --> 00:06:16.965
It's very scary.

145
00:06:17.665 --> 00:06:19.665
It's scary to see such cliff as soon as you take off the blindfold.

146
00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:21.165
- It's really scary. - Gosh.

147
00:06:21.835 --> 00:06:22.965
- Goodness. - What is it?

148
00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:24.566
(Startled)

149
00:06:24.605 --> 00:06:25.766
What is it?

150
00:06:27.475 --> 00:06:28.535
What is this?

151
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.145
- It's too scary. - I can't imagine standing there.

152
00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:36.186
What is this place?

153
00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:38.116
- Hello, sir. - Nice to meet you.

154
00:06:38.116 --> 00:06:39.246
Hello.

155
00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:40.456
(Mr. Kim Seung Ryeol from Wonju City Hall)

156
00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:41.556
Please come this way.

157
00:06:41.686 --> 00:06:43.985
- To where? - The manager was there.

158
00:06:45.525 --> 00:06:46.996
What are you talking about?

159
00:06:46.996 --> 00:06:49.155
(He's following him like he's bewitched.)

160
00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:50.566
(Stumbling)

161
00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:58.035
- Goodness. - Gosh!

162
00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:00.136
I can't even watch it.

163
00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:03.306
(The Sogeum Mountain's Suspension Bridge that connects peaks)

164
00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:05.306
Gosh, this is making my legs shake.

165
00:07:06.116 --> 00:07:09.386
Wonju's symbolic tour site has now built a new bridge.

166
00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:11.715
The Suspension Bridge is officially open for tourists.

167
00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:14.756
The height is 100m, and the length is 200m.

168
00:07:15.085 --> 00:07:20.496
The height equals to the 40th floor of an apartment.

169
00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:21.525
As you walk on the bridge,

170
00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:23.196
- which rocks to the sides, - What is that?

171
00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:25.866
- The bridge rocks to the sides. - you will get to enjoy the view...

172
00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:27.436
- It's scary if it's crowded. - and be in awe of the it as well.

173
00:07:27.436 --> 00:07:29.706
When I saw the coverage of the mountain in the news and articles,

174
00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:31.405
I thought that a variety show will film at the mountain.

175
00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:33.206
- And you visited the mountain. - But...

176
00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:34.405
- It was you, Jae Seok. - So...

177
00:07:34.405 --> 00:07:35.975
- The very bridge... - The rocky bridge was there.

178
00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:37.475
The very bridge unfolded before my eyes.

179
00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.145
(His brain stops working.)

180
00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:44.485
Why am I at Suspension Bridge?

181
00:07:44.686 --> 00:07:46.456
- Before the tourists enter, - Okay.

182
00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:49.556
you must clean the bridge and make it spotless.

183
00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:51.725
- He wanted... - You want me to clean the bridge?

184
00:07:51.725 --> 00:07:52.725
Yes.

185
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:54.956
(This bridge?)

186
00:07:55.295 --> 00:07:56.965
- My goodness. - My mind went blank at that time.

187
00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:58.395
That must have been scary.

188
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.436
Right now, it's 8am. You have 1 hour before the opening.

189
00:08:01.636 --> 00:08:02.735
You must hurry.

190
00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:04.735
I can't sweep without looking down.

191
00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:10.506
(Until the opening of the Suspension Bridge at Mount Sogeum,)

192
00:08:10.506 --> 00:08:11.706
(there's 1 hour left.)

193
00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:14.145
It's an hour before the opening. Please hurry, and clean.

194
00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:19.215
My gosh, how am I supposed to sweep the bridge?

195
00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:20.886
Wait, hold on!

196
00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:24.256
(Jae Seok, the scaredy-cat of Infinite Challenge,)

197
00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:28.156
(is in charge of cleaning the 100m-high Suspension Bridge?)

198
00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:32.696
- If 1 of 2 ends is cut, he'll fall. - Exactly.

199
00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:35.235
- Right. - It will be just like the movie.

200
00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:38.436
You know how you can hear the wind blowing at a high altitude?

201
00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:39.605
I can't believe this.

202
00:08:39.776 --> 00:08:41.875
(Will he be able to finish the job on time?)

203
00:08:44.046 --> 00:08:45.046
Hello.

204
00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:47.715
- You are already here. - That's Jun Ha.

205
00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:48.776
That's right.

206
00:08:49.416 --> 00:08:50.446
(He shows up with full of worry.)

207
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.446
First off,

208
00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:56.255
I'm trying to kick off 2018 with positive energy.

209
00:08:56.255 --> 00:08:58.286
I've been preparing myself.

210
00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:00.696
It's a fun job, right?

211
00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:01.956
What do you think it'd be?

212
00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:06.196
I don't know. Sae Ho made history with his gig.

213
00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.166
Start the timer after telling me what it is.

214
00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:10.906
You can get in the car now.

215
00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:14.335
- This one? - His job started right away.

216
00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:15.335
He did indeed.

217
00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:19.946
I guess it's not that hard since you look quite happy.

218
00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:21.646
I bet it's something fun.

219
00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:24.515
If the staff members look down,

220
00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:26.456
I'd know. The job would be a difficult one.

221
00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:28.715
Everyone looks so happy.

222
00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:29.725
(What a detective.)

223
00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:32.686
- It's not a hard one, right? - He catches on really fast.

224
00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:34.225
(Drawing it open)

225
00:09:34.495 --> 00:09:35.495
My goodness.

226
00:09:35.755 --> 00:09:37.426
Seriously. They are going all out for it.

227
00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:39.696
This is a specialized vehicle for celebrities.

228
00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.595
This is like the changing room.

229
00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:45.036
He's stalling time until he gets into the car.

230
00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:47.875
- He's trying his best. - That's all I have.

231
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:48.875
Okay.

232
00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:51.345
By the way, time is ticking now.

233
00:09:51.345 --> 00:09:52.605
Then I should hurry.

234
00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:53.676
(He sounds energetic.)

235
00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:55.316
We're leaving now.

236
00:09:55.715 --> 00:09:57.946
You guys did a great job at keeping this a secret.

237
00:09:58.416 --> 00:10:00.816
I'm not going to go to Nodeul Island and get on the helicopter, right?

238
00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:02.885
You wouldn't repeat the same special.

239
00:10:04.786 --> 00:10:06.296
- He's eating something. - He's eating again.

240
00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:08.156
- Look at him. - That day, my wife...

241
00:10:08.156 --> 00:10:09.625
made me rice balls.

242
00:10:10.465 --> 00:10:12.625
If I didn't eat the rice balls, I would've been in serious trouble.

243
00:10:13.235 --> 00:10:15.835
Press the button, and take your parking ticket.

244
00:10:16.536 --> 00:10:18.105
Please proceed into the parking lot.

245
00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:19.105
"Parking lot"?

246
00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:22.536
(He arrives quickly.)

247
00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:25.676
- Jun Ha, we have arrived. - Okay.

248
00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:27.316
- It didn't take long. - That was quick.

249
00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:28.975
- Put on the headphone, please. - You got there quickly.

250
00:10:28.975 --> 00:10:31.385
- It wasn't that far away. - That's why they started the timer.

251
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:33.456
- It began when he got on the car. - Right.

252
00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:35.885
Here we go again. It's starting again.

253
00:10:36.255 --> 00:10:37.355
My gosh, it feels weird.

254
00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:38.585
(In no time, his energy has disappeared.)

255
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.796
The song is so upbeat, but I don't feel cheerful at all.

256
00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:43.365
I'm scared all of a sudden now.

257
00:10:43.365 --> 00:10:44.826
(That's not what you said earlier.)

258
00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:47.335
(It was only 45 minutes ago.)

259
00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:49.536
(Shall we listen to it energetically just like you promised to be?)

260
00:10:50.235 --> 00:10:54.406
(My gosh, this is crazy.)

261
00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:56.875
I've been preparing myself.

262
00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:58.176
(But I don't feel cheerful at all.)

263
00:10:58.505 --> 00:11:00.015
I'm scared all of a sudden now.

264
00:11:00.146 --> 00:11:01.946
(His baritone voice and his build remind of Jay-Z.)

265
00:11:02.615 --> 00:11:04.786
I'm trying to kick off 2018 with positive energy.

266
00:11:04.786 --> 00:11:05.786
(But I don't feel cheerful at all.)

267
00:11:06.316 --> 00:11:07.885
(His whining rap sounds like he's criticizing the society.)

268
00:11:09.686 --> 00:11:10.725
(Master of Hip Hop)

269
00:11:10.725 --> 00:11:11.956
I guess I'm going somewhere now.

270
00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:13.355
Are you serious right now?

271
00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:15.196
- He's getting special treatment. - What is this?

272
00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:16.196
Why are you doing that?

273
00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:17.625
- You did it on purpose, no? - They turned him into a rapper.

274
00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:18.625
- Seriously. - But you don't do that for me.

275
00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:21.896
They had to do that. Watch what happens next.

276
00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:25.666
(Jun Ha is released.)

277
00:11:26.605 --> 00:11:27.605
My gosh,

278
00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:29.375
I really hate it when you do this.

279
00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:30.776
(I really hate it.)

280
00:11:31.605 --> 00:11:33.946
I'm trying to kick off 2018 with positive energy.

281
00:11:33.946 --> 00:11:37.416
I'll do a good job. I'll be funny. Gosh, where am I going?

282
00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:38.816
They outsourced the editing job.

283
00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:39.816
Hey.

284
00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:43.056
Do you know how scary it is to walk with the blindfold on? Do you?

285
00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:44.156
Of course, I know.

286
00:11:44.156 --> 00:11:45.426
(We did the same thing.)

287
00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:46.956
Where am I going?

288
00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:51.995
All right. I must work with positive energy. Let's be cheerful.

289
00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:52.995
(There's fear in his voice.)

290
00:11:53.595 --> 00:11:55.135
Why are we walking a lot?

291
00:11:55.796 --> 00:11:57.605
I have a bad feeling about this.

292
00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:00.776
What is this?

293
00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:02.676
What is this?

294
00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:05.005
You should have parked in front of the place then.

295
00:12:05.005 --> 00:12:06.446
(His walk comes to an end at last.)

296
00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:09.546
He's there. He's at the place now. This is it.

297
00:12:09.546 --> 00:12:10.546
What is this?

298
00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:12.515
What's going on?

299
00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:14.686
(Jun Ha's point of view, darkness)

300
00:12:15.186 --> 00:12:16.725
- His face is so big. - What's going on?

301
00:12:17.426 --> 00:12:18.686
- He said Jun Ha's face is big. - "His face is so big."

302
00:12:18.686 --> 00:12:21.095
He said that pretty loud. "His face is so big."

303
00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:23.396
- What? - Jun Ha, take off your blindfold.

304
00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:28.896
(He wants to start 2018 with positive energy.)

305
00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:30.765
(This will be the starting point. Where is he?)

306
00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:32.806
(Blinking)

307
00:12:32.806 --> 00:12:34.505
They even put a close-up of his eyes.

308
00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:35.536
What is this?

309
00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:37.605
(Everyone seems cheerful.)

310
00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:40.015
- This is no joke. - I bet he was flustered.

311
00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:43.745
- Mr. Jung Jun Ha. - Yes?

312
00:12:44.416 --> 00:12:45.515
This is a season-off marathon.

313
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.885
(Welcome to the marathon.)

314
00:12:47.885 --> 00:12:49.355
- What? - Thank you for your participation.

315
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.585
(Do you like to run marathons?)

316
00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:54.995
You have to prepare yourself in order to run a marathon.

317
00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:57.426
- That's true. - They gave me 10 minutes only.

318
00:12:57.896 --> 00:12:59.066
It was 10 minutes before starting.

319
00:12:59.066 --> 00:13:01.265
Jun Ha had only 10 minutes, not 1 hour.

320
00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:02.296
Exactly.

321
00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:04.436
- Han River was frozen that day too. - But...

322
00:13:04.436 --> 00:13:06.806
- It must have been really hard. - But people still run marathons.

323
00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:10.046
- Marathon? - Today, you will run 10km...

324
00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.176
(10km course)

325
00:13:11.176 --> 00:13:12.245
for this marathon.

326
00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:13.816
- 10km? - That's not easy.

327
00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:15.345
Running 10km is really hard.

328
00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.485
A lot of people came out even on a cold day.

329
00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:20.215
- I'm running a marathon? - They are incredible.

330
00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:24.725
(The center of the attention in this marathon)

331
00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:25.826
Season-off marathon?

332
00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:26.896
(The center of the attention in this marathon)

333
00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:29.666
This is really happening. Everyone came for the marathon.

334
00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:33.536
I should've gotten good night's sleep and prepare myself...

335
00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:34.936
- if I'm running a marathon. - That's right.

336
00:13:35.495 --> 00:13:36.536
What's this?

337
00:13:36.706 --> 00:13:39.005
It's freezing cold. Why am I running a marathon today?

338
00:13:39.206 --> 00:13:41.776
I'm trying to kick off 2018 with positive energy.

339
00:13:42.306 --> 00:13:43.576
(Your wish just came true.)

340
00:13:43.576 --> 00:13:44.576
My goodness.

341
00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:48.115
How am I going to do this?

342
00:13:48.816 --> 00:13:50.085
Hey, how could I clean this bridge?

343
00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:54.686
(200m-long Suspension Bridge)

344
00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:56.725
(He wants to cry.)

345
00:13:56.725 --> 00:13:58.085
This is crazy.

346
00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:01.896
(He musters up courage and moves forward.)

347
00:14:01.896 --> 00:14:03.225
Oh, my. This bridge...

348
00:14:05.896 --> 00:14:07.566
- My goodness. - Why are you sweeping there?

349
00:14:07.566 --> 00:14:08.896
- I couldn't bring myself to cross. - How could I do this?

350
00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:11.066
I didn't have the guts to do it.

351
00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:12.306
You should've moved forward, not backward.

352
00:14:12.306 --> 00:14:13.406
I was scared.

353
00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:14.975
- I... - Are you cleaning its surroundings?

354
00:14:14.975 --> 00:14:16.806
That wasn't my decision to clean it.

355
00:14:16.806 --> 00:14:18.206
It's even snowing today.

356
00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:19.946
(Clanging)

357
00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:20.975
My goodness.

358
00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:23.946
- Jae Seok gets scared so easily. - Oh, my.

359
00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.385
- That wasn't the whole picture. - It's an extreme part-time job.

360
00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:28.115
Goodness, I'm about to lose it.

361
00:14:28.115 --> 00:14:29.585
How am I going to do this job?

362
00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.625
- My gosh, how could you clean it? - How can I clean this?

363
00:14:33.826 --> 00:14:35.595
I wouldn't have been able to do the job.

364
00:14:36.196 --> 00:14:37.896
Five minutes have already passed.

365
00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:38.965
(5 minutes have already passed.)

366
00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:43.335
Hey, stop talking. Hey, you.

367
00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:44.906
(5 minutes and 3 seconds passed now.)

368
00:14:45.735 --> 00:14:46.776
(The bridge seems too long.)

369
00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:48.605
Oh, my. This is insane. This is...

370
00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:51.005
This is too high.

371
00:14:51.345 --> 00:14:53.546
- It was too high. - I do agree. It's really high.

372
00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:54.845
- Seriously. - I'd hate it.

373
00:14:56.316 --> 00:14:57.615
- Goodness. - He's starting.

374
00:14:57.615 --> 00:14:59.885
- He's doing it though. - I was projecting onto the leaves.

375
00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:00.885
If I fall...

376
00:15:01.085 --> 00:15:02.456
Let's try the best I can.

377
00:15:04.355 --> 00:15:05.456
I'll do as much as I can.

378
00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:09.796
- The middle part had holes? - To be honest...

379
00:15:09.796 --> 00:15:10.896
I don't know. I didn't pay attention.

380
00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:12.365
You would have to cross again to return.

381
00:15:12.365 --> 00:15:14.896
What's scary is that tourists can face forward...

382
00:15:14.896 --> 00:15:16.605
- and cross the bridge. - My goodness.

383
00:15:16.806 --> 00:15:18.666
- He has to look at the bottom. - He must look down.

384
00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:21.036
- Up to that point is doable. - Oh, my.

385
00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.375
(He passes the section where he could see the ground.)

386
00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:23.875
- He has to walk 200m. - The middle part... No way.

387
00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:25.875
(He's heading toward the valley, a higher section.)

388
00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:30.316
- You all sympathize with me. - Of course.

389
00:15:30.316 --> 00:15:31.345
Right.

390
00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:34.656
I guess someone has to clean the bridge because of the leaves.

391
00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:37.056
- The cameraman approached him. - You startled me.

392
00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:39.085
Don't come.

393
00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:40.556
Don't come. It's shaking.

394
00:15:43.326 --> 00:15:46.396
It's so weird. Aren't our staff members scared of height?

395
00:15:46.396 --> 00:15:48.465
- I know, right? - The staff members make us...

396
00:15:48.465 --> 00:15:50.706
- look like we're bigger cowards. - Exactly.

397
00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:55.975
(He makes a U-turn.)

398
00:15:57.076 --> 00:15:58.946
- Why are you running away? - Because I'm scared.

399
00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:01.176
- Did you come back? - Yes.

400
00:16:01.615 --> 00:16:03.715
I couldn't move forward further than that.

401
00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:05.515
10 minutes have passed.

402
00:16:05.985 --> 00:16:08.585
- You cleaned 7m for 10 minutes. - That's enough.

403
00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:09.956
Stop it.

404
00:16:10.556 --> 00:16:13.095
Stop talking! Unbelievable.

405
00:16:13.896 --> 00:16:16.196
You keep teasing me.

406
00:16:17.625 --> 00:16:19.995
(Anyway, I can't believe 10 minutes have already passed.)

407
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:23.566
(50 minutes before greeting the tourists)

408
00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:28.835
My gosh. It's not like I can skip this part of the job.

409
00:16:29.646 --> 00:16:31.406
- But I'm scared to clean this. - Seriously.

410
00:16:31.706 --> 00:16:32.975
Shoot.

411
00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:34.875
Darn it!

412
00:16:35.176 --> 00:16:37.146
- I hate the bridge. I hate it. - My goodness.

413
00:16:37.845 --> 00:16:40.816
I hate it too. I completely understand. Yes, come back.

414
00:16:41.355 --> 00:16:43.326
- That's more like you. - There's a valley there!

415
00:16:43.725 --> 00:16:46.095
- He's such a coward though. - I saw a valley there.

416
00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:49.255
Hey, I saw a valley down there.

417
00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:52.365
You should go. Go. Go see it for yourself. Go.

418
00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:54.196
Go and try to sweep the bridge yourself.

419
00:16:54.965 --> 00:16:56.206
If I go, are you going to sweep it?

420
00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:57.636
- Sorry? - If I go, will you clean it?

421
00:16:57.636 --> 00:16:59.606
Go. Talk to me after you've been there.

422
00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:00.735
Tell me after you try.

423
00:17:02.275 --> 00:17:04.775
- Is he serious? - He wasn't scared at all.

424
00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:05.775
Look at him.

425
00:17:06.245 --> 00:17:08.446
He's showing off. Look at him filming the bottom of the bridge.

426
00:17:08.715 --> 00:17:10.045
He wants to show it to me.

427
00:17:10.346 --> 00:17:13.356
He's doing that just to shove it in my face.

428
00:17:13.856 --> 00:17:15.456
Fine. Good for you, Hyun Suk.

429
00:17:15.555 --> 00:17:17.755
I am glad you aren't afraid of heights.

430
00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:21.055
(They shout together.)

431
00:17:22.225 --> 00:17:23.926
Every one of us is a coward.

432
00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:26.096
Look at him.

433
00:17:26.096 --> 00:17:27.196
He is showing off.

434
00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:29.336
Hyun Suk.

435
00:17:30.265 --> 00:17:31.535
I am jealous of you, Hyun Suk.

436
00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:34.406
Good for him, that show-off.

437
00:17:34.936 --> 00:17:36.775
This is driving me crazy.

438
00:17:36.775 --> 00:17:38.446
(He goes back to his post.)

439
00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:42.245
(At that moment)

440
00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:45.446
Tae Ho can be so annoying.

441
00:17:45.446 --> 00:17:46.656
- Look at him jump up and down. - Don't move!

442
00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:48.156
Don't move!

443
00:17:49.215 --> 00:17:50.285
(Turning around)

444
00:17:50.956 --> 00:17:52.586
(He freezes.)

445
00:17:53.626 --> 00:17:54.995
(Jumping)

446
00:17:55.696 --> 00:17:56.926
Gosh, I can't believe Tae Ho.

447
00:17:56.926 --> 00:17:59.636
- He is like a Jiangshi. - Look at him jump up and down.

448
00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:03.336
(He runs away for the 3rd time.)

449
00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:04.436
You!

450
00:18:04.565 --> 00:18:05.805
It's a difficult job.

451
00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:07.606
Tae Ho!

452
00:18:08.235 --> 00:18:09.646
I will end you!

453
00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:11.846
- You should have kicked him. - Don't come here.

454
00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.015
Don't come to the bridge.

455
00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:14.676
You keep shaking it.

456
00:18:14.975 --> 00:18:16.146
Don't shake it.

457
00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:17.586
I am serious.

458
00:18:20.815 --> 00:18:22.485
(Buzzing)

459
00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:23.785
Don't film me!

460
00:18:25.055 --> 00:18:26.456
(He takes out his anger on the drone.)

461
00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:27.596
What should I do?

462
00:18:31.896 --> 00:18:34.366
(I have a good idea.)

463
00:18:35.666 --> 00:18:37.465
(I am fine as long as I don't see anything.)

464
00:18:37.465 --> 00:18:39.005
- That could be better. - Please take me there.

465
00:18:39.005 --> 00:18:40.775
It will be scarier.

466
00:18:41.906 --> 00:18:43.446
It's a lot better when I can't see anything.

467
00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:44.545
(He follows the fearless staff to the front.)

468
00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:47.176
Gosh, I hate that.

469
00:18:48.515 --> 00:18:50.315
I think I am there. Am I there?

470
00:18:50.315 --> 00:18:51.416
(He goes past the part he swept earlier.)

471
00:18:52.616 --> 00:18:54.456
(He is above the deepest part of the valley.)

472
00:18:54.456 --> 00:18:55.616
I think I should stop here.

473
00:18:55.785 --> 00:18:57.025
Did I reach this far earlier?

474
00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:58.586
Is it here?

475
00:18:58.586 --> 00:19:01.126
(He unknowingly stands 100m above ground.)

476
00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:02.295
Let's clean.

477
00:19:04.465 --> 00:19:06.235
- I think I am doing it right. - My goodness.

478
00:19:06.366 --> 00:19:08.065
He will be shocked if he takes off his blindfold.

479
00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:11.305
The bridge is shaking.

480
00:19:12.206 --> 00:19:14.235
- The result is the same. - What is he doing?

481
00:19:14.676 --> 00:19:16.305
How many times is he going back?

482
00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:17.775
- For goodness' sake. - You!

483
00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:20.446
- I will get you! - It's scary.

484
00:19:20.446 --> 00:19:22.676
Is this a game of tag?

485
00:19:25.285 --> 00:19:27.956
(It's 30 minutes before the opening.)

486
00:19:27.956 --> 00:19:29.215
The bridge shakes so much.

487
00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:32.825
Okay. Let's get this done quickly.

488
00:19:32.825 --> 00:19:35.356
(He musters up his courage and goes.)

489
00:19:36.225 --> 00:19:37.325
My goodness.

490
00:19:37.325 --> 00:19:39.196
It's high.

491
00:19:39.265 --> 00:19:41.636
Before I reached that point, I saw the ground right below me.

492
00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:42.805
That wasn't the case anymore.

493
00:19:43.336 --> 00:19:44.666
(He is in the air.)

494
00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:47.406
- These leaves... - You can see below the bridge.

495
00:19:47.406 --> 00:19:48.535
That's right.

496
00:19:48.676 --> 00:19:50.846
Gosh, it's so high.

497
00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:52.346
I wouldn't be able to do that by myself.

498
00:19:52.346 --> 00:19:53.775
Seriously.

499
00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:55.116
That's...

500
00:19:59.586 --> 00:20:00.956
- What are you doing? - Could it be...

501
00:20:01.156 --> 00:20:02.515
You won't, will you?

502
00:20:02.725 --> 00:20:04.626
Come on!

503
00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:07.196
(Come on!)

504
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.465
- For goodness' sake. - I really...

505
00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.196
It takes a while to run back.

506
00:20:12.465 --> 00:20:13.965
It's a workout.

507
00:20:13.965 --> 00:20:15.366
(He is running more than he would in a marathon.)

508
00:20:17.636 --> 00:20:20.275
(He must go.)

509
00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:23.906
- Please. - What are you muttering?

510
00:20:23.906 --> 00:20:25.245
I don't even know.

511
00:20:25.245 --> 00:20:26.545
What is he saying?

512
00:20:27.846 --> 00:20:28.876
(Stopping)

513
00:20:28.876 --> 00:20:30.116
Come on!

514
00:20:30.515 --> 00:20:31.985
- He is so annoying. - I couldn't help it.

515
00:20:31.985 --> 00:20:34.356
I feel like I am watching a movie that keeps rewinding.

516
00:20:34.356 --> 00:20:35.755
The movie keeps rewinding.

517
00:20:35.755 --> 00:20:37.825
- I am sorry. - I don't know what happens next.

518
00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:39.926
- It rewinds again and again. - Seriously.

519
00:20:41.495 --> 00:20:43.626
I don't have much time.

520
00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:45.896
I don't have much time.

521
00:20:46.065 --> 00:20:47.936
It's like a movie about wolves.

522
00:20:49.295 --> 00:20:51.465
It's difficult to watch.

523
00:20:53.206 --> 00:20:54.275
(Groaning)

524
00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:56.305
(He becomes aware of his surroundings intermittently.)

525
00:20:56.305 --> 00:20:57.745
Look at that.

526
00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:00.975
He is coming back again.

527
00:21:01.116 --> 00:21:02.176
He needs to stop.

528
00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:03.785
It will be faster to run the other direction.

529
00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:05.646
My goodness.

530
00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:06.856
- "He needs to stop." - "He needs to stop."

531
00:21:08.515 --> 00:21:10.186
The way back is too long.

532
00:21:15.656 --> 00:21:16.995
It's so high.

533
00:21:16.995 --> 00:21:17.995
(Filming with a drone)

534
00:21:18.426 --> 00:21:20.136
Even on the screen, it looks so high.

535
00:21:20.136 --> 00:21:21.336
Jae Seok is flying a drone...

536
00:21:21.336 --> 00:21:22.396
Oh, that's not Jae Seok.

537
00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:25.465
"That's not Jae Seok"?

538
00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:26.975
Stop it already.

539
00:21:26.975 --> 00:21:28.636
It's like they purposely chose someone...

540
00:21:28.636 --> 00:21:30.275
who looks like Jae Seok.

541
00:21:30.946 --> 00:21:33.676
More than anything, I was worried about the time...

542
00:21:33.676 --> 00:21:35.646
because I had to be done before the tourists came in.

543
00:21:35.646 --> 00:21:37.715
It put me under pressure.

544
00:21:37.715 --> 00:21:39.485
- I bet it did. - Yes.

545
00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:41.156
What should I do?

546
00:21:49.196 --> 00:21:50.366
I need to clean it up.

547
00:21:50.366 --> 00:21:52.366
(He still has to sweep half the bridge.)

548
00:21:53.136 --> 00:21:54.896
It's impossible to sweep without looking down.

549
00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:56.836
This is driving me crazy.

550
00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:05.176
That end is closer.

551
00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:06.876
He is running in the opposite direction this time.

552
00:22:07.045 --> 00:22:08.215
He finally began to run that way.

553
00:22:08.215 --> 00:22:10.146
"He finally began to run that way."

554
00:22:10.146 --> 00:22:11.386
They were talking about me.

555
00:22:11.686 --> 00:22:13.086
For goodness' sake.

556
00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:26.065
(The tourists go up the stairs.)

557
00:22:27.235 --> 00:22:29.166
(Forlorn)

558
00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:34.235
Don't look down.

559
00:22:36.035 --> 00:22:37.206
Don't look down.

560
00:22:37.805 --> 00:22:38.906
Don't look down.

561
00:22:39.475 --> 00:22:42.475
(He has less than a minute left.)

562
00:22:43.886 --> 00:22:45.846
It was a lonely fight.

563
00:22:45.846 --> 00:22:47.656
(He runs like he is in a battlefield.)

564
00:22:57.565 --> 00:22:59.965
(You would think it's a natural disaster movie.)

565
00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:02.936
(Crying)

566
00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:06.005
- Are you being chased? - It's a chase.

567
00:23:06.005 --> 00:23:07.436
- For goodness' sake. - He's being chased by someone.

568
00:23:07.436 --> 00:23:09.745
They edited the video in a strange way.

569
00:23:13.545 --> 00:23:15.215
(The visitors start to enter the Suspension Bridge.)

570
00:23:16.616 --> 00:23:18.116
- It's Yu Jae Seok. - It's Yu Jae Seok.

571
00:23:18.715 --> 00:23:20.086
That child...

572
00:23:20.356 --> 00:23:22.356
made me embarrassed.

573
00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:23.626
What?

574
00:23:23.626 --> 00:23:24.856
(Oh, it's Yu Jae Seok.)

575
00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:26.356
He is a child.

576
00:23:26.626 --> 00:23:29.356
(He goes on his own way.)

577
00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:34.235
I am sorry. I should've cleaned faster.

578
00:23:34.535 --> 00:23:35.836
The visitors are here already.

579
00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:37.206
(The bridge begins to get crowded.)

580
00:23:37.235 --> 00:23:39.005
You are sweeping because you feel bad.

581
00:23:39.035 --> 00:23:41.075
- Seeing the visitors woke me up. - I need to sweep...

582
00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:42.975
so that the visitors can enjoy the bridge.

583
00:23:42.975 --> 00:23:45.475
(He sweeps before the visitors.)

584
00:23:45.475 --> 00:23:46.946
You are blocking the way.

585
00:23:48.275 --> 00:23:49.616
My goodness.

586
00:23:50.146 --> 00:23:51.416
What is he doing?

587
00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:53.886
- It looks like he is curling. - For goodness' sake.

588
00:23:53.886 --> 00:23:55.285
I said this,

589
00:23:55.285 --> 00:23:56.856
but I am an utter fool.

590
00:23:58.755 --> 00:24:01.525
- I am sorry. - You are almost done.

591
00:24:02.126 --> 00:24:04.265
- Hello. - My goodness.

592
00:24:04.596 --> 00:24:06.295
- It's Yu Jae Seok. - Hello.

593
00:24:06.936 --> 00:24:07.995
For goodness' sake.

594
00:24:07.995 --> 00:24:09.666
(He is forced to take a picture.)

595
00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:13.775
In 1, 2, 3.

596
00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:18.406
(He jumps 10cm when he is 100m above the ground.)

597
00:24:19.346 --> 00:24:21.176
(He is in tatters.)

598
00:24:22.015 --> 00:24:24.815
He must be feeling...

599
00:24:24.815 --> 00:24:27.315
- a sense of defeat. - That's right.

600
00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:28.856
- A sense of shame. - A sense of shame.

601
00:24:28.856 --> 00:24:32.686
You took the least amount of time.

602
00:24:34.396 --> 00:24:36.495
I need to take a look at my pants when I go home.

603
00:24:37.465 --> 00:24:39.465
I haven't talked about it before, but I am worried.

604
00:24:39.465 --> 00:24:40.866
You might have soiled your pants.

605
00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:42.196
You filmed a chase so many times today.

606
00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:44.535
You did it all by yourself.

607
00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:48.075
(He finds a new genre in variety shows.)

608
00:24:48.075 --> 00:24:50.075
As I hiked down the mountain,

609
00:24:50.146 --> 00:24:52.376
I saw someone carry a machine on his back.

610
00:24:52.376 --> 00:24:53.775
It was a leaf blower.

611
00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:57.086
When I asked him about it,

612
00:24:57.086 --> 00:24:59.285
he went, "Who uses a broom these days?"

613
00:24:59.285 --> 00:25:00.755
- They use a leaf blower. - Yes.

614
00:25:00.755 --> 00:25:03.656
They made me use a broom even though there was a leaf blower.

615
00:25:03.656 --> 00:25:05.325
We found out about it later.

616
00:25:05.325 --> 00:25:06.995
- Excuse me? - Stop lying.

617
00:25:06.995 --> 00:25:08.255
You didn't find out about it later.

618
00:25:08.255 --> 00:25:09.696
They drive me crazy.

619
00:25:10.065 --> 00:25:12.196
Let's see where Jun Ha is at.

620
00:25:12.196 --> 00:25:13.836
- That's right. - For goodness' sake.

621
00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:15.336
I have to do this no matter what, right?

622
00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:16.465
(Jun Ha is running a marathon.)

623
00:25:16.465 --> 00:25:19.035
It's five minutes before the start.

624
00:25:19.035 --> 00:25:20.735
Massage your body with care.

625
00:25:20.735 --> 00:25:23.206
I can't believe you told me 10 minutes before the start.

626
00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:25.305
All right.

627
00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:26.715
I don't have much time.

628
00:25:26.715 --> 00:25:29.646
(He does everything he needs to do.)

629
00:25:30.045 --> 00:25:32.785
Back in the days, Jun Ha ran a marathon with Kwang Hee.

630
00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:35.416
- That's right. - He is good at it.

631
00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:37.755
Jun Ha has run a marathon before.

632
00:25:37.956 --> 00:25:39.825
This is incredible. You will suddenly run a marathon.

633
00:25:39.825 --> 00:25:41.096
This is a disaster.

634
00:25:41.126 --> 00:25:42.765
When did you apply?

635
00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:44.765
When did you apply?

636
00:25:44.765 --> 00:25:46.666
- A month ago. - A month ago?

637
00:25:46.995 --> 00:25:49.196
I didn't even apply for this.

638
00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:52.305
I hope you will complete the race.

639
00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:54.176
(Laughing)

640
00:25:54.176 --> 00:25:56.206
- I found out about this just now. - Let's go, Jung Jun Ha!

641
00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:57.575
- Let's go. - Let's go.

642
00:25:57.575 --> 00:26:00.146
I just found out about this.

643
00:26:00.176 --> 00:26:02.146
Let's cheer for Jung Jun Ha!

644
00:26:02.146 --> 00:26:03.916
- Let's go. - He is good at revving people up.

645
00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:05.745
Thank you. Thank you, but...

646
00:26:05.745 --> 00:26:07.416
Don't give up in the middle.

647
00:26:07.416 --> 00:26:09.586
- I didn't apply for this. - No?

648
00:26:09.725 --> 00:26:11.126
I found out about this just now.

649
00:26:11.126 --> 00:26:13.196
- Really? - Yes.

650
00:26:14.956 --> 00:26:18.265
(He begins to stretch.)

651
00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:19.936
(He does his best.)

652
00:26:19.936 --> 00:26:21.696
Put your hands up in the air.

653
00:26:21.696 --> 00:26:23.805
Shout out loud...

654
00:26:23.805 --> 00:26:25.106
for five seconds.

655
00:26:25.305 --> 00:26:26.535
(Shouting)

656
00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:28.106
(He is excited.)

657
00:26:28.805 --> 00:26:30.946
It's a minute before the start.

658
00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:32.106
- A minute. - Again,

659
00:26:32.106 --> 00:26:33.646
put your hands up in the air.

660
00:26:33.646 --> 00:26:36.686
Shout out loud.

661
00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:38.886
(Energetic)

662
00:26:38.886 --> 00:26:40.586
You are the most enthusiastic one.

663
00:26:40.616 --> 00:26:43.086
I thought I was watching "Show Me the Money".

664
00:26:43.886 --> 00:26:45.985
- There was a similar scene. - That's right.

665
00:26:47.795 --> 00:26:50.666
(He does this every year.)

666
00:26:51.196 --> 00:26:52.525
What am I doing?

667
00:26:53.565 --> 00:26:55.265
- What's going on? - Put your hands down.

668
00:26:55.366 --> 00:26:57.866
- Put your hands down. - You have to run with me.

669
00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:00.706
Why did you look so cheerful?

670
00:27:00.906 --> 00:27:02.436
The Han River is frozen.

671
00:27:03.346 --> 00:27:06.116
Please complete the race safely.

672
00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:07.575
Where are we going?

673
00:27:08.275 --> 00:27:09.616
I see Jamsil Sports Complex.

674
00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:12.815
Where am I? I am at Jamsil.

675
00:27:14.255 --> 00:27:17.126
They did a lot of video editing.

676
00:27:17.426 --> 00:27:19.285
He needs to know about the course.

677
00:27:19.325 --> 00:27:20.396
Scream together.

678
00:27:20.396 --> 00:27:22.126
Even the number is huge.

679
00:27:22.295 --> 00:27:23.525
Look how big it is.

680
00:27:23.525 --> 00:27:24.995
- 3. - 3.

681
00:27:24.995 --> 00:27:26.535
- 2. - 2.

682
00:27:26.636 --> 00:27:27.896
- 1. - 1.

683
00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:29.265
- He's running. - Start.

684
00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:32.406
- Start. - It's a 10km marathon.

685
00:27:32.406 --> 00:27:35.176
(Start)

686
00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:37.346
The marathon has started.

687
00:27:37.376 --> 00:27:39.815
I'm mentally prepared to start...

688
00:27:39.815 --> 00:27:42.045
the year 2018 energetically.

689
00:27:42.785 --> 00:27:47.785
(He's a man who keeps his words.)

690
00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:49.985
(It's a smooth start.)

691
00:27:49.985 --> 00:27:51.656
They show a close-up.

692
00:27:52.995 --> 00:27:55.025
I just continue running.

693
00:27:55.926 --> 00:27:59.025
(He only focuses on the essence.)

694
00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:03.035
(He runs forward quietly with determination.)

695
00:28:03.065 --> 00:28:05.265
Is the cameraman running with him?

696
00:28:06.575 --> 00:28:09.446
- They're running with him. - Those filming...

697
00:28:09.446 --> 00:28:12.446
are running sideways and backwards.

698
00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:15.715
How can I be funny? How can I make it fun?

699
00:28:15.715 --> 00:28:16.946
You should run like this.

700
00:28:16.946 --> 00:28:18.745
Your gait should be funny.

701
00:28:18.745 --> 00:28:19.755
(Make it entertaining.)

702
00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:20.785
Make a funny face.

703
00:28:20.785 --> 00:28:23.285
- It needs many special effects. - I really couldn't.

704
00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:26.495
There was a reason why it was fancy in the beginning.

705
00:28:27.696 --> 00:28:29.565
All he does is run.

706
00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:32.495
We're watching him run.

707
00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:34.565
Does anything happen during the run?

708
00:28:34.565 --> 00:28:36.765
- I couldn't... - Did you find money?

709
00:28:36.765 --> 00:28:38.465
Did you find money or anything?

710
00:28:38.465 --> 00:28:40.336
- How could I? - You should have fell on...

711
00:28:40.336 --> 00:28:41.975
- dog poop. - Why didn't you find a wallet...

712
00:28:41.975 --> 00:28:44.005
and return it to the police station?

713
00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:47.215
What could he do while running?

714
00:28:47.376 --> 00:28:49.146
- There's nothing. - Why didn't you sing...

715
00:28:49.146 --> 00:28:50.646
or keep farting?

716
00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:52.015
You should have sung a song.

717
00:28:52.086 --> 00:28:55.186
Call out for your wife or tear your clothes.

718
00:28:55.186 --> 00:28:56.626
Will it end like this?

719
00:28:56.626 --> 00:28:58.825
Do you just run?

720
00:28:58.886 --> 00:29:01.126
- I just continue running. - If this is...

721
00:29:01.126 --> 00:29:03.995
all he does, it'll be like a documentary of Norway.

722
00:29:04.325 --> 00:29:06.596
It only shows moose walking.

723
00:29:06.866 --> 00:29:09.666
(Fast-forward by 20 times)

724
00:29:09.666 --> 00:29:11.836
- In entertainment these days, - Seriously.

725
00:29:11.836 --> 00:29:13.676
- there are many ways to edit. - That's right.

726
00:29:13.906 --> 00:29:15.836
I'm sorry, but this is boring.

727
00:29:15.836 --> 00:29:17.206
I agree.

728
00:29:17.545 --> 00:29:19.646
We thought there would be something else.

729
00:29:19.646 --> 00:29:21.815
- There's nothing else. - Viewers must be...

730
00:29:21.815 --> 00:29:23.446
changing the channel now.

731
00:29:23.446 --> 00:29:25.985
- The viewers will be bored. - Why do you show it for so long?

732
00:29:25.985 --> 00:29:28.356
- It's a little... - It's embarrassing.

733
00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:29.926
The viewership will decrease because of me.

734
00:29:29.926 --> 00:29:32.255
- Turn on the radio instead. - I want to see who wins.

735
00:29:32.255 --> 00:29:33.656
An hour remains.

736
00:29:34.525 --> 00:29:36.396
Is there an hour of his running?

737
00:29:36.596 --> 00:29:37.825
What's going on?

738
00:29:37.926 --> 00:29:39.896
Isn't this too ordinary?

739
00:29:40.366 --> 00:29:42.235
- By the way... - This is more interesting.

740
00:29:42.235 --> 00:29:44.235
This is fun.

741
00:29:44.465 --> 00:29:47.075
- This is fun. It's a bridge. - It's a show on Norway.

742
00:29:47.376 --> 00:29:48.706
There are trees.

743
00:29:48.975 --> 00:29:51.545
Jun Ha keeps running for now.

744
00:29:51.575 --> 00:29:54.446
- Let's take a look at someone else. - Why?

745
00:29:54.515 --> 00:29:56.386
What's Myeong Soo up to?

746
00:29:57.146 --> 00:29:58.946
It's so early in the morning.

747
00:29:59.456 --> 00:30:02.255
Where are we going that we have to leave so early?

748
00:30:03.126 --> 00:30:04.555
What are we doing today?

749
00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:07.055
(The staff remains quiet.)

750
00:30:08.126 --> 00:30:09.896
(You should tell me beforehand.)

751
00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:11.196
Do I get in?

752
00:30:14.196 --> 00:30:15.396
What's this?

753
00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:17.305
(He gets in the van on his own.)

754
00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:21.436
Where are we going?

755
00:30:22.606 --> 00:30:23.745
What could it be?

756
00:30:24.346 --> 00:30:25.606
I'm so curious.

757
00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:27.075
(He groans.)

758
00:30:28.315 --> 00:30:30.715
(It's still pitch dark outside.)

759
00:30:32.245 --> 00:30:35.515
(The van heads north.)

760
00:30:36.426 --> 00:30:38.156
(Snoring)

761
00:30:39.456 --> 00:30:41.926
- He's traveling far. - It was very far.

762
00:30:42.055 --> 00:30:45.465
We were on an unpaved road. Was I going to a construction site?

763
00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:49.636
(He arrives where Korean flags are everywhere.)

764
00:30:51.606 --> 00:30:52.636
(A light comes on.)

765
00:30:53.206 --> 00:30:54.706
(He's still fast asleep.)

766
00:30:56.406 --> 00:30:58.475
- Myeong Soo. - Yes?

767
00:30:58.475 --> 00:31:00.515
We're here. Please put on...

768
00:31:00.815 --> 00:31:03.215
the blindfold and headphones in front of you.

769
00:31:03.386 --> 00:31:04.616
Why?

770
00:31:05.815 --> 00:31:07.686
(I can't be bothered.)

771
00:31:10.985 --> 00:31:14.525
(Though he complains, he follows the order.)

772
00:31:14.525 --> 00:31:15.596
Yes.

773
00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:19.265
Please come out.

774
00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:23.565
(He's submissive.)

775
00:31:25.436 --> 00:31:30.176
(Is he heading towards barbed wires?)

776
00:31:31.575 --> 00:31:33.116
(Where is this place?)

777
00:31:34.275 --> 00:31:35.646
- What is it? - What's going on?

778
00:31:36.116 --> 00:31:37.386
(He gasps.)

779
00:31:37.386 --> 00:31:40.116
- Goodness. - Gosh, I had no idea.

780
00:31:41.186 --> 00:31:42.785
My goodness.

781
00:31:44.386 --> 00:31:47.856
(He enters without knowing what lies ahead.)

782
00:31:47.995 --> 00:31:50.265
- Gosh, I had no idea. - Goodness.

783
00:31:50.765 --> 00:31:51.965
My goodness.

784
00:31:51.965 --> 00:31:53.096
(He's at the military training ground.)

785
00:31:54.696 --> 00:31:56.735
(Everyone holds their breath.)

786
00:31:58.606 --> 00:31:59.975
Goodness.

787
00:32:00.005 --> 00:32:02.475
- It must have been hard. - He probably had no idea.

788
00:32:04.275 --> 00:32:05.906
I had no idea.

789
00:32:07.515 --> 00:32:11.146
(Everyone pays attention to the new soldier.)

790
00:32:12.245 --> 00:32:15.456
Myeong Soo, take off your blindfold.

791
00:32:22.795 --> 00:32:26.196
His reaction is completely real.

792
00:32:26.196 --> 00:32:28.696
I bet he couldn't believe it.

793
00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:32.206
(The best thing he did in 2017 was entering the military.)

794
00:32:32.206 --> 00:32:33.606
This is what he told the staff.

795
00:32:33.775 --> 00:32:35.735
(He often wore military wear.)

796
00:32:36.505 --> 00:32:38.475
(He enjoys the upturn.)

797
00:32:40.146 --> 00:32:42.715
(Wherever he was, he always longed for that place.)

798
00:32:43.515 --> 00:32:46.755
(It was always in his heart.)

799
00:32:46.886 --> 00:32:48.916
- Send Myeong Soo to the military. - Right.

800
00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:50.186
Victory.

801
00:32:50.686 --> 00:32:52.856
(Didn't you miss the military?)

802
00:32:54.295 --> 00:32:58.725
(If it's not too late, please accept this gift.)

803
00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:03.505
(He reenters the military.)

804
00:33:05.765 --> 00:33:08.836
(He's in front of what's been prepared for him.)

805
00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:12.815
(He feels out of place.)

806
00:33:14.616 --> 00:33:16.146
He's in a daze.

807
00:33:16.146 --> 00:33:17.686
He stands there for a long time.

808
00:33:17.686 --> 00:33:19.186
(Military unit that always wins)

809
00:33:19.186 --> 00:33:23.025
(Invincible Taepoong Unit)

810
00:33:23.985 --> 00:33:27.456
(Now he realizes the surprise prepared by the staff.)

811
00:33:29.866 --> 00:33:31.396
(He looks around.)

812
00:33:31.765 --> 00:33:34.436
- He's looking for the staff. - There was no one.

813
00:33:34.436 --> 00:33:36.366
- Absolutely no one. - He wants to...

814
00:33:36.366 --> 00:33:37.565
- talk to them. - Right.

815
00:33:37.565 --> 00:33:39.065
(There are only soldiers.)

816
00:33:39.706 --> 00:33:41.906
He's looking for the staff.

817
00:33:41.906 --> 00:33:44.146
(Where are you? Come out.)

818
00:33:44.446 --> 00:33:46.416
He's like a lost child looking for his mom.

819
00:33:47.475 --> 00:33:48.715
He's running away.

820
00:33:48.745 --> 00:33:49.785
(He runs away.)

821
00:33:51.785 --> 00:33:52.856
(Is he deserting the army?)

822
00:33:52.856 --> 00:33:54.215
He's deserting the unit.

823
00:33:55.416 --> 00:33:58.725
He's still wearing a jacket of military color.

824
00:33:58.725 --> 00:34:00.925
- He wears it often. - What's going on?

825
00:34:02.095 --> 00:34:04.396
Gosh, what do I have to do?

826
00:34:04.396 --> 00:34:06.135
(The farther he runs, the military gets closer.)

827
00:34:06.495 --> 00:34:07.896
I already...

828
00:34:08.695 --> 00:34:11.365
I already served in the military.

829
00:34:11.566 --> 00:34:12.975
He says that he already did.

830
00:34:13.106 --> 00:34:14.436
My goodness.

831
00:34:14.436 --> 00:34:15.635
(He tries to get out of it.)

832
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:18.845
(They hold him tightly.)

833
00:34:19.816 --> 00:34:21.345
(At the same time)

834
00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:25.546
(Another member arrives.)

835
00:34:27.385 --> 00:34:30.555
(The silhouette looks familiar.)

836
00:34:31.425 --> 00:34:33.256
(He turns around carefully.)

837
00:34:33.256 --> 00:34:34.725
What's going on?

838
00:34:35.725 --> 00:34:38.225
(Why is Sae Ho here?)

839
00:34:41.265 --> 00:34:43.066
(Before going to the military training)

840
00:34:43.066 --> 00:34:45.865
We're hoping that another member...

841
00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:47.805
- joins you. - Two of us?

842
00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:50.376
What are we doing that requires two people?

843
00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:52.146
Are we loading things?

844
00:34:53.876 --> 00:34:55.515
Jae Seok must be sleeping now.

845
00:34:56.316 --> 00:34:58.486
(Everyone must be sleeping at this hour.)

846
00:34:58.586 --> 00:35:00.055
He picked up.

847
00:35:00.086 --> 00:35:01.655
- Hello? - Why are you calling me?

848
00:35:01.655 --> 00:35:03.126
- Do you answer at 6am? - Jae Seok.

849
00:35:03.126 --> 00:35:05.626
- Myeong Soo. - I usually wake up at 7am.

850
00:35:05.655 --> 00:35:07.925
I need to get up and go now.

851
00:35:07.925 --> 00:35:09.225
Where are you going?

852
00:35:09.626 --> 00:35:11.765
We have a shoot today.

853
00:35:12.425 --> 00:35:13.466
Are you lying?

854
00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:15.535
No, I have to get up.

855
00:35:15.535 --> 00:35:17.405
Don't go back to sleep.

856
00:35:17.836 --> 00:35:20.405
- I won't. - Thank you. Talk to you soon.

857
00:35:20.675 --> 00:35:21.706
Okay.

858
00:35:21.706 --> 00:35:22.845
(He fails to invite Jae Seok.)

859
00:35:23.006 --> 00:35:24.345
Hello?

860
00:35:24.876 --> 00:35:26.615
- Hello? - Sae Ho.

861
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.015
Myeong Soo.

862
00:35:28.445 --> 00:35:30.216
- What are you doing? - Were you sick?

863
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.716
- I fell asleep not long ago. - I'm sleeping.

864
00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:35.486
Are you doing anything today?

865
00:35:37.325 --> 00:35:40.126
- Why do you ask? - I'm just asking.

866
00:35:40.126 --> 00:35:41.296
(Groaning)

867
00:35:41.296 --> 00:35:43.265
- What are you doing today? - What is he saying?

868
00:35:44.666 --> 00:35:46.535
I have no plans today.

869
00:35:46.535 --> 00:35:48.765
Go back to sleep for now.

870
00:35:49.095 --> 00:35:51.506
- Okay. - I'll call if something happens.

871
00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:54.706
Wait, what's going on?

872
00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:56.876
- Get some rest. - What are you saying?

873
00:35:56.876 --> 00:35:58.975
I had just fallen asleep.

874
00:35:58.975 --> 00:36:00.716
- Sae Ho is free. - I was half asleep.

875
00:36:00.716 --> 00:36:01.916
He didn't work yesterday either.

876
00:36:02.345 --> 00:36:05.716
You should leave first. We'll take Sae Ho...

877
00:36:06.015 --> 00:36:08.385
- to where you are. - Okay.

878
00:36:08.385 --> 00:36:10.055
Sae Ho seems free.

879
00:36:11.385 --> 00:36:14.396
(After receiving a call, he comes out.)

880
00:36:16.865 --> 00:36:18.195
His hair is up in the back.

881
00:36:18.725 --> 00:36:19.966
Seriously.

882
00:36:21.535 --> 00:36:23.305
(What's going on?)

883
00:36:23.305 --> 00:36:26.075
- Why did you come out? - They asked me to come downstairs.

884
00:36:26.276 --> 00:36:28.535
- I thought they had something. - Get in the car again?

885
00:36:30.776 --> 00:36:31.945
(What are you talking about?)

886
00:36:31.945 --> 00:36:34.316
- Goodness. - His reaction is hilarious.

887
00:36:34.316 --> 00:36:35.745
Where would I go at this hour?

888
00:36:35.745 --> 00:36:38.515
- I only slept for two hours. - It was...

889
00:36:40.816 --> 00:36:42.155
(He sees the car.)

890
00:36:43.626 --> 00:36:47.126
It feels exactly like last week.

891
00:36:48.296 --> 00:36:50.126
Do I get in this car again?

892
00:36:51.595 --> 00:36:52.995
(He slides the door.)

893
00:36:55.436 --> 00:36:58.166
(You know what this is, right?)

894
00:36:59.106 --> 00:37:00.405
- Are we going together? - I bet...

895
00:37:00.405 --> 00:37:03.206
he couldn't believe it.

896
00:37:04.175 --> 00:37:06.416
(He does what needs to be done.)

897
00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:08.975
I got tricked again.

898
00:37:10.986 --> 00:37:12.916
(His belly pops out.)

899
00:37:13.285 --> 00:37:15.856
- My goodness. - My body doesn't look good.

900
00:37:17.456 --> 00:37:18.885
(Am I here?)

901
00:37:18.885 --> 00:37:20.396
- Sae Ho. - Yes?

902
00:37:20.956 --> 00:37:22.595
- Put on the blindfold... - Am I putting the blindfold...

903
00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:24.225
- and the headphones on again? - He's done it once.

904
00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:25.626
You're fluent at this now.

905
00:37:25.626 --> 00:37:26.995
Yes, since I've done it once.

906
00:37:26.995 --> 00:37:28.035
I'm ready.

907
00:37:29.566 --> 00:37:30.666
It's cold.

908
00:37:30.936 --> 00:37:32.436
I feel so sorry for him.

909
00:37:32.436 --> 00:37:34.475
I have my pajamas on.

910
00:37:34.475 --> 00:37:36.006
(He's ready to go in his pajamas.)

911
00:37:36.006 --> 00:37:37.106
(He looks polite.)

912
00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:39.675
What do I do? What's this?

913
00:37:39.675 --> 00:37:41.345
(They just passed each other.)

914
00:37:42.245 --> 00:37:44.216
(That's how these two met.)

915
00:37:45.845 --> 00:37:47.856
(He got unlucky.)

916
00:37:51.586 --> 00:37:53.725
- Do I take this off? - Please take your blindfold off.

917
00:37:55.026 --> 00:37:56.126
(Peaking)

918
00:37:57.166 --> 00:37:58.396
Attention.

919
00:37:58.695 --> 00:37:59.836
(What's all this?)

920
00:37:59.836 --> 00:38:01.865
- Why is he so ugly? - Attention.

921
00:38:02.265 --> 00:38:04.336
- He's so ugly. - What are we supposed to do?

922
00:38:04.535 --> 00:38:05.966
What are they doing there?

923
00:38:05.966 --> 00:38:07.936
(Welcome to Taepoong Unit.)

924
00:38:08.776 --> 00:38:10.405
(Myeong Soo?)

925
00:38:10.405 --> 00:38:11.575
(Myeong Soo avoids him.)

926
00:38:13.046 --> 00:38:14.175
Order arms.

927
00:38:14.175 --> 00:38:15.345
(Is this...)

928
00:38:15.345 --> 00:38:17.186
(a dream?)

929
00:38:17.186 --> 00:38:18.515
- We report today... - We report today...

930
00:38:18.515 --> 00:38:20.486
(He's ashamed.)

931
00:38:20.515 --> 00:38:23.155
They so look like two comedians.

932
00:38:23.155 --> 00:38:24.425
(It looks like a comedy show.)

933
00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:26.456
Order arms.

934
00:38:26.456 --> 00:38:27.796
Myeong Soo and Sae Ho,

935
00:38:27.825 --> 00:38:31.195
you have entered the training camp on January 17 at 9am.

936
00:38:31.195 --> 00:38:32.695
It's an hour before leaving for advanced training.

937
00:38:32.695 --> 00:38:34.466
An hour before advanced training?

938
00:38:35.296 --> 00:38:36.966
Please stand in a row.

939
00:38:36.966 --> 00:38:38.135
(Private Cho Sae Ho and Park Myeong Soo)

940
00:38:40.106 --> 00:38:47.146
(They get assigned to the 28th Infantry Division.)

941
00:38:47.146 --> 00:38:49.716
(1 Hour Before)

942
00:38:49.716 --> 00:38:50.716
Forward, march.

943
00:38:52.646 --> 00:38:55.086
(His body responds to the command.)

944
00:38:55.916 --> 00:38:58.686
- Three - Why are we here, Myeong Soo?

945
00:38:59.695 --> 00:39:03.325
The training might be tough if Myeong Soo comes alone.

946
00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:08.265
We train in a group, so you need somebody next to you.

947
00:39:08.265 --> 00:39:10.436
That's why Sae Ho joined.

948
00:39:10.436 --> 00:39:11.606
It'll be a good idea.

949
00:39:12.466 --> 00:39:13.805
(The two of us?)

950
00:39:14.836 --> 00:39:16.305
We're in trouble.

951
00:39:16.305 --> 00:39:17.876
Don't talk while we move.

952
00:39:18.575 --> 00:39:19.745
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

953
00:39:21.916 --> 00:39:24.515
(They confidently enter the dormitory.)

954
00:39:26.015 --> 00:39:27.515
(Groaning)

955
00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:30.425
(This looks familiar.)

956
00:39:30.425 --> 00:39:32.756
It hasn't changed at all.

957
00:39:33.356 --> 00:39:34.995
You'll be reporting to the battalion commander,

958
00:39:34.995 --> 00:39:38.425
so change into the combat uniform and the windbreakers in your locker,

959
00:39:38.425 --> 00:39:39.796
and stand by in the dormitory.

960
00:39:39.836 --> 00:39:41.035
Yes, sir. Proceed.

961
00:39:41.035 --> 00:39:42.066
Proceed.

962
00:39:42.635 --> 00:39:43.635
(Sighing)

963
00:39:44.706 --> 00:39:45.736
(You know what?)

964
00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:47.805
- Myeong Soo. - What do I do? I already forgot.

965
00:39:47.805 --> 00:39:49.606
Is it just the two of us?

966
00:39:49.606 --> 00:39:50.646
Yes.

967
00:39:51.675 --> 00:39:53.245
(So why is it the two of us?)

968
00:39:53.416 --> 00:39:54.845
Get changed quickly.

969
00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:57.445
I can't believe I'm doing this.

970
00:39:57.445 --> 00:39:59.015
(They forget about how confused they are...)

971
00:40:00.186 --> 00:40:02.986
(and get changed quickly.)

972
00:40:04.155 --> 00:40:05.356
(Please...)

973
00:40:05.725 --> 00:40:09.325
That uniform belongs to Myeong Soo.

974
00:40:09.666 --> 00:40:12.026
(They leave to report to the battalion commander.)

975
00:40:13.466 --> 00:40:14.635
Here we go.

976
00:40:15.265 --> 00:40:16.836
March time, march.

977
00:40:17.236 --> 00:40:19.365
- Halt. - 1, 2.

978
00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:21.876
You're going to practice saying the transfer report.

979
00:40:21.975 --> 00:40:24.876
Myeong Soo has to say...

980
00:40:25.445 --> 00:40:27.646
the following. Memorize the following...

981
00:40:28.316 --> 00:40:30.186
- and report. - He's doing that again?

982
00:40:31.186 --> 00:40:32.216
Yes, sir.

983
00:40:33.356 --> 00:40:34.356
(He wasn't there at the last military special.)

984
00:40:34.356 --> 00:40:36.526
"I report. Private Park Myeong Soo."

985
00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:39.126
- "And Cho Sae Ho." - And Cho Sae Ho.

986
00:40:39.126 --> 00:40:41.825
"On January 17, 2018,"

987
00:40:41.825 --> 00:40:43.825
"we have been transferred to the 28th Infantry Division."

988
00:40:43.825 --> 00:40:45.966
"I report. Salute to the battalion commander."

989
00:40:45.995 --> 00:40:48.666
You'll say it yourself. Can you do it?

990
00:40:50.066 --> 00:40:51.905
(Sighing)

991
00:40:52.506 --> 00:40:53.635
Can you do it?

992
00:40:53.635 --> 00:40:55.075
(He lets out a deep sigh.)

993
00:40:56.006 --> 00:40:58.175
I made many mistakes last time.

994
00:40:58.175 --> 00:40:59.876
(He recollects the trauma.)

995
00:41:00.816 --> 00:41:03.416
(He did the transfer report at the last training ground.)

996
00:41:05.586 --> 00:41:06.586
(Creaking)

997
00:41:07.615 --> 00:41:09.526
(Park Myeong Soo and 6 others...)

998
00:41:09.655 --> 00:41:11.186
(6 people)

999
00:41:12.285 --> 00:41:13.725
(When he gets nervous, he can't speak.)

1000
00:41:13.725 --> 00:41:14.796
I mean...

1001
00:41:15.555 --> 00:41:16.566
Goodness.

1002
00:41:17.026 --> 00:41:19.325
(For him, this is worse than having hepatitis A.)

1003
00:41:19.325 --> 00:41:20.695
That was too real.

1004
00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:22.166
(Dazed)

1005
00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:24.535
- I think I need to practice. - You have 10 minutes.

1006
00:41:24.535 --> 00:41:25.535
Yes, sir.

1007
00:41:25.736 --> 00:41:27.706
- Make mistakes right away. - Battalion commander...

1008
00:41:27.836 --> 00:41:29.445
Salute to the battalion commander.

1009
00:41:29.805 --> 00:41:31.646
- Salute. - Victory. I mean...

1010
00:41:32.106 --> 00:41:35.575
We have entered the 28th Infantry Division...

1011
00:41:35.575 --> 00:41:37.216
"We have been transferred to the 28th Infantry Division."

1012
00:41:37.216 --> 00:41:39.986
- I report. - We've been transferred. I report.

1013
00:41:39.986 --> 00:41:41.655
- Do you want to do it? - No.

1014
00:41:41.816 --> 00:41:42.885
Do it.

1015
00:41:43.555 --> 00:41:44.626
The senior has to do it.

1016
00:41:45.186 --> 00:41:46.256
I'm the senior?

1017
00:41:46.256 --> 00:41:47.456
- You came first. - I see.

1018
00:41:47.456 --> 00:41:50.825
Amongst peers, it's alphabetical order and who came first.

1019
00:41:50.825 --> 00:41:51.925
Yes, sir.

1020
00:41:52.526 --> 00:41:54.336
On January 17, 2018,

1021
00:41:55.296 --> 00:41:57.035
we have been moved...

1022
00:41:58.006 --> 00:41:59.006
to the 28th Infantry Division.

1023
00:42:00.175 --> 00:42:01.405
"I report."

1024
00:42:01.776 --> 00:42:02.945
Stop it.

1025
00:42:06.316 --> 00:42:08.316
I report. Private Park Myeong Soo.

1026
00:42:08.316 --> 00:42:09.486
And Cho Sae Ho.

1027
00:42:09.816 --> 00:42:12.416
- Us 2... - 2 people.

1028
00:42:12.416 --> 00:42:13.615
- It's "2 people"? - Yes.

1029
00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:15.756
We have been transferred...

1030
00:42:16.015 --> 00:42:17.486
to the 28th Infantry Division.

1031
00:42:18.225 --> 00:42:21.055
Battalion commander...

1032
00:42:21.055 --> 00:42:22.225
(His tongue moves too fast.)

1033
00:42:23.195 --> 00:42:24.325
Battalion commander...

1034
00:42:24.325 --> 00:42:26.195
I can't say it. I keep stuttering.

1035
00:42:26.736 --> 00:42:28.236
Battalion commander...

1036
00:42:29.436 --> 00:42:31.236
Battalion commander...

1037
00:42:31.936 --> 00:42:33.975
Battalion commander. Battalion commander.

1038
00:42:33.975 --> 00:42:35.276
Why are you trying to teach me?

1039
00:42:35.376 --> 00:42:37.506
You can't stutter like that.

1040
00:42:37.506 --> 00:42:39.646
- Battalion commander. - Stop it.

1041
00:42:40.115 --> 00:42:41.845
- So... - Battalion commander.

1042
00:42:42.046 --> 00:42:44.115
- Battalion... - Battalion commander.

1043
00:42:44.316 --> 00:42:45.615
- Battalion commander. - Battalion...

1044
00:42:45.945 --> 00:42:46.956
Battalion commander...

1045
00:42:47.686 --> 00:42:49.425
Battalion commander... Gosh.

1046
00:42:50.486 --> 00:42:51.655
You can do it.

1047
00:42:52.586 --> 00:42:53.595
Here comes the battalion commander.

1048
00:42:54.126 --> 00:42:55.325
Here he is.

1049
00:42:55.325 --> 00:42:57.566
It's been so long. I got nervous.

1050
00:42:57.566 --> 00:43:00.095
- Of course. - I remember.

1051
00:43:01.365 --> 00:43:04.035
(Will these two Privates be fine?)

1052
00:43:04.035 --> 00:43:06.336
There will be a transfer report by the Privates.

1053
00:43:06.475 --> 00:43:08.675
Report.

1054
00:43:09.876 --> 00:43:12.606
Salute to...

1055
00:43:12.606 --> 00:43:14.316
(He makes the same mistake again.)

1056
00:43:14.615 --> 00:43:15.615
Again.

1057
00:43:15.615 --> 00:43:17.146
(He makes a mistake 5 seconds in.)

1058
00:43:18.115 --> 00:43:19.115
(Lieutenant Colonel Choi Seok Geun)

1059
00:43:19.615 --> 00:43:20.615
Again.

1060
00:43:21.316 --> 00:43:24.026
Salute to the battalion commander.

1061
00:43:24.356 --> 00:43:25.626
- Salute. - Salute.

1062
00:43:26.225 --> 00:43:27.296
Salute.

1063
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:29.425
As you were.

1064
00:43:30.526 --> 00:43:33.436
I report. Private Park Myeong Soo.

1065
00:43:33.436 --> 00:43:34.936
And Cho Sae Ho.

1066
00:43:35.236 --> 00:43:37.635
Us 2...

1067
00:43:37.635 --> 00:43:40.006
(He makes the number mistake again.)

1068
00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:42.035
What is he saying?

1069
00:43:42.376 --> 00:43:43.546
I...

1070
00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:44.606
Again.

1071
00:43:45.805 --> 00:43:46.876
(Glancing)

1072
00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:50.816
I report. Private Park Myeong Soo.

1073
00:43:50.816 --> 00:43:52.316
And Cho Sae Ho.

1074
00:43:52.716 --> 00:43:56.626
On January 17, 2018...

1075
00:43:56.626 --> 00:43:57.686
(However,)

1076
00:43:57.686 --> 00:43:58.825
(he pauses again.)

1077
00:43:58.825 --> 00:43:59.825
I...

1078
00:44:00.126 --> 00:44:01.626
(The personnel officer helps out.)

1079
00:44:01.626 --> 00:44:04.865
We have been transferred to the 28th Infantry Division.

1080
00:44:04.925 --> 00:44:06.296
I report.

1081
00:44:06.836 --> 00:44:09.506
Salute to the battalion commander.

1082
00:44:09.936 --> 00:44:11.166
- Salute. - Salute.

1083
00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:12.265
(The transfer report is done.)

1084
00:44:12.265 --> 00:44:13.336
Salute.

1085
00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:14.836
As you were.

1086
00:44:15.706 --> 00:44:18.075
Private Park Myeong Soo and Cho Sae Ho,

1087
00:44:18.245 --> 00:44:21.015
welcome to Taepoong Unit.

1088
00:44:21.515 --> 00:44:23.015
As you know,

1089
00:44:23.245 --> 00:44:27.256
we confront the enemies in the front lines.

1090
00:44:27.256 --> 00:44:28.586
- We must be ready... - They're in the front lines.

1091
00:44:28.586 --> 00:44:31.126
to fight and defeat the enemies at all times,

1092
00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:35.595
so we conduct physical training at an advanced level.

1093
00:44:35.595 --> 00:44:38.095
I hope you become the best soldier...

1094
00:44:38.095 --> 00:44:41.836
in Taepoong Unit, the best force in the country.

1095
00:44:41.995 --> 00:44:43.006
Private Park Myeong Soo.

1096
00:44:43.206 --> 00:44:44.936
Yes, Private Park Myeong Soo.

1097
00:44:45.066 --> 00:44:46.606
Let me hear your determination.

1098
00:44:46.706 --> 00:44:48.135
As a member of Taepoong Unit,

1099
00:44:48.635 --> 00:44:49.745
I hope to...

1100
00:44:49.876 --> 00:44:51.075
blow the enemies...

1101
00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:53.515
"I hope to blow the enemies."

1102
00:44:54.716 --> 00:44:56.316
And become...

1103
00:44:57.086 --> 00:44:58.986
an excellent soldier.

1104
00:44:59.186 --> 00:45:01.316
I am very reassured.

1105
00:45:01.316 --> 00:45:02.925
Yes, sir. Thank you.

1106
00:45:03.586 --> 00:45:05.856
- Private Cho Sae Ho. - As long as I'm in this unit,

1107
00:45:06.825 --> 00:45:09.825
I'll consider my body as the typhoon.

1108
00:45:10.296 --> 00:45:11.825
My body is the typhoon.

1109
00:45:11.825 --> 00:45:12.836
What does he mean?

1110
00:45:12.836 --> 00:45:14.466
Why is your body the typhoon?

1111
00:45:14.695 --> 00:45:17.006
- Why? - I'm going to sweep everything.

1112
00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.466
That was too funny.

1113
00:45:19.236 --> 00:45:20.635
Salute to the battalion commander.

1114
00:45:21.336 --> 00:45:24.075
- Salute. - Salute... Hey.

1115
00:45:24.245 --> 00:45:25.675
- Salute. - Again.

1116
00:45:27.115 --> 00:45:29.276
Salute to the battalion commander.

1117
00:45:29.816 --> 00:45:30.816
- Salute. - Salute.

1118
00:45:31.245 --> 00:45:32.245
Salute.

1119
00:45:33.115 --> 00:45:34.155
As you were.

1120
00:45:35.615 --> 00:45:37.385
(The battalion commander leaves.)

1121
00:45:37.986 --> 00:45:39.695
Why did you speak before me?

1122
00:45:39.756 --> 00:45:40.956
He told us... Okay.

1123
00:45:41.225 --> 00:45:42.225
(He's unhappy.)

1124
00:45:43.626 --> 00:45:44.796
(They don't work as a team.)

1125
00:45:45.066 --> 00:45:46.836
You're going back in. To the left in line.

1126
00:45:47.466 --> 00:45:48.535
To the left in line.

1127
00:45:49.635 --> 00:45:50.905
(Fumbling)

1128
00:45:50.905 --> 00:45:52.706
- As you were. Halt. - Sae Ho is not listening.

1129
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:54.175
To the left in line.

1130
00:45:54.175 --> 00:45:56.245
You'll move left in a row, okay?

1131
00:45:57.075 --> 00:45:59.575
(It means to move next to each other.)

1132
00:46:00.716 --> 00:46:01.975
To the left in line.

1133
00:46:03.146 --> 00:46:04.216
Again.

1134
00:46:05.716 --> 00:46:07.456
Isn't it like this?

1135
00:46:08.756 --> 00:46:09.825
Isn't this it?

1136
00:46:09.825 --> 00:46:12.856
You'll move together as you advance.

1137
00:46:12.956 --> 00:46:14.856
- To the left in line. - 1, 2.

1138
00:46:14.925 --> 00:46:15.925
(Will they succeed this time?)

1139
00:46:15.925 --> 00:46:17.195
(Hesitating)

1140
00:46:18.296 --> 00:46:20.066
(Are you doing a tap dance?)

1141
00:46:20.836 --> 00:46:21.836
(They're confused.)

1142
00:46:21.836 --> 00:46:23.566
- Go. Quick. - Was that right?

1143
00:46:26.236 --> 00:46:28.206
- Are they "Dumb and Dumber"? - It's been a while.

1144
00:46:28.836 --> 00:46:30.405
Do they have a combined IQ of 100?

1145
00:46:31.475 --> 00:46:32.845
This is killing me.

1146
00:46:33.216 --> 00:46:35.845
- Don't talk while you move. - Yes, sir.

1147
00:46:36.646 --> 00:46:39.686
I wonder how Jun Ha is doing.

1148
00:46:39.686 --> 00:46:40.816
He's running, right?

1149
00:46:40.816 --> 00:46:42.186
Is he still running?

1150
00:46:42.856 --> 00:46:44.086
(What else would he be doing?)

1151
00:46:44.086 --> 00:46:45.385
- Good luck. - He's running.

1152
00:46:45.526 --> 00:46:46.526
Thank you.

1153
00:46:47.756 --> 00:46:49.356
- Good luck. - Thank you.

1154
00:46:50.765 --> 00:46:51.865
He's still running.

1155
00:46:51.925 --> 00:46:53.796
- Good luck. - Thank you.

1156
00:46:53.865 --> 00:46:55.635
I don't know how many times people said that.

1157
00:46:56.265 --> 00:46:57.535
- Good luck. - You too.

1158
00:46:57.535 --> 00:46:59.336
Are people saying "good luck" already?

1159
00:46:59.635 --> 00:47:01.506
I'm going to be saying "good luck" the entire time.

1160
00:47:02.405 --> 00:47:05.075
- You know exactly. - I'm almost there.

1161
00:47:06.245 --> 00:47:08.876
(Myeong Soo and Sae Ho are back in the dormitory.)

1162
00:47:11.146 --> 00:47:14.686
(The atmosphere here doesn't seem good.)

1163
00:47:15.885 --> 00:47:18.456
(There's a newbie?)

1164
00:47:19.155 --> 00:47:20.725
Stand in front of your lockers.

1165
00:47:21.055 --> 00:47:22.155
Yes, sir!

1166
00:47:25.126 --> 00:47:26.265
(They're nervous.)

1167
00:47:26.265 --> 00:47:27.896
He's really charismatic.

1168
00:47:28.966 --> 00:47:29.966
(The vibe is different from the training field's.)

1169
00:47:29.966 --> 00:47:31.765
- Attention. - Attention.

1170
00:47:31.765 --> 00:47:33.535
There is a newbie who just joined us.

1171
00:47:33.535 --> 00:47:35.805
The seniors should take good care of him. Do you understand?

1172
00:47:35.805 --> 00:47:38.675
Private Cho Sae Ho and Park Myeong Soo, take off your berets.

1173
00:47:39.975 --> 00:47:41.115
Bald?

1174
00:47:41.845 --> 00:47:43.115
Take off your berets right now.

1175
00:47:43.445 --> 00:47:44.615
Yes, sir!

1176
00:47:45.345 --> 00:47:47.416
It must have been really small.

1177
00:47:47.655 --> 00:47:49.686
- The beret was small for you. - Right.

1178
00:47:49.686 --> 00:47:53.456
Introduce yourselves shortly after the new private's introduction.

1179
00:47:53.456 --> 00:47:54.995
- Do you understand? - Yes, sir!

1180
00:47:56.195 --> 00:47:58.095
I'm Lee Jeong Min, a corporal and a squad commander...

1181
00:47:58.095 --> 00:47:59.995
for the third squad.

1182
00:48:00.265 --> 00:48:03.506
Today, Private Cho Sae Ho will be the new squad commander.

1183
00:48:03.836 --> 00:48:05.506
Make sure you all obey his orders.

1184
00:48:05.805 --> 00:48:07.135
Yes, sir.

1185
00:48:09.276 --> 00:48:11.106
I'm Lee Yoon Jin. I'm a private.

1186
00:48:11.106 --> 00:48:13.146
I'm the youngest here.

1187
00:48:13.146 --> 00:48:15.276
- You're the youngest? - He's the youngest?

1188
00:48:15.276 --> 00:48:17.186
- He joined last October. - Nice to meet you.

1189
00:48:19.345 --> 00:48:20.856
Private Park Myeong Soo, come up to the front.

1190
00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:22.615
Tell everyone your resolutions and ambitions.

1191
00:48:22.615 --> 00:48:23.925
(Introduction time for the new privates)

1192
00:48:28.055 --> 00:48:29.595
I'm Park Myeong Soo, a private.

1193
00:48:29.595 --> 00:48:32.026
(I'll speak casually too.)

1194
00:48:32.026 --> 00:48:33.135
(Glaring)

1195
00:48:33.535 --> 00:48:35.035
(No, he can't do this.)

1196
00:48:36.135 --> 00:48:38.405
What is he doing?

1197
00:48:39.506 --> 00:48:41.075
What did you do there?

1198
00:48:41.075 --> 00:48:42.745
I thought everyone does it this way.

1199
00:48:42.745 --> 00:48:45.445
"I'm Park Myeong Soo, a private."

1200
00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:47.945
I don't know. That's how the seniors said it.

1201
00:48:48.245 --> 00:48:49.486
Why didn't you wave at them as well?

1202
00:48:49.586 --> 00:48:51.086
I'm Park Myeong Soo, a private.

1203
00:48:51.086 --> 00:48:53.216
(Hi, seniors.)

1204
00:48:54.256 --> 00:48:55.916
I'm Park Myeong Soo, a private.

1205
00:48:56.885 --> 00:48:57.986
Today...

1206
00:48:57.986 --> 00:48:58.986
(Flinching)

1207
00:48:59.325 --> 00:49:03.825
I'll do my best. I won't put you all in trouble.

1208
00:49:04.126 --> 00:49:07.365
I'll be a nice private for you all.

1209
00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:08.836
If you could teach me,

1210
00:49:09.535 --> 00:49:11.006
I'll do my best to follow you.

1211
00:49:11.466 --> 00:49:12.635
Salute!

1212
00:49:13.006 --> 00:49:14.106
Give him a round of applause!

1213
00:49:14.106 --> 00:49:16.606
(He found his sense back while introducing himself.)

1214
00:49:18.345 --> 00:49:19.975
- Private Cho Sae Ho, come up now. - Yes, sir.

1215
00:49:19.975 --> 00:49:21.916
Share your resolutions and ambitions.

1216
00:49:25.115 --> 00:49:27.356
I didn't realize I was here until I came to my senses.

1217
00:49:28.155 --> 00:49:29.285
(He can't concentrate.)

1218
00:49:29.655 --> 00:49:31.925
However, since I'm here,

1219
00:49:32.155 --> 00:49:34.055
I'll do my best to prove myself through actions.

1220
00:49:34.456 --> 00:49:35.695
Salute!

1221
00:49:35.695 --> 00:49:36.725
(The seniors like his loud voice.)

1222
00:49:38.566 --> 00:49:40.365
(He's regretting how he introduced himself rudely in the beginning.)

1223
00:49:40.436 --> 00:49:41.936
- Get back to your seat. - Yes, sir.

1224
00:49:43.006 --> 00:49:45.106
Get ready to do physical training.

1225
00:49:45.106 --> 00:49:46.135
That's it for now.

1226
00:49:48.035 --> 00:49:49.236
(The first step to be a combatant)

1227
00:49:49.845 --> 00:49:50.945
(Physical training based on circulations)

1228
00:49:51.146 --> 00:49:54.115
Move to the push up places. First group, move.

1229
00:49:54.276 --> 00:49:55.445
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

1230
00:49:55.975 --> 00:49:58.216
Do the push up for two minutes.

1231
00:49:58.486 --> 00:49:59.916
Get ready!

1232
00:50:02.055 --> 00:50:03.256
Ready, start.

1233
00:50:06.325 --> 00:50:07.595
Count louder!

1234
00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:11.725
(They're getting worried more and more as they watch them.)

1235
00:50:12.365 --> 00:50:13.566
Lift your backs too.

1236
00:50:14.265 --> 00:50:15.995
It's like a scene from movies.

1237
00:50:16.106 --> 00:50:17.736
- It looks like a movie scene. - Yes, it does.

1238
00:50:19.236 --> 00:50:22.206
80, 82, 77.

1239
00:50:22.206 --> 00:50:23.646
- 103. - 103, okay.

1240
00:50:24.506 --> 00:50:26.146
(Oh, my goodness.)

1241
00:50:27.615 --> 00:50:29.075
(His soul is gone.)

1242
00:50:29.745 --> 00:50:30.816
Now, it's the second group's turn.

1243
00:50:30.816 --> 00:50:33.216
1st group, move to the back of the 4th team.

1244
00:50:33.216 --> 00:50:35.115
(It's finally Myeong Soo and Sae Ho's turn.)

1245
00:50:35.555 --> 00:50:37.225
- Get ready for the push up. - Ready!

1246
00:50:37.225 --> 00:50:38.825
Put your chest on the bar.

1247
00:50:38.825 --> 00:50:40.356
They put it on the bar.

1248
00:50:41.126 --> 00:50:42.396
Ready, start.

1249
00:50:43.595 --> 00:50:45.896
(Their speed is obviously slower compared to the others.)

1250
00:50:47.796 --> 00:50:49.706
(They are slow from the beginning.)

1251
00:50:50.966 --> 00:50:53.006
(Gosh.)

1252
00:50:53.135 --> 00:50:54.975
Private Cho Sae Ho. Lift your arms fully.

1253
00:50:55.206 --> 00:50:56.376
Yes, sir!

1254
00:50:57.376 --> 00:50:58.975
(It's like hitting the button with his belly.)

1255
00:50:58.975 --> 00:51:01.575
Look at their push ups and count properly.

1256
00:51:04.416 --> 00:51:05.885
They're not fit at all.

1257
00:51:06.916 --> 00:51:09.155
(Distorting his face)

1258
00:51:09.655 --> 00:51:11.225
(What are you doing?)

1259
00:51:12.456 --> 00:51:15.155
(The seniors are fine.)

1260
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.566
(The new privates are about to die.)

1261
00:51:18.796 --> 00:51:21.296
(I can do this!)

1262
00:51:21.296 --> 00:51:23.436
He talks so much, and he is so loud.

1263
00:51:25.635 --> 00:51:27.776
- Private Cho, keep it low. - Yes, sir!

1264
00:51:27.776 --> 00:51:29.106
(It's getting on my nerve.)

1265
00:51:30.876 --> 00:51:33.015
(Myeong Soo wails.)

1266
00:51:34.075 --> 00:51:35.376
(Screaming)

1267
00:51:36.146 --> 00:51:38.745
(The new privates' physical strength is like a sink hole.)

1268
00:51:40.385 --> 00:51:42.155
Do your best even for a single push up.

1269
00:51:42.155 --> 00:51:43.225
Yes, sir!

1270
00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:44.526
What is that?

1271
00:51:44.526 --> 00:51:45.956
(He's crying.)

1272
00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:48.555
Gosh, what a scene.

1273
00:51:48.555 --> 00:51:49.725
(He screams out loudly.)

1274
00:51:52.666 --> 00:51:55.765
(His voice from head is realized here in the army base.)

1275
00:51:56.436 --> 00:51:58.466
(He might improve his singing skill here.)

1276
00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:02.106
It's really embarrassing.

1277
00:52:02.206 --> 00:52:04.975
- What is he doing? - That's not training.

1278
00:52:05.046 --> 00:52:06.745
What are they doing?

1279
00:52:07.445 --> 00:52:11.486
(He would rather not see it.)

1280
00:52:15.586 --> 00:52:16.655
Two minutes are over.

1281
00:52:16.885 --> 00:52:18.026
Get up.

1282
00:52:18.526 --> 00:52:19.695
He's done 89.

1283
00:52:19.695 --> 00:52:21.256
- He's done 99. - 99.

1284
00:52:21.256 --> 00:52:23.095
- He's done 23. - 23.

1285
00:52:23.095 --> 00:52:24.966
- He's done 24. - 24.

1286
00:52:24.966 --> 00:52:28.066
I did more push ups than Sae Ho.

1287
00:52:28.236 --> 00:52:30.706
- We both didn't do well. - He only did 23?

1288
00:52:32.905 --> 00:52:34.336
You seriously have to work out.

1289
00:52:34.336 --> 00:52:36.276
- It's a sit-up now. - Start!

1290
00:52:36.276 --> 00:52:38.945
(Next training is sit-up.)

1291
00:52:39.816 --> 00:52:40.845
(The training to be a combatant continues!)

1292
00:52:40.845 --> 00:52:42.015
Sae Ho does it well.

1293
00:52:42.885 --> 00:52:43.986
But his moves are...

1294
00:52:44.216 --> 00:52:45.416
I got a cramp.

1295
00:52:45.416 --> 00:52:48.816
(Their crying continues.)

1296
00:52:49.756 --> 00:52:51.885
(All sorts of sounds from their bodies are heard.)

1297
00:52:51.885 --> 00:52:54.796
(All sounds that a body can make are heard.)

1298
00:52:54.796 --> 00:52:56.166
It's been 20 seconds.

1299
00:52:56.666 --> 00:52:59.695
(It's a tire pulling training now.)

1300
00:53:01.035 --> 00:53:03.606
- That training... - That training is the worst.

1301
00:53:04.006 --> 00:53:05.436
- Goodness. - It was way too tiring.

1302
00:53:05.436 --> 00:53:07.175
Ready, set,

1303
00:53:07.175 --> 00:53:08.206
start!

1304
00:53:09.575 --> 00:53:10.606
(He's running!)

1305
00:53:10.606 --> 00:53:12.245
I didn't give up though.

1306
00:53:12.245 --> 00:53:13.916
His tire isn't moving.

1307
00:53:14.276 --> 00:53:15.945
Sae Ho is strong though.

1308
00:53:15.945 --> 00:53:17.515
- Sae Ho is good. - He's fast!

1309
00:53:17.615 --> 00:53:18.745
- Goodness. - Gosh, he's good.

1310
00:53:19.046 --> 00:53:20.756
I couldn't see what was going on next to me.

1311
00:53:21.285 --> 00:53:22.956
- He's fast. - He's good.

1312
00:53:22.956 --> 00:53:24.885
(Their speeds are contrary from the beginning.)

1313
00:53:26.026 --> 00:53:27.425
(After passing the halfway point...)

1314
00:53:27.425 --> 00:53:28.856
- Is he running? - Yes.

1315
00:53:29.296 --> 00:53:30.966
It was so tiring to come back.

1316
00:53:32.595 --> 00:53:34.865
(His strength is all gone after the spurt from the beginning.)

1317
00:53:34.865 --> 00:53:36.805
(He's about to die.)

1318
00:53:37.236 --> 00:53:38.535
Let's do it!

1319
00:53:38.706 --> 00:53:39.905
I got this!

1320
00:53:40.635 --> 00:53:43.006
(Only his answer is at the speed of 200km per second.)

1321
00:53:44.506 --> 00:53:46.546
(They're crawling.)

1322
00:53:47.376 --> 00:53:50.345
(But they've finished the races.)

1323
00:53:50.345 --> 00:53:51.445
Private Park Myeong Soo, come this way.

1324
00:53:51.745 --> 00:53:53.015
(Their muscles are formed in just 1 hour.)

1325
00:53:56.155 --> 00:53:57.285
(Their kicks show how frustrated they are.)

1326
00:53:57.285 --> 00:53:58.356
He's good.

1327
00:53:59.456 --> 00:54:01.195
Right after this training,

1328
00:54:01.195 --> 00:54:03.066
- all my strength was gone. - Of course.

1329
00:54:03.296 --> 00:54:05.995
(The physical training is over.)

1330
00:54:06.365 --> 00:54:08.666
We're done with the physical training.

1331
00:54:08.666 --> 00:54:10.135
Wait for me at your dorms. Got it?

1332
00:54:10.135 --> 00:54:12.006
- Yes, sir! - Good job, everyone.

1333
00:54:12.006 --> 00:54:13.675
- Good job. - Good job!

1334
00:54:13.675 --> 00:54:15.035
Go and rest now.

1335
00:54:15.035 --> 00:54:16.106
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir!

1336
00:54:17.945 --> 00:54:20.615
What is Taepoong Unit like?

1337
00:54:21.146 --> 00:54:22.345
We're at the very front line.

1338
00:54:22.345 --> 00:54:24.146
- Is this the front line? - Yes.

1339
00:54:24.245 --> 00:54:26.256
- Is this the front line? - We're above Kaesong.

1340
00:54:26.816 --> 00:54:27.916
Kaesong?

1341
00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:29.186
(Is this some military joke?)

1342
00:54:29.885 --> 00:54:31.986
We're very close to North Korea.

1343
00:54:31.986 --> 00:54:34.126
There's GOP in about 10km from here.

1344
00:54:34.495 --> 00:54:37.225
Are there mines nearby?

1345
00:54:37.225 --> 00:54:39.495
Of course, there are.

1346
00:54:39.836 --> 00:54:41.195
Gosh. Isn't it dangerous?

1347
00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:43.805
If you follow instructions and orders, it's not that dangerous.

1348
00:54:44.135 --> 00:54:50.046
Get ready to move now!

1349
00:54:50.046 --> 00:54:51.745
(What is this?)

1350
00:54:52.745 --> 00:54:54.546
(Emergency siren is on.)

1351
00:54:54.776 --> 00:54:56.486
Get ready to move as soon as possible!

1352
00:54:56.486 --> 00:54:57.945
Get ready to move now!

1353
00:54:58.646 --> 00:55:00.356
(It's a wartime condition that's very urgent.)

1354
00:55:00.356 --> 00:55:02.285
(Getting ready to move in the fastest speed)

1355
00:55:03.285 --> 00:55:05.785
(They move outside without knowing what's going on.)

1356
00:55:08.626 --> 00:55:09.725
(Distributing grenades and blank ammunition for practice)

1357
00:55:09.725 --> 00:55:10.925
- It's a real grenade. - Oh, it's real.

1358
00:55:11.966 --> 00:55:13.236
Isn't it a real ammunition?

1359
00:55:13.236 --> 00:55:15.236
- It's a blank ammunition. - I've never done this before.

1360
00:55:15.595 --> 00:55:17.336
It's starting now.

1361
00:55:17.336 --> 00:55:18.405
Thank you, sir.

1362
00:55:18.405 --> 00:55:20.606
Wear this and use it.

1363
00:55:20.776 --> 00:55:22.336
- Is your call name a "Bravo"? - Yes, sir.

1364
00:55:22.336 --> 00:55:24.905
Report it on the walkie-talkie and say "Bravo".

1365
00:55:25.046 --> 00:55:26.345
Your call name is "Alpha".

1366
00:55:26.475 --> 00:55:27.876
- Got it? It's "Alpha". - "Alpha"?

1367
00:55:27.876 --> 00:55:29.316
You're Alpha. I'm a Black Bear.

1368
00:55:29.316 --> 00:55:33.385
It goes as Black Bear 1, 2, 3 in the order of squad.

1369
00:55:33.686 --> 00:55:35.115
- Get on the truck. - Yes, sir.

1370
00:55:35.115 --> 00:55:36.785
(Getting on the military truck)

1371
00:55:38.885 --> 00:55:40.055
(He's giving a glance.)

1372
00:55:41.155 --> 00:55:42.796
(He's lost.)

1373
00:55:43.666 --> 00:55:45.425
(This training period has a lot of mobilizations.)

1374
00:55:45.425 --> 00:55:47.135
We're on our way now.

1375
00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:49.035
(They're on their way to the operation area.)

1376
00:55:53.376 --> 00:55:54.675
(He's looking around.)

1377
00:55:55.675 --> 00:55:57.106
(Biting his lips)

1378
00:55:57.106 --> 00:55:59.345
Where we are going is...

1379
00:55:59.345 --> 00:56:00.916
a place in North Korea where no civilians are allowed.

1380
00:56:01.146 --> 00:56:03.186
- If there's no control... - Are you serious?

1381
00:56:03.816 --> 00:56:05.845
(Civilian access control line near Military Demarcation Line)

1382
00:56:06.986 --> 00:56:10.026
(Their area of operation is right above the DMZ.)

1383
00:56:10.026 --> 00:56:12.756
(5km to10km along the DMZ)

1384
00:56:12.756 --> 00:56:14.495
If you go somewhere not instructed,

1385
00:56:14.495 --> 00:56:16.095
- it could be dangerous. - Yes, sir.

1386
00:56:16.095 --> 00:56:18.026
They're on the military truck.

1387
00:56:19.666 --> 00:56:20.796
It's the civilian access control line.

1388
00:56:20.796 --> 00:56:23.506
It's a place where they can't control civilians.

1389
00:56:23.506 --> 00:56:25.765
(Can't control civilians?)

1390
00:56:25.836 --> 00:56:27.336
It's not that they can't control civilians.

1391
00:56:27.336 --> 00:56:29.135
It's where civilian access is controlled.

1392
00:56:29.135 --> 00:56:30.776
I mean civilian access is controlled there.

1393
00:56:30.776 --> 00:56:31.905
Yes, civilian access is controlled.

1394
00:56:31.905 --> 00:56:34.615
They say no entrance for civilians.

1395
00:56:34.615 --> 00:56:36.546
Yes, it's not that they can't control civilians.

1396
00:56:37.216 --> 00:56:39.586
(No houses are seen anymore.)

1397
00:56:39.586 --> 00:56:41.655
(They're moving to the north along the rough roads.)

1398
00:56:43.086 --> 00:56:45.725
(They just passed the civilian access control line.)

1399
00:56:45.725 --> 00:56:47.756
It gets more nervous as we pass the gates.

1400
00:56:49.995 --> 00:56:51.095
It's so serious.

1401
00:56:51.095 --> 00:56:52.466
- There's a moose. - It's an elk.

1402
00:56:52.466 --> 00:56:55.236
They can't fool around there.

1403
00:56:55.936 --> 00:56:57.606
It's very close to North Korea.

1404
00:56:57.606 --> 00:56:59.905
(Mines)

1405
00:56:59.936 --> 00:57:02.175
(It's not their military training. It's like they're at a battlefield.)

1406
00:57:02.535 --> 00:57:04.646
(They're extremely nervous.)

1407
00:57:08.575 --> 00:57:10.245
(They're at their operation area.)

1408
00:57:11.646 --> 00:57:12.785
(The truck door opens.)

1409
00:57:14.115 --> 00:57:15.515
(They freeze.)

1410
00:57:15.986 --> 00:57:17.126
Get off the vehicle.

1411
00:57:17.126 --> 00:57:18.986
(Their bodies freeze due to anxiety.)

1412
00:57:20.055 --> 00:57:21.555
(Grunting)

1413
00:57:21.995 --> 00:57:23.526
- Are you okay? - Yes, I am okay.

1414
00:57:24.296 --> 00:57:25.495
I slipped.

1415
00:57:26.396 --> 00:57:27.765
I slipped.

1416
00:57:30.966 --> 00:57:32.106
It's in.

1417
00:57:32.106 --> 00:57:33.135
(For realistic training,)

1418
00:57:33.805 --> 00:57:36.405
(they use MILES systems.)

1419
00:57:36.805 --> 00:57:38.675
When a weapon is fired, the sensors detect the laser.

1420
00:57:38.675 --> 00:57:41.445
There are 4 on the front, 4 on the back, and 2 on the arms.

1421
00:57:41.445 --> 00:57:43.515
Depending on where the person is hit,

1422
00:57:43.515 --> 00:57:45.686
the control center can make the judgments.

1423
00:57:45.716 --> 00:57:47.256
Face me and line up by the squad.

1424
00:57:47.256 --> 00:57:48.916
Squad commanders, come on up.

1425
00:57:49.456 --> 00:57:50.856
(What are we doing?)

1426
00:57:51.655 --> 00:57:53.655
(Training with MILES systems)

1427
00:57:54.655 --> 00:57:57.195
(Fight against the enemies and reclaim the high ground.)

1428
00:57:57.865 --> 00:57:59.736
Get ready in an hour.

1429
00:57:59.736 --> 00:58:01.896
(They must subdue the enemies on the top of the mountain.)

1430
00:58:02.905 --> 00:58:05.535
(Their mission is complete when they reclaim the high ground.)

1431
00:58:06.106 --> 00:58:09.546
(The rear patrols and the lead searches and scouts.)

1432
00:58:10.245 --> 00:58:13.416
The lead will search and scout the area.

1433
00:58:13.475 --> 00:58:14.975
When they run into the enemies,

1434
00:58:14.975 --> 00:58:17.015
they will report.

1435
00:58:18.015 --> 00:58:19.486
The soldiers are on the move.

1436
00:58:19.615 --> 00:58:20.655
My goodness.

1437
00:58:20.655 --> 00:58:21.986
(Jun Ha runs 5km.)

1438
00:58:21.986 --> 00:58:23.655
It's good to see him like that.

1439
00:58:23.655 --> 00:58:25.086
That's the halfway point.

1440
00:58:25.725 --> 00:58:27.655
- You are at the halfway point. - You ran 5km.

1441
00:58:27.655 --> 00:58:30.066
- You didn't take a single rest. - No, I didn't until 5km.

1442
00:58:30.396 --> 00:58:31.925
That's incredible.

1443
00:58:33.336 --> 00:58:34.695
(The squads move towards the high ground.)

1444
00:58:35.195 --> 00:58:36.206
Let's go.

1445
00:58:36.206 --> 00:58:38.006
(The reconnaissance squad must run at a full speed.)

1446
00:58:38.206 --> 00:58:39.365
- Run, run. - Okay.

1447
00:58:39.365 --> 00:58:40.736
Run, run. Run to survive.

1448
00:58:40.736 --> 00:58:42.506
- I am going. - Run, run, run.

1449
00:58:42.745 --> 00:58:44.845
The equipment is so heavy.

1450
00:58:47.845 --> 00:58:49.586
Alpha. Alpha respond.

1451
00:58:49.615 --> 00:58:51.916
This is Alpha. I am on guard.

1452
00:58:52.285 --> 00:58:53.486
Guard the rear.

1453
00:58:54.115 --> 00:58:55.216
Sae Ho, guard the rear.

1454
00:58:55.486 --> 00:58:57.486
It's a stakeout.

1455
00:58:58.725 --> 00:59:00.825
Camouflage yourself.

1456
00:59:01.155 --> 00:59:03.595
(They camouflage themselves.)

1457
00:59:04.896 --> 00:59:06.296
(Sniffling)

1458
00:59:07.535 --> 00:59:08.836
(Sniffling)

1459
00:59:09.535 --> 00:59:11.336
(My goodness.)

1460
00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:13.305
(He finishes camouflaging himself as he sniffles.)

1461
00:59:13.305 --> 00:59:15.305
This is Alpha. The camouflage is complete.

1462
00:59:16.175 --> 00:59:18.146
(Sae Ho is done as well.)

1463
00:59:19.816 --> 00:59:20.945
(He takes a look at his teeth.)

1464
00:59:20.945 --> 00:59:23.146
Bravo, Bravo, this is Black Bear.

1465
00:59:23.546 --> 00:59:25.216
(He doesn't realize he is being called.)

1466
00:59:26.055 --> 00:59:27.555
Didn't he call for Bravo?

1467
00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:29.115
No, he didn't.

1468
00:59:29.115 --> 00:59:30.555
- He did. - Did he?

1469
00:59:32.555 --> 00:59:33.725
This is Bravo.

1470
00:59:34.256 --> 00:59:36.695
- A transmission from Bravo. - "A transmission from Bravo".

1471
00:59:37.825 --> 00:59:40.535
Report back on the surroundings.

1472
00:59:41.195 --> 00:59:42.265
Clear.

1473
00:59:42.966 --> 00:59:44.035
"Clear".

1474
00:59:44.466 --> 00:59:45.535
Now...

1475
00:59:47.736 --> 00:59:48.736
What was that?

1476
00:59:49.035 --> 00:59:52.506
(The enemy bomb hits Myeong Soo's squad.)

1477
00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:55.245
Hurry up and get down.

1478
00:59:55.445 --> 00:59:56.745
(The chemical gas spreads.)

1479
00:59:56.745 --> 00:59:59.416
- You had to wear a gas mask. - It was a training,

1480
00:59:59.615 --> 01:00:01.555
but we had to put on a gas mask for real.

1481
01:00:01.856 --> 01:00:03.655
Put on a gas mask.

1482
01:00:04.486 --> 01:00:05.526
The gas mask.

1483
01:00:06.256 --> 01:00:08.456
(He learned how helpful a gas mask is.)

1484
01:00:08.995 --> 01:00:11.695
(He is bound to inhale gas if he doesn't wear a mask on time.)

1485
01:00:12.736 --> 01:00:14.495
(Can he wear a mask on time?)

1486
01:00:18.836 --> 01:00:21.436
(It takes him 6 seconds to raise his aged body.)

1487
01:00:22.305 --> 01:00:25.646
(Is he Sun Wukong who is trying to remove a headband?)

1488
01:00:27.316 --> 01:00:29.146
(He fails to put on a mask in 9 seconds.)

1489
01:00:30.115 --> 01:00:32.756
(He can't get his headband off.)

1490
01:00:33.686 --> 01:00:35.756
(It gets caught on a strap.)

1491
01:00:36.725 --> 01:00:38.655
(The gas is as thick as fine dust.)

1492
01:00:39.186 --> 01:00:41.195
(His chin strap gives him a problem this time.)

1493
01:00:41.695 --> 01:00:43.966
(He tries his best to take it off with his clumsy hands.)

1494
01:00:44.595 --> 01:00:45.896
(Clicking)

1495
01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:48.166
He is inhaling the gas.

1496
01:00:48.396 --> 01:00:50.236
It was a big struggle.

1497
01:00:51.706 --> 01:00:53.236
(What is he doing?)

1498
01:00:53.876 --> 01:00:56.606
(He puts on a mask after inhaling gas.)

1499
01:00:58.106 --> 01:00:59.745
(Not much is happening at the rear.)

1500
01:01:00.416 --> 01:01:02.916
(Yawning)

1501
01:01:03.316 --> 01:01:05.986
- He only slept two hours. - He must be tired.

1502
01:01:06.756 --> 01:01:09.186
(He exercised all morning.)

1503
01:01:09.186 --> 01:01:12.055
(He feels drowsy after eating a big lunch.)

1504
01:01:13.456 --> 01:01:16.126
- He is sleeping. - He must be tired.

1505
01:01:16.126 --> 01:01:17.595
I can't believe he is sleeping in that situation.

1506
01:01:18.026 --> 01:01:19.026
(Turning around)

1507
01:01:19.396 --> 01:01:21.166
(His eyes open wide.)

1508
01:01:21.396 --> 01:01:22.595
(Smiling bitterly)

1509
01:01:23.106 --> 01:01:24.905
(Why is he smiling?)

1510
01:01:25.236 --> 01:01:26.905
What kind of a smile was that?

1511
01:01:26.905 --> 01:01:30.206
I don't know. I either dreamed or got surprised by the situation.

1512
01:01:31.445 --> 01:01:33.675
(He manages to avoid getting caught.)

1513
01:01:34.075 --> 01:01:36.515
Eagle, this is Black Bear.

1514
01:01:36.515 --> 01:01:39.456
(He blinks to wake up, but falls asleep again.)

1515
01:01:40.216 --> 01:01:42.825
Move the soldier on the watch...

1516
01:01:42.825 --> 01:01:45.885
- to speed up the training. - Are you sleeping?

1517
01:01:45.885 --> 01:01:46.896
No, sir.

1518
01:01:47.055 --> 01:01:49.055
- Did you nod off? - No, sir.

1519
01:01:50.195 --> 01:01:51.765
- It looks like you did. - No, sir.

1520
01:01:52.566 --> 01:01:54.265
- Keep watch properly. - Yes, sir.

1521
01:01:55.466 --> 01:01:56.836
(Glancing)

1522
01:01:58.066 --> 01:02:01.276
(His eyes shut as soon as he finishes talking.)

1523
01:02:02.475 --> 01:02:03.776
He's cute.

1524
01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:10.486
(Myeong Soo has aged 10 years.)

1525
01:02:10.615 --> 01:02:13.086
Alpha, run over.

1526
01:02:13.716 --> 01:02:15.916
(Did he collect vegetables with his gun?)

1527
01:02:16.825 --> 01:02:18.555
(What is this?)

1528
01:02:19.425 --> 01:02:21.526
(He waddles when he is exhausted.)

1529
01:02:22.055 --> 01:02:23.695
Your mission is...

1530
01:02:23.695 --> 01:02:25.225
reconnaissance.

1531
01:02:25.526 --> 01:02:28.066
You must check for mines.

1532
01:02:28.066 --> 01:02:29.095
Yes, sir.

1533
01:02:29.865 --> 01:02:32.006
(The worst soldier is at the lead.)

1534
01:02:32.035 --> 01:02:33.936
The soldier will guide in the area.

1535
01:02:34.236 --> 01:02:36.376
Park Myeong Soo has sustained a slight injury.

1536
01:02:36.376 --> 01:02:38.575
Ask Medic Jo Woon Ho to treat him. Over.

1537
01:02:39.106 --> 01:02:40.575
(A slight injury?)

1538
01:02:41.015 --> 01:02:42.445
Is Private Park Myeong Soo hurt?

1539
01:02:42.445 --> 01:02:44.186
He stepped on a mine.

1540
01:02:45.486 --> 01:02:46.615
(Worried)

1541
01:02:46.615 --> 01:02:49.686
Since it's a slight injury, he will recover right away.

1542
01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:51.356
A transmission.

1543
01:02:51.725 --> 01:02:53.756
(3 minutes ago)

1544
01:02:54.526 --> 01:02:57.166
(The reconnaissance squad passes the area with mines.)

1545
01:02:57.725 --> 01:02:59.695
Stop, stop.

1546
01:03:00.095 --> 01:03:02.236
(The worst soldier steps on a mine.)

1547
01:03:03.066 --> 01:03:04.765
(He belatedly runs away.)

1548
01:03:05.135 --> 01:03:06.405
You are injured.

1549
01:03:08.575 --> 01:03:10.345
(Grimacing)

1550
01:03:10.345 --> 01:03:12.975
A little bit more. Hang in there.

1551
01:03:15.115 --> 01:03:16.385
Thank you.

1552
01:03:18.245 --> 01:03:21.785
(Since it's a slight injury, he goes back to the battle.)

1553
01:03:23.055 --> 01:03:24.626
(The high ground is nowhere near.)

1554
01:03:25.285 --> 01:03:27.896
(They hear a warning sound from their equipment.)

1555
01:03:28.225 --> 01:03:31.425
Now, you will move towards the enemies.

1556
01:03:31.626 --> 01:03:33.166
- Now, you will move... - This is the beginning.

1557
01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:34.495
- towards the enemies. - This is the beginning.

1558
01:03:35.195 --> 01:03:37.936
(The soldiers begin to sprint.)

1559
01:03:39.135 --> 01:03:41.236
(The new privates start running as well.)

1560
01:03:41.936 --> 01:03:44.506
They're the enemies. The enemies shoot at you.

1561
01:03:45.305 --> 01:03:46.575
(The enemies wear a yellow mark.)

1562
01:03:46.575 --> 01:03:49.716
(The starting point)

1563
01:03:50.686 --> 01:03:52.515
(He joins the others after receiving a treatment.)

1564
01:03:54.115 --> 01:03:57.086
(The worst private is at the front again.)

1565
01:03:58.155 --> 01:04:00.655
(The sound of gunshot pierces their ears.)

1566
01:04:00.655 --> 01:04:01.825
Where are they shooting from?

1567
01:04:02.765 --> 01:04:04.396
(The enemies fire warning shots.)

1568
01:04:05.966 --> 01:04:07.566
(His shoulders become hunched.)

1569
01:04:07.865 --> 01:04:09.506
- A bomb! - It's a bomb!

1570
01:04:10.066 --> 01:04:11.236
What do I do?

1571
01:04:11.566 --> 01:04:12.836
Should I get down?

1572
01:04:13.776 --> 01:04:15.405
(Startled)

1573
01:04:15.405 --> 01:04:18.345
Alpha, this is Black Bear Two.

1574
01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:19.975
(Dazed)

1575
01:04:20.845 --> 01:04:22.075
Alpha. Alpha.

1576
01:04:22.986 --> 01:04:24.285
(Oh, right.)

1577
01:04:26.256 --> 01:04:28.186
A transmission from Alpha.

1578
01:04:28.515 --> 01:04:30.956
Cross the open terrain and report.

1579
01:04:30.956 --> 01:04:32.925
(Cross the open terrain.)

1580
01:04:33.555 --> 01:04:34.626
Let's move.

1581
01:04:34.856 --> 01:04:36.466
Let's go, Sae Ho.

1582
01:04:37.225 --> 01:04:38.995
(Sae Ho runs at full speed.)

1583
01:04:40.035 --> 01:04:41.595
(March forward.)

1584
01:04:42.396 --> 01:04:44.206
Hurry up, hurry up.

1585
01:04:44.706 --> 01:04:46.405
Run, run, run.

1586
01:04:48.606 --> 01:04:50.706
- We must run in a zig-zag pattern. - That's right.

1587
01:04:50.876 --> 01:04:52.206
You must run in a zig-zag pattern.

1588
01:04:52.876 --> 01:04:54.816
Hurry up, hurry up.

1589
01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:58.186
(He must follow the other soldiers.)

1590
01:04:59.756 --> 01:05:01.115
(What?)

1591
01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:04.256
(His gun is tangled up in a shrub.)

1592
01:05:05.356 --> 01:05:07.595
(This gun is too heavy.)

1593
01:05:08.325 --> 01:05:10.365
(Waddling)

1594
01:05:11.466 --> 01:05:12.936
What is that?

1595
01:05:13.195 --> 01:05:15.296
Are you running or what?

1596
01:05:15.936 --> 01:05:18.305
(The other soldiers look like they will run up the mountain.)

1597
01:05:19.006 --> 01:05:20.305
(However)

1598
01:05:21.006 --> 01:05:23.006
(Firing)

1599
01:05:23.546 --> 01:05:25.745
(The sniper in the mountain attacks.)

1600
01:05:26.745 --> 01:05:28.916
(A fierce battle takes place.)

1601
01:05:29.686 --> 01:05:31.486
(Slow)

1602
01:05:31.816 --> 01:05:34.316
This is hilarious.

1603
01:05:36.055 --> 01:05:37.925
(The worst private waddles through the battlefield.)

1604
01:05:38.756 --> 01:05:42.055
(The enemies and the platoon leader are flustered.)

1605
01:05:43.195 --> 01:05:46.865
(It looks like he will be on the field all day.)

1606
01:05:47.995 --> 01:05:50.035
(The enemies fire at him.)

1607
01:05:50.535 --> 01:05:52.066
(The other soldier looks after him.)

1608
01:05:52.066 --> 01:05:53.075
Run, run.

1609
01:05:54.175 --> 01:05:55.975
This is driving me crazy.

1610
01:05:55.975 --> 01:05:57.506
(Beeping)

1611
01:05:57.506 --> 01:05:59.646
You hear a beeping sound when you get hit.

1612
01:06:00.345 --> 01:06:03.486
Private Park Myeong Soo is hit.

1613
01:06:04.186 --> 01:06:05.845
(The sniper has excellent shooting skills.)

1614
01:06:06.555 --> 01:06:11.055
(7 soldiers on their side die.)

1615
01:06:11.055 --> 01:06:13.725
(The fellow soldiers)

1616
01:06:14.456 --> 01:06:16.825
(I can't go back like this.)

1617
01:06:17.865 --> 01:06:19.796
(We need a hero.)

1618
01:06:21.635 --> 01:06:23.166
(A hero)

1619
01:06:24.405 --> 01:06:28.175
(At that moment, one man runs towards the enemies.)

1620
01:06:29.106 --> 01:06:31.206
(Is it Private Cho Sae Ho?)

1621
01:06:31.745 --> 01:06:33.376
(He reaches the foot of the mountain.)

1622
01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:36.546
(Is this where the enemies are at?)

1623
01:06:36.646 --> 01:06:39.046
(The sniper and Private Cho Sae Ho)

1624
01:06:39.046 --> 01:06:41.586
- Do you see him? - Yes, I see him checking us.

1625
01:06:41.716 --> 01:06:44.626
It was nerve-wracking.

1626
01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:46.825
- Of course it was. - There were enemies.

1627
01:06:47.626 --> 01:06:49.026
(Concentrating hard)

1628
01:06:50.195 --> 01:06:53.736
(He skips the greetings and shoots one.)

1629
01:06:54.635 --> 01:06:58.035
(He shoots without hesitation.)

1630
01:06:58.865 --> 01:07:00.305
(They see the target beyond the stronghold.)

1631
01:07:01.405 --> 01:07:04.876
(I will avenge Myeong Soo and my fellow soldiers.)

1632
01:07:05.475 --> 01:07:07.416
(He shoots without stopping.)

1633
01:07:09.885 --> 01:07:11.186
How cool!

1634
01:07:11.186 --> 01:07:12.646
He got hit.

1635
01:07:13.385 --> 01:07:15.816
(One of the enemies gets injured.)

1636
01:07:15.816 --> 01:07:17.225
(Unbelievable)

1637
01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:18.555
We have someone injured.

1638
01:07:18.885 --> 01:07:20.595
(He's proud of himself.)

1639
01:07:22.256 --> 01:07:24.066
(His fellow soldiers are surprised.)

1640
01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.995
(Wasn't there one more?)

1641
01:07:27.995 --> 01:07:28.995
(Shooting)

1642
01:07:29.736 --> 01:07:30.836
(He shoots mercilessly.)

1643
01:07:33.206 --> 01:07:35.506
- Again? - Good job.

1644
01:07:36.106 --> 01:07:37.175
He's a fat soldier.

1645
01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.745
(He's happy with himself.)

1646
01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:43.345
(His confidence goes up.)

1647
01:07:43.345 --> 01:07:44.445
(Aren't I cool?)

1648
01:07:44.745 --> 01:07:46.356
- Are you injured? - I'm fine.

1649
01:07:46.885 --> 01:07:50.486
We eliminated two enemy soldiers.

1650
01:07:51.055 --> 01:07:52.055
They may back up.

1651
01:07:52.356 --> 01:07:53.725
Help him.

1652
01:07:53.725 --> 01:07:55.856
- Again? - He's like a mummy.

1653
01:07:56.495 --> 01:07:59.325
He stepped on a mine and got shot.

1654
01:07:59.566 --> 01:08:00.865
He's treated.

1655
01:08:00.865 --> 01:08:01.966
(Like this?)

1656
01:08:02.236 --> 01:08:03.805
- Keep going. - Do we continue fighting?

1657
01:08:03.966 --> 01:08:04.966
Yes.

1658
01:08:05.006 --> 01:08:06.106
Do I keep fighting like this?

1659
01:08:06.776 --> 01:08:08.675
- We must go. - Am I a robot?

1660
01:08:08.675 --> 01:08:10.605
I came back to life.

1661
01:08:10.605 --> 01:08:12.945
I was injured but came back to life.

1662
01:08:13.145 --> 01:08:15.245
Move to the next place.

1663
01:08:15.245 --> 01:08:17.185
Move together.

1664
01:08:17.685 --> 01:08:18.985
Start running.

1665
01:08:19.516 --> 01:08:20.685
(Jun Ha is still running.)

1666
01:08:21.416 --> 01:08:23.056
I was in conflict.

1667
01:08:23.056 --> 01:08:26.155
I thought about stop running.

1668
01:08:26.155 --> 01:08:28.556
- There must be something. - Jun Ha is...

1669
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:30.626
in a lonely fight.

1670
01:08:30.695 --> 01:08:33.166
What Jun Ha is doing is difficult too.

1671
01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:34.166
(He runs 6.5km in silence.)

1672
01:08:36.065 --> 01:08:37.065
Are you okay?

1673
01:08:38.666 --> 01:08:40.235
(The bandage is dangling.)

1674
01:08:41.275 --> 01:08:44.706
- Gosh. - They're over there.

1675
01:08:44.706 --> 01:08:46.376
We'll go around and attack.

1676
01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:48.245
- Do we climb up again? - This is the last.

1677
01:08:48.245 --> 01:08:49.945
- It's over after this attack. - It's the last.

1678
01:08:49.945 --> 01:08:51.086
Follow me.

1679
01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:52.716
(They go in the mountain.)

1680
01:08:53.615 --> 01:08:56.456
- This is the worst part. - Right.

1681
01:08:56.525 --> 01:08:58.956
It's been easy enough until now.

1682
01:08:58.956 --> 01:09:00.655
(The slope is very steep.)

1683
01:09:01.256 --> 01:09:03.695
Climbing up was very difficult.

1684
01:09:03.695 --> 01:09:05.126
Seriously.

1685
01:09:05.266 --> 01:09:06.266
Go up first.

1686
01:09:09.905 --> 01:09:10.935
(Groaning)

1687
01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:12.006
(It's slippery.)

1688
01:09:15.506 --> 01:09:16.876
(Grunting)

1689
01:09:18.176 --> 01:09:19.645
It's too hard for me.

1690
01:09:20.145 --> 01:09:21.176
(Please spare me.)

1691
01:09:21.176 --> 01:09:22.245
(He breathes heavily.)

1692
01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:23.315
Wait a minute.

1693
01:09:24.546 --> 01:09:26.456
(His senior shares his water.)

1694
01:09:26.855 --> 01:09:29.115
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

1695
01:09:30.756 --> 01:09:32.256
(He takes a sip of water.)

1696
01:09:32.256 --> 01:09:33.426
It must have been hard.

1697
01:09:33.456 --> 01:09:35.355
- It was unbelievable. - Seriously.

1698
01:09:35.756 --> 01:09:36.865
It was so difficult.

1699
01:09:37.296 --> 01:09:38.796
Where's your current location?

1700
01:09:38.796 --> 01:09:39.865
(Sae Ho gets more confident.)

1701
01:09:42.905 --> 01:09:43.905
(Come here.)

1702
01:09:45.136 --> 01:09:46.836
(Who needs me?)

1703
01:09:48.876 --> 01:09:50.275
(They spot the enemy.)

1704
01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:53.346
(He aims his rifle.)

1705
01:09:54.245 --> 01:09:55.716
(Two shots are enough.)

1706
01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:57.485
Load your gun.

1707
01:09:58.586 --> 01:09:59.886
(He makes a bold attack.)

1708
01:10:01.086 --> 01:10:02.685
(He shocks and scares the enemy.)

1709
01:10:03.456 --> 01:10:04.456
That's insane.

1710
01:10:05.056 --> 01:10:06.195
It's intense.

1711
01:10:07.325 --> 01:10:10.065
(Sae Ho discovers an unexpected talent.)

1712
01:10:11.126 --> 01:10:14.365
(He shoots the enemy soldiers one after the other.)

1713
01:10:17.105 --> 01:10:18.435
(Are you watching me?)

1714
01:10:20.275 --> 01:10:22.075
(Myeong Soo walks with his gaze to the ground.)

1715
01:10:22.976 --> 01:10:24.346
(They arrive near a high ground.)

1716
01:10:25.006 --> 01:10:26.645
- They were hiding. - He gets shot again.

1717
01:10:26.645 --> 01:10:27.676
Does he get shot again?

1718
01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:31.086
(The target is aimed.)

1719
01:10:32.785 --> 01:10:34.086
(He welcomes him by shooting.)

1720
01:10:35.556 --> 01:10:36.825
Come this way.

1721
01:10:37.886 --> 01:10:38.886
(He's injured for the 3rd time.)

1722
01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:39.995
He gets shot again.

1723
01:10:40.495 --> 01:10:42.155
- What happened? - How many lives does he have?

1724
01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:43.525
Did I get shot again?

1725
01:10:43.525 --> 01:10:44.995
- Did I die? - He's slightly injured.

1726
01:10:44.995 --> 01:10:47.365
Why don't I ever die? Goodness.

1727
01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:49.266
He's slightly injured.

1728
01:10:50.336 --> 01:10:51.865
He gets injured everywhere.

1729
01:10:51.865 --> 01:10:53.035
- He's slightly injured. - Wait.

1730
01:10:53.535 --> 01:10:55.206
I was injured twice already.

1731
01:10:55.306 --> 01:10:57.075
Why do you make me climb up?

1732
01:10:58.275 --> 01:10:59.745
He's like a zombie.

1733
01:11:01.876 --> 01:11:04.046
(Let me take a rest in the corner.)

1734
01:11:04.046 --> 01:11:05.416
(Screaming in pain)

1735
01:11:06.485 --> 01:11:08.315
(His finger gets pressed down by the rifle.)

1736
01:11:11.025 --> 01:11:13.056
- Did you get hurt? - His hand got hurt.

1737
01:11:15.796 --> 01:11:17.096
(Screaming)

1738
01:11:17.096 --> 01:11:18.796
It was pinched by the rifle.

1739
01:11:18.796 --> 01:11:20.065
(It hurts. Be careful.)

1740
01:11:20.065 --> 01:11:21.365
Don't squeeze out the blood.

1741
01:11:21.365 --> 01:11:22.766
(He exaggerates his pain.)

1742
01:11:22.766 --> 01:11:24.836
- Did you hurt your finger? - Yes.

1743
01:11:24.836 --> 01:11:26.235
- It's too big. - He's exaggerating.

1744
01:11:26.235 --> 01:11:27.506
There was no bandage.

1745
01:11:27.676 --> 01:11:30.245
Including the real injury, he was bandaged four times.

1746
01:11:30.245 --> 01:11:31.346
Goodness.

1747
01:11:31.346 --> 01:11:33.145
(His whole hand is bandaged.)

1748
01:11:33.416 --> 01:11:35.376
I'll shoot as much as I want.

1749
01:11:36.685 --> 01:11:37.685
Let's go.

1750
01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:39.086
Let's go.

1751
01:11:39.346 --> 01:11:40.416
Let's go.

1752
01:11:41.586 --> 01:11:44.056
Go. Run forward.

1753
01:11:44.956 --> 01:11:46.056
Shoot.

1754
01:11:46.056 --> 01:11:47.056
(I'll shoot too.)

1755
01:11:48.726 --> 01:11:50.365
(His rifle muzzle moves in the air.)

1756
01:11:52.766 --> 01:11:55.796
(He shoots with anger and releases his pain.)

1757
01:11:57.636 --> 01:11:59.775
(People shoot from everywhere.)

1758
01:12:01.105 --> 01:12:03.006
I shot with good aim, but why is everyone alive?

1759
01:12:06.645 --> 01:12:09.445
(They only hear the shooting sound.)

1760
01:12:11.145 --> 01:12:13.815
This is Black Bear. The battle is over.

1761
01:12:13.815 --> 01:12:15.586
- It's over. - Okay. It's over.

1762
01:12:15.586 --> 01:12:16.586
What happened?

1763
01:12:16.586 --> 01:12:17.726
We eliminated everyone.

1764
01:12:18.685 --> 01:12:20.456
- Is that so? - Yes.

1765
01:12:21.626 --> 01:12:23.525
(We're safe.)

1766
01:12:24.995 --> 01:12:26.865
This training was intense.

1767
01:12:27.266 --> 01:12:28.336
Good job.

1768
01:12:28.596 --> 01:12:29.766
It's over.

1769
01:12:29.806 --> 01:12:32.166
- Attention, everyone. - Attention.

1770
01:12:32.336 --> 01:12:36.476
I'll announce the result of the training.

1771
01:12:36.806 --> 01:12:40.745
Staff Sergeant Kim Nam Young killed 6 and injured 1.

1772
01:12:40.945 --> 01:12:45.046
Corporal Hwang Gyu Hyun killed 3 and injured 1.

1773
01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:47.155
(They applaud for their accomplishments.)

1774
01:12:47.785 --> 01:12:49.155
- Cho Sae Ho. - Yes, sir.

1775
01:12:49.155 --> 01:12:50.655
(How did Sae Ho do?)

1776
01:12:51.256 --> 01:12:53.096
You killed 4 and injured 3.

1777
01:12:53.226 --> 01:12:55.155
- That's me. - You killed 4 and injured 3.

1778
01:12:55.796 --> 01:12:56.865
Did I kill four?

1779
01:12:56.865 --> 01:12:58.766
You killed 4 and injured 3.

1780
01:12:58.766 --> 01:13:00.836
- Did I? - Next...

1781
01:13:00.865 --> 01:13:03.105
(He did well towards the end.)

1782
01:13:03.865 --> 01:13:06.006
(Sae Ho shot the enemy sniper.)

1783
01:13:06.676 --> 01:13:07.706
(He's jealous.)

1784
01:13:09.006 --> 01:13:10.176
Private Park Myeong Soo.

1785
01:13:10.176 --> 01:13:12.706
(Myeong Soo had difficulties. How did he do?)

1786
01:13:12.706 --> 01:13:15.145
You killed 2 and injured 1.

1787
01:13:15.815 --> 01:13:16.815
(Surprised)

1788
01:13:17.785 --> 01:13:19.346
(Did Myeong Soo really do that?)

1789
01:13:20.155 --> 01:13:21.685
(He struggled with a finger injury.)

1790
01:13:22.516 --> 01:13:23.556
(I see the enemy.)

1791
01:13:24.226 --> 01:13:25.456
(When he saw the enemy...)

1792
01:13:25.456 --> 01:13:26.726
Run forward.

1793
01:13:26.726 --> 01:13:27.825
(He completely changed.)

1794
01:13:28.756 --> 01:13:29.966
(Shoot now.)

1795
01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:33.565
(He shot at the enemy without hesitation.)

1796
01:13:34.266 --> 01:13:38.035
(His attack made the enemy retreat.)

1797
01:13:39.065 --> 01:13:41.636
(What's going on?)

1798
01:13:42.476 --> 01:13:46.376
(Myeong already shot 2 soldiers.)

1799
01:13:47.775 --> 01:13:50.145
Killing two people is really difficult too.

1800
01:13:50.145 --> 01:13:53.615
Did I really kill them?

1801
01:13:53.615 --> 01:13:54.756
You killed two people.

1802
01:13:55.155 --> 01:13:58.056
He should serve in the military unit all over in Korea.

1803
01:13:58.056 --> 01:13:59.995
That's a good idea.

1804
01:13:59.995 --> 01:14:02.726
- That's impressive. - He loves the military.

1805
01:14:03.726 --> 01:14:05.166
He's the second Mr. Popeye.

1806
01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:06.336
(He's the second Lee Sang Yong.)

1807
01:14:07.636 --> 01:14:10.266
After such a difficult training,

1808
01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:11.435
everyone becomes closer to each other.

1809
01:14:11.435 --> 01:14:13.176
- After only one day... - Goodness.

1810
01:14:13.176 --> 01:14:14.806
They worked very hard.

1811
01:14:15.105 --> 01:14:18.275
My legs hurt, so I'll sit down.

1812
01:14:18.476 --> 01:14:19.876
Their bodies must feel heavy.

1813
01:14:19.876 --> 01:14:22.645
I couldn't stretch my body.

1814
01:14:23.086 --> 01:14:25.985
Good job today. Let's chant before returning to the dormitory.

1815
01:14:25.985 --> 01:14:27.855
Then you may rest. Understood?

1816
01:14:27.855 --> 01:14:28.855
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1817
01:14:28.956 --> 01:14:31.855
- Who are we? - We're Butane Military Unit.

1818
01:14:31.855 --> 01:14:34.025
(He avoids eye contact.)

1819
01:14:34.195 --> 01:14:35.895
At ease. You're dismissed.

1820
01:14:35.895 --> 01:14:37.726
- Good job. - Good job, everyone.

1821
01:14:38.726 --> 01:14:41.636
What? Is Jun Ha still running?

1822
01:14:41.636 --> 01:14:43.506
This is a different scene.

1823
01:14:44.235 --> 01:14:47.775
I ran 8km without a rest.

1824
01:14:47.876 --> 01:14:50.976
- I'd be walking if I were you. - Goodness.

1825
01:14:50.976 --> 01:14:53.315
- Running 10km isn't easy. - Jun Ha's endurance...

1826
01:14:53.346 --> 01:14:55.476
- is amazing. - That's true.

1827
01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:57.285
- It's amazing. - It's incredible.

1828
01:14:57.445 --> 01:15:00.056
(It's a break time at the military base.)

1829
01:15:00.886 --> 01:15:02.926
(He takes a shower first.)

1830
01:15:02.926 --> 01:15:03.985
I'm next.

1831
01:15:04.256 --> 01:15:06.556
(Groaning)

1832
01:15:09.895 --> 01:15:10.995
(He wipes his feet.)

1833
01:15:12.065 --> 01:15:14.166
May I borrow some lotion?

1834
01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:15.166
(He cleans his feet thoroughly.)

1835
01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:17.735
- This lotion is not good. - I don't mind.

1836
01:15:19.336 --> 01:15:21.535
(He wipes his feet very hard.)

1837
01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:24.876
(He cleans the floor as well.)

1838
01:15:25.945 --> 01:15:27.346
(He needs to throw that towel away.)

1839
01:15:28.846 --> 01:15:30.846
- I'm so tired. - He folds it neatly.

1840
01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:33.716
- It was only a day. - I know.

1841
01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:35.855
He wiped his feet with it.

1842
01:15:35.855 --> 01:15:37.756
You're very impressive.

1843
01:15:38.685 --> 01:15:40.456
- You're very impressive. - Goodness.

1844
01:15:40.456 --> 01:15:42.155
He'll get athlete's foot in his head.

1845
01:15:42.766 --> 01:15:44.695
No wonder my head was itchy.

1846
01:15:44.695 --> 01:15:45.865
My goodness.

1847
01:15:45.865 --> 01:15:47.195
Do you use this?

1848
01:15:47.695 --> 01:15:48.766
(Everyone is laughing.)

1849
01:15:48.766 --> 01:15:50.136
He wiped his feet with it.

1850
01:15:50.266 --> 01:15:51.666
(Myeong Soo can't laugh.)

1851
01:15:53.105 --> 01:15:54.476
(He finished his shower.)

1852
01:15:54.876 --> 01:15:56.645
I didn't wash properly.

1853
01:15:57.006 --> 01:15:59.945
Did you use the towel? Bring it to me now.

1854
01:15:59.945 --> 01:16:01.315
(My towel?)

1855
01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:04.216
(Here you go.)

1856
01:16:05.445 --> 01:16:07.886
(He goes back to shower again.)

1857
01:16:09.556 --> 01:16:10.655
(It smells rather good.)

1858
01:16:10.655 --> 01:16:11.685
(Sae Ho's towel is great.)

1859
01:16:11.685 --> 01:16:12.685
It's refreshing.

1860
01:16:13.456 --> 01:16:16.226
(After picking his ears, he feels better.)

1861
01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.796
Say goodbye to everyone and pack up.

1862
01:16:20.796 --> 01:16:23.166
- Okay. - Thank you very much.

1863
01:16:23.235 --> 01:16:26.206
Please take care of yourself.

1864
01:16:26.605 --> 01:16:27.735
- Salute. - Salute.

1865
01:16:27.735 --> 01:16:30.105
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1866
01:16:30.605 --> 01:16:31.846
Stay healthy.

1867
01:16:32.075 --> 01:16:34.615
Take care of yourself. Don't get injured like me.

1868
01:16:34.615 --> 01:16:38.346
Your training is over as of January 17, 2018, 10pm.

1869
01:16:38.346 --> 01:16:39.615
Good job. You're dismissed.

1870
01:16:39.655 --> 01:16:40.756
- Thank you. - Sir.

1871
01:16:41.155 --> 01:16:45.685
Among all the platoon leaders, you're the most handsome one.

1872
01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:46.756
- Salute. - Salute.

1873
01:16:47.456 --> 01:16:48.926
- Salute. - Attention.

1874
01:16:49.466 --> 01:16:50.466
Turn around.

1875
01:16:52.226 --> 01:16:53.636
Go home.

1876
01:16:56.806 --> 01:16:57.806
Shall we run?

1877
01:16:57.806 --> 01:17:00.176
(Let's go home now.)

1878
01:17:03.645 --> 01:17:04.806
- You worked hard. - Yes.

1879
01:17:06.046 --> 01:17:08.216
It's not over for us yet.

1880
01:17:08.216 --> 01:17:09.815
- I'm sorry. - Your training is over,

1881
01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:13.056
but Jun Ha has to finish the marathon.

1882
01:17:13.086 --> 01:17:14.756
Let's see how it ends.

1883
01:17:14.756 --> 01:17:16.226
- We watched until the 8km point. - It was up to 8km.

1884
01:17:16.226 --> 01:17:17.386
We'll conclude after. Yes, 8km.

1885
01:17:17.456 --> 01:17:20.025
Where are you right now, Jun Ha?

1886
01:17:20.256 --> 01:17:21.426
Where are you?

1887
01:17:22.926 --> 01:17:25.096
(He finishes the last 2km while gasping for breath.)

1888
01:17:25.666 --> 01:17:27.035
He made it.

1889
01:17:27.035 --> 01:17:28.695
(He finally reaches the finish line.)

1890
01:17:28.695 --> 01:17:30.105
Here he is.

1891
01:17:30.565 --> 01:17:31.636
He made it.

1892
01:17:31.706 --> 01:17:34.336
Jung Jun Ha. 1 hour 10 minutes 30 seconds.

1893
01:17:34.336 --> 01:17:36.245
- 1 hour 10 minutes? - That's so fast.

1894
01:17:37.346 --> 01:17:39.105
- 1 hour 10 minutes? - That's so incredible.

1895
01:17:39.105 --> 01:17:40.516
You're incredible.

1896
01:17:40.676 --> 01:17:41.846
That's incredible.

1897
01:17:43.445 --> 01:17:44.546
Anyway,

1898
01:17:44.815 --> 01:17:46.855
he didn't do it voluntarily,

1899
01:17:46.956 --> 01:17:48.655
but he ran 10k regardless.

1900
01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:50.926
(He completes the mission.)

1901
01:17:51.426 --> 01:17:52.456
Finisher's certificate.

1902
01:17:52.456 --> 01:17:54.025
(He's proud.)

1903
01:17:54.025 --> 01:17:55.096
My gosh.

1904
01:17:55.596 --> 01:17:58.695
(He calls somebody as soon as he's done.)

1905
01:17:59.495 --> 01:18:00.836
- Dad. - Lo Ha,

1906
01:18:00.836 --> 01:18:02.395
I ran the marathon.

1907
01:18:03.435 --> 01:18:05.266
What's that?

1908
01:18:05.266 --> 01:18:07.605
- You don't know what a marathon is? - No.

1909
01:18:07.605 --> 01:18:08.836
It's running.

1910
01:18:09.645 --> 01:18:10.706
Why?

1911
01:18:10.706 --> 01:18:12.546
- Why did I run? - Yes.

1912
01:18:12.706 --> 01:18:14.245
Somebody made me.

1913
01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:16.516
(Do you know who that is?)

1914
01:18:16.546 --> 01:18:17.745
Andy Warhol.

1915
01:18:18.516 --> 01:18:19.716
Andy Warhol.

1916
01:18:20.456 --> 01:18:22.726
(1 Hour Before)

1917
01:18:22.726 --> 01:18:25.325
The cold weather continues.

1918
01:18:25.886 --> 01:18:27.796
(Line up if you want to stay at home.)

1919
01:18:28.695 --> 01:18:30.995
(Line up if you want to go outside.)

1920
01:18:31.825 --> 01:18:33.565
(Let's go outside, dear.)

1921
01:18:34.336 --> 01:18:35.695
(It's dangerous outside.)

1922
01:18:35.695 --> 01:18:37.035
(It's boring at home.)

1923
01:18:37.605 --> 01:18:40.235
(It's a battle of "likes".)

1924
01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:43.546
(Going to Sae Ho's house without Sae Ho)

1925
01:18:44.645 --> 01:18:48.846
(It's a fashion show with Sae Ho's clothes without Sae Ho.)

1926
01:18:49.586 --> 01:18:50.945
We're going to freeze to death.

1927
01:18:51.016 --> 01:18:53.615
(Sae Ho takes off his clothes in the middle of winter.)

1928
01:18:54.615 --> 01:18:57.456
(They face the cold weather.)

1929
01:18:58.126 --> 01:18:59.395
(Fight fire with fire.)

1930
01:18:59.395 --> 01:19:00.556
(Fight cold with cold.)

1931
01:19:01.296 --> 01:19:04.525
(How to survive the winter inside and outside)

1932
01:19:05.626 --> 01:19:07.242
(House In and Out)
