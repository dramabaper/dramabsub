1
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.700
It's always better when we're together,

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.010
- Happy Together! - Happy Together!

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.170
(Every Thursday night, Happy Together)

4
00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.209
- Hello. - It's good to see you again.

5
00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.079
Hyun Moo, we haven't seen you for a long time.

6
00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.649
I know. It feels strange...

7
00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:18.649
(While we couldn't see him...)

8
00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:21.379
Jun Hyun Moo from "I Live Alone".

9
00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:24.450
(Hyun Moo won Grand Award at MBC Entertainment Awards.)

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.349
Jae Seok and Myung Soo...

11
00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.860
(He gained the achievement just as Jae Seok and Myung Soo did.)

12
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.489
I am overwhelmingly happy.

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.299
(And a thoughtful comment continued...)

14
00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:37.130
(in the hope of normalization of KBS.)

15
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.869
Hyun Moo, please continue your good work.

16
00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.369
- Just be confident. - "Just be confident."

17
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:45.540
Your advice is greatly helpful for me.

18
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.310
We haven't told the viewers about today's theme.

19
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.710
Today's theme is...

20
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.949
- "Korea's Hottest Men Special"... - It was fun.

21
00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.049
is our old theme.

22
00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.649
Following "Korea's Hottest Men Special",

23
00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.290
today's theme is "Korea's Hottest Women Special".

24
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.320
That's right.

25
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.589
Now, please introduce our first guest.

26
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.229
She's famous for her curvy body.

27
00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.529
She's charismatic and adorable at the same time.

28
00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:08.729
She just began to do variety shows.

29
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.899
I can't wait to see her.

30
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830
Lovely Han, Han Eun Jung.

31
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.570
(She is here.)

32
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.770
(What's going on?)

33
00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.139
- Where is she? - Is she here?

34
00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:19.169
She's there.

35
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.240
(A confident walk)

36
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.009
She's very popular these days.

37
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.050
(A parody of her TV commercial)

38
00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:31.320
(She shows her ambition for variety shows.)

39
00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:32.690
- She's so popular. - It's nice to meet you all.

40
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.619
I'm surprised. She would hesitate to do things like that...

41
00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.460
- even if she was asked. - We didn't even ask her to do so.

42
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.290
Now, she does it even when we didn't ask her to do that.

43
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.399
I've learned enough to do it on my own.

44
00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.529
(She became a rising star of variety shows.)

45
00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:44.630
- It's nice to see you all. - You are right.

46
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.869
It's about time for you to do it on your own.

47
00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.499
Let's meet our second guest.

48
00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.009
She's a comedienne with a pretty face and her charming cheesiness.

49
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.639
Her hobby and specialty is enjoying romance.

50
00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.240
- The romantic Kim Ji Min. - Kim Ji Min.

51
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.149
(She has a unique sense of style.)

52
00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.190
(She walks shyly, yet confidently.)

53
00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:06.820
She's a fashionista.

54
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.620
- Hello. I'm Kim Ji Min. - Welcome, Ji Min.

55
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.989
I'm honored to introduce these two guests.

56
00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.259
- They'll come out together. - The two hottest Chae Yeons...

57
00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.160
- in Korea are here. - Two Chae Yeons?

58
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.669
- Yes, two Chae Yeons. - I see.

59
00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.729
Shall we meet the innocent Chae Yeon first?

60
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.470
(From a famous trainee to a popular star)

61
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.870
She's the next icon of first love following Suzy.

62
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.109
Jung Chae Yeon of Dia.

63
00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.380
(The innocent Jung Chae Yeon of Dia)

64
00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.880
Jung Chae Yeon.

65
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.579
- How pretty. - Jung Chae Yeon.

66
00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:34.620
(Light steps and shy hand gestures)

67
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.549
(As she walks into the studio,)

68
00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.419
(a breeze blows flowers even though it's winter.)

69
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.889
- She looks so young and pretty. - How pretty.

70
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.190
(She missed the beat.)

71
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.000
(She made everyone laugh unexpectedly.)

72
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.500
(But she doesn't care.)

73
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.030
Look at her.

74
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.769
Gosh. She's so funny.

75
00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.000
(It's funny because she's so serious.)

76
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.970
- My goodness. - She looks emotionless.

77
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.570
That's right. Chae Yeon.

78
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.179
- She's not listening. - I mean,

79
00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.509
you're dancing like a robot.

80
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.009
- She looks like a cyborg. - Exactly.

81
00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.350
What is she doing?

82
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.889
- You need a soul. - Chae Yeon.

83
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.690
She's dancing like a machine.

84
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.919
(The cyborg beauty dances with her all might.)

85
00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.919
- She looks emotionless. - She's running out of battery.

86
00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.429
Chae Yeon.

87
00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:19.530
(The cyborg dance transmission completed)

88
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.000
My goodness.

89
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.400
- She's like a machine. - Chae Yeon.

90
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.329
- Yes? - This is a variety show.

91
00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.929
You danced as if you were on stage.

92
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.400
You didn't care about what was going on around you.

93
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.040
You didn't even look back when we were laughing.

94
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.679
(Her initiation into variety shows is over.)

95
00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.040
Next up is the sexy Chae Yeon.

96
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.650
(The master of seduction who is sexy in every way)

97
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.750
(Her absolute attractiveness even beats time.)

98
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.750
(Chae Yeon, the sexy diva)

99
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.049
The sexy Chae Yeon.

100
00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.620
Chae Yeon.

101
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.690
She's here.

102
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.759
(Excited)

103
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.560
(Powerful)

104
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.290
There she comes.

105
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.630
(She's full of sexiness.)

106
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.299
- My gosh. - Hyun Moo.

107
00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.329
(Skillful)

108
00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.400
Look at her.

109
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.329
(She starts dancing sexy dance with hip roll.)

110
00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.470
- She's great as always. - My gosh.

111
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.500
(She makes a cute face for her fans.)

112
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.940
- She looks lively. - She's authentic.

113
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.540
- She looks around... - Right. She's different.

114
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.509
- She looks around. - while dancing.

115
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:10.750
(She bursts out laughing at their excessive compliments.)

116
00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.579
You know...

117
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.950
Chae Yeon, you looked around you while performing.

118
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.590
- She looked more relaxed. - She looked around.

119
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.689
Jung Chae Yeon didn't look at us.

120
00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.020
Chae Yeon feels more like a human.

121
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.229
- She feels like a human. - That's right.

122
00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.530
I didn't know the two of them would appear on this show together.

123
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.600
- Seeing them here today... - How will you call us?

124
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.299
Since it's confusing, we'll call you Jin Sook.

125
00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:33.470
(Chae Yeon's real name is Jin Sook.)

126
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.900
- It's your real name. - That's not a good idea.

127
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.210
It would be pointless for us to have the same name.

128
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.210
- She changed her name 10 years ago. - That's right.

129
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.910
(Both are Chae Yeon.)

130
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.249
We invited the four stars who a lot of people wish...

131
00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:46.749
to have as their online girlfriend.

132
00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.479
However, almost none of them knew what online girlfriend means.

133
00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.549
What did Eun Jung say when she was asked about online girlfriend?

134
00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:56.090
She said that it's a girlfriend people meet through phone dating.

135
00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.189
- Phone dating? - Yes.

136
00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:00.400
- That's what came to her mind. - I haven't heard of it for a while.

137
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.100
Our writer said it means she's popular with the internet users.

138
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.470
Then she said, "I think your voice matters more than your personality."

139
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.140
She thought the writer was talking about phone dating.

140
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.669
I guess she thought of a telephone line,

141
00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.640
so dating over the phone came across her mind.

142
00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.239
As far as Eun Jung knows...

143
00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:17.280
Hold on a second. Do your writers tell you things like this as well?

144
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.049
- They tell us everything. - Of course.

145
00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:20.080
They record all the calls.

146
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.049
I asked the writer not to talk about that on the show.

147
00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:24.119
- They like that kind of stories. - That's why they added it.

148
00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:26.619
How you asked not to mention it is written on our script too.

149
00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:29.090
- You shouldn't have said it. - A favor like that...

150
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.689
only encourages them to add the story to the script.

151
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.790
"This kind of story must be told."

152
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.299
- This is a scary program. - Yes.

153
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.600
- Of course. - When I heard about phone...

154
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.729
I mean, online girlfriend,

155
00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.239
- I thought it was phone dating. - She says it so naturally.

156
00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.210
I was asked about the qualifications for online girlfriend.

157
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.739
I said, "A pretty voice."

158
00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.910
- She's not familiar with internet. - Right.

159
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.650
In fact, in the past, we used...

160
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.679
- phone-line networking. - That's right.

161
00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.689
Telephone wires were used before, so it's understandable.

162
00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.450
I thought of online video call.

163
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.989
- Online video call? - Online video call.

164
00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:04.059
- That was my best guess. - Not even phone video call.

165
00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.729
- We can learn what we don't know. - That's right.

166
00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.299
You don't have to be embarrassed.

167
00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:10.030
Ji Min, you're in no place to laugh at them.

168
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.799
You said you didn't understand why you were invited.

169
00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:14.939
- That's right. - She asked if she's a virtual star.

170
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.340
She thought of a cyber world.

171
00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:20.540
Cyber world...

172
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.109
- This is the era of cyber world. - That's...

173
00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:26.410
- She's a cyber female warrior. - Put your hand off of me.

174
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.919
Along with Lee Jung Hyun.

175
00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.650
She used to be a cyber female warrior.

176
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.319
Chae Yeon was one of the most futuristic singers.

177
00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.660
- That's not true. - She always wore silver outfits.

178
00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.489
- Right. - She's the same age as Lusia.

179
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.830
I haven't heard that name Lusia for a long time.

180
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.030
- A cyber singer like Adam. - She's a friend of Adam's.

181
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.729
Ji Min, seeing that you thought of a cyber star,

182
00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.069
you didn't know what online girlfriend means.

183
00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:50.510
At least I thought of the internet...

184
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.770
- while she thought of telephone. - Telephone and internet.

185
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.540
- Are you criticizing me? - Yes.

186
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.010
- I'm criticizing you. - Gosh.

187
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.280
This is how Eun Jung reacted.

188
00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:00.549
She can't deny it.

189
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.450
Eun Jung made her debut 17 years ago.

190
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.790
Now, she's hosting four variety shows.

191
00:07:08.359 --> 00:07:09.419
She's hosting more shows than you do.

192
00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.460
- I'm hosting only three. - I'm sorry,

193
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.929
- That's amazing. - but Eun Jung.

194
00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:17.270
- Yes? - Even Jae Seok hosts only three.

195
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.869
- Aren't you hosting too many shows? - In fact,

196
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:21.669
Jae Seok can host 10 shows if he wants.

197
00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:22.669
No, I can't.

198
00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:23.840
The TV stations can't afford him.

199
00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:26.239
He's probably paid a lot.

200
00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:29.080
- But... - I get paid less than Jae Seok.

201
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.580
- "I get paid less." - Yes. I can host 10 shows.

202
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.319
- That's nice. - You speak differently now.

203
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:38.689
I haven't appeared on Happy Together for a while.

204
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:39.819
You haven't been here for a while.

205
00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:41.890
When I was here before,

206
00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.030
- I was quiet. You must remember. - That's right.

207
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.030
Whenever I was asked a question,

208
00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:48.900
I said, "No. I don't know." I spoke like this.

209
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.900
To convince her to dance,

210
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.929
- four people had to work together. - We tried to convince her.

211
00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:54.270
We tried to convince her.

212
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.700
The staff wrote, "Please dance for us" on their board and played music.

213
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.369
Then we said, "Oh, no. Let's do it over again."

214
00:07:58.369 --> 00:08:00.439
But today, she danced while walking into the studio. I was surprised.

215
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.280
- It was hard for me too. - Why?

216
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.410
- I had to hide my charms. - Exactly.

217
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.249
I came on to the show to promote my dramas.

218
00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:10.850
- Your role in the drama... - That's right.

219
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.859
I had to maintain the image of my character.

220
00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.390
So I couldn't show my charms.

221
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.460
I had no choice but to behave quietly.

222
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.489
Why did you change completely?

223
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.100
- I thought I needed to change. - Why?

224
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.330
- Why did you suddenly think of it? - There must've been a reason.

225
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.100
- I wanted to be just who I am. - I see.

226
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.470
- So this is your true self? - Yes.

227
00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:31.739
The people whom she's hosting her shows with are...

228
00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:34.280
- Park Soo Hong, - That's right.

229
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.110
- Kim Gu Ra. - She hosted a show with him.

230
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.380
- She also worked with Lee Sang Min. - Lee Sang Min.

231
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.709
You work with many comedians.

232
00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:42.280
I think I hit it off well with comedians.

233
00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.650
Of course I've been working with a lot of actors and actresses,

234
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.120
but when I say something on a variety show...

235
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.429
I worked with Sae Ho not long ago. We had great teamwork.

236
00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.099
- So I... - She clicks with comedians.

237
00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:56.459
- That's because she's pretty. - once said...

238
00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:57.630
- in the studio... - You two had great teamwork?

239
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.270
- We had great teamwork. - We clicked with each other.

240
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.270
- That rarely happens. - I know. So I told the writer...

241
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.469
that Sae Ho did so well,

242
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:05.240
- and we made a great team. - You complimented him.

243
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.679
I also said that I hoped to have him on "My Unexpected Housemate".

244
00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.380
That's how much I enjoyed working with him.

245
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.079
- I think I click with comedians. - I understand.

246
00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:15.250
All that's left is co-hosting a show with Jae Seok.

247
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.150
Then you will have worked with almost every popular entertainer.

248
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.650
Are you willing to co-host with him?

249
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.650
- With Jae Seok? - Yes.

250
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.719
Of course.

251
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.589
What about Hyeon Gyeong?

252
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.059
- I have no right to decide on that. - That's true.

253
00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:26.790
You choose between us.

254
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.860
Hyeon Gyeong or Eun Jung.

255
00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.030
(The time has come.)

256
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.740
(He can't avoid choosing one of them.)

257
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.140
- Choose. - Should I really do this?

258
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.410
- Of course you should. - Show him why he should choose you.

259
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.439
It's about time for Jae Seok to get into trouble.

260
00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:42.679
- What do you mean? - Why?

261
00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:45.250
- Why? - When he's on his shows,

262
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.280
he's always so considerate of other people.

263
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.880
- Choose between us. - All right.

264
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.990
Let's say you got an offer for a new TV show.

265
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.290
- She's observant. - If you have to choose between...

266
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.490
Eun Jung and Hyeon Gyeong to be your co-host, who would you choose?

267
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.490
- Hyeon Gyeong. - My gosh.

268
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.559
(He answered without hesitating.)

269
00:09:58.429 --> 00:09:59.459
Why?

270
00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:02.329
I've been working with Hyeon Gyeong for a long time.

271
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:04.169
- He has to work with her. - That's right.

272
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.169
- You shouldn't have humiliated her. - She looks furious.

273
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.169
- You asked me to choose. - She's our guest.

274
00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:13.740
She thought he would choose her, so she was waiting.

275
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.679
- But he chose Hyeon Gyeong. - The show just got started.

276
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:16.910
You should've at least pretended to contemplate.

277
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.579
- That was harsh. - I chose Hyeon Gyeong.

278
00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:20.949
- We just began the show. - I said I chose Hyeon Gyeong.

279
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:22.650
- Hyeon Gyeong would... - She wasn't doing anything.

280
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.689
Why?

281
00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.390
- She was confident. - She looks upset.

282
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.020
- Look at her face. - I'm sorry.

283
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.319
- It's because Eun Jung is... - Why did you invite me here?

284
00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.189
That was good.

285
00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:35.699
Since Eun Jung is a very good entertainer,

286
00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:36.760
I knew she'd be cool about it.

287
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.370
I'm not that big-hearted.

288
00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:42.569
I apologize for his behavior. Work with Hyun Moo. He has a lot of work.

289
00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:44.209
- That was funny. - He's hosting a lot of shows.

290
00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:45.669
Now, I'll ask Eun Jung a question.

291
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:48.510
Which one would you choose between me and Hyun Moo?

292
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.579
Hyun Moo.

293
00:10:49.579 --> 00:10:50.650
(Eun Jung chose Hyun Moo.)

294
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.809
- Did you really have to ask? - She is good.

295
00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:53.549
I beat Jae Seok!

296
00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:55.020
- I beat Jae Seok! - Please ask me the question again.

297
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.280
Please ask me the question again.

298
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.490
I choose Hyeon Gyeong.

299
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.490
(He holds grudges.)

300
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.860
- I choose Ji Min. - What?

301
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.860
I refuse.

302
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.919
Okay.

303
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.130
Are variety shows easier...

304
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.530
- than dramas and movies? - I bet they are.

305
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.230
They are stress-free.

306
00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:13.469
They give me time to rest too.

307
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.540
Until recently, we were in a program together.

308
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.669
At first,

309
00:11:18.669 --> 00:11:21.780
she didn't care about the time.

310
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.949
She didn't mind the long shoots.

311
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.709
After she got used to variety shows, she changed.

312
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.120
She would ask upon arrival, "When does the shoot end today?"

313
00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:30.250
- Eun Jung. - She got used to variety shows.

314
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.589
- It gives us a different picture. - She asked that before we began.

315
00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:34.559
- She is female Kim Gu Ra. - That's too much.

316
00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:36.260
The female Lee Gyeong Gyu.

317
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.390
- You put yourself at ease. - When I signed the contract,

318
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.530
I didn't know the shoot would be so long.

319
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.599
It was so long!

320
00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:47.439
- Eun Jung is hilarious. - She really is.

321
00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:50.510
She asked the same question to the writer today.

322
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.839
(She checked the duration of the shoot.)

323
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:54.380
- Really? - She is worse than Yong Man.

324
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.880
Your words don't add up.

325
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.949
This program is no joke!

326
00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:02.679
You are no joke.

327
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.089
I don't like long shoots.

328
00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:06.319
- Really? - Yes.

329
00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:08.089
- I like them short and sweet. - These days,

330
00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:09.620
- you criticize yourself often... - That's hilarious.

331
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.559
- when you are on TV. - Yes.

332
00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.730
I heard that you talk about yourself without realizing it.

333
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.160
- It drives me crazy. - Why?

334
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.799
I lack as an MC.

335
00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:19.969
- That's true. - However...

336
00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:21.939
- Excuse me? - I was joking.

337
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.439
- Are you angry? - You said it yourself.

338
00:12:24.439 --> 00:12:26.010
Stop the shoot.

339
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.980
Eun Jung, I was only agreeing with you.

340
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.179
Please don't misunderstand.

341
00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:32.049
I am beginning to understand...

342
00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:34.250
how hard it is for the MCs.

343
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.120
When you host a program,

344
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.250
you need to extract stories from your guests.

345
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.490
- That's very important. - The guests need to talk.

346
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.760
Because they didn't in my program, the producer told me...

347
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.260
that I hosted the program too rigidly.

348
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.130
It burdened my heart.

349
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.240
It's bound to happen when the production team says that.

350
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.709
I have to make people laugh from time to time.

351
00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:00.140
- That's right. - That's why...

352
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.510
- I end up making fun of myself. - You talk about yourself.

353
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.750
We were talking about malicious comments...

354
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.980
and the emotional scars that come with them.

355
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.719
I said that I had malicious comments about my long face.

356
00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:11.949
I made fun of myself.

357
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:14.260
"Someone wrote that I resemble Yang Sang Gook..."

358
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.559
- "in the comment section." - Really?

359
00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:16.589
- Yes. - I see the resemblance.

360
00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:17.660
I shared...

361
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.530
(She explodes for the 2nd time.)

362
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.660
She is full of anger.

363
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.230
- You said it yourself! - We didn't bring it up.

364
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.199
Hold on. This program is strange.

365
00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:29.270
You said it yourself!

366
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.110
It never occurred to me.

367
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.209
- I didn't know. - Only after hearing her words,

368
00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:33.939
did I realize that there is a resemblance.

369
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.480
I said that on the program.

370
00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:38.849
The next day, it was all over the internet.

371
00:13:38.849 --> 00:13:41.250
People said that we look alike.

372
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.890
Even those who had no idea found out about it.

373
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.490
- We found out about it today. - Seriously.

374
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.290
- I had no idea. - At first...

375
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.819
- I know. - They look alike.

376
00:13:48.819 --> 00:13:50.530
You understand us now that you worked as an MC, right?

377
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.160
You know how hard it is to make the program funny, right?

378
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.660
- Yes. - You may not know that.

379
00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:57.000
(He doesn't know what to say.)

380
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.329
He needs time to understand.

381
00:13:58.329 --> 00:13:59.599
Myung Soo may need time to understand.

382
00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:00.699
You have soft hands.

383
00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:02.839
You haven't struggled a lot.

384
00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:05.040
Why is he patting Jae Seok's hands?

385
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040
(Don't let go of my hand, Jae Seok.)

386
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.110
It's because I love him.

387
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.549
You have been in TV programs with various celebrities...

388
00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:13.549
such as Kim Gu Ra, Lee Sang Min, and Park Soo Hong.

389
00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:16.120
With whom did you have the best teamwork?

390
00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:18.819
Gu Ra is knowledgeable.

391
00:14:18.819 --> 00:14:21.419
Since he knows many things, the conversation goes flawlessly.

392
00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:24.589
- How about Sang Min? - He is incredibly serious.

393
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.500
- Right, kind of unexpected. - He usually doesn't say much,

394
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.799
but once he has something he wants to say,

395
00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:32.530
he talks for too long.

396
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.669
(He can be chatty.)

397
00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:35.169
- He is like that. - He doesn't stop.

398
00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:36.569
No, he doesn't.

399
00:14:36.569 --> 00:14:38.640
As for Soo Hong...

400
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.480
To be honest,

401
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.839
I didn't think Soo Hong was a funny comedian.

402
00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:43.849
(A boring comedian)

403
00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.209
Soo Hong is funny.

404
00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:47.020
Yes. I got to know how funny he is.

405
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.219
That's right.

406
00:14:48.219 --> 00:14:50.219
I have the best teamwork with Soo Hong.

407
00:14:50.219 --> 00:14:51.549
You work better with him than the rest.

408
00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:54.419
Do you find him attractive as a man?

409
00:14:54.819 --> 00:14:56.490
- No, I don't. - You don't.

410
00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.030
Soo Hong revealed his type.

411
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.400
- What's his type? - Women with monolids...

412
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.969
whose eyes crinkle when they smile.

413
00:15:04.969 --> 00:15:06.329
He likes Korean beauties.

414
00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:08.000
He told me that as soon as we met.

415
00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:10.770
- You hadn't asked. - It was like, "You aren't my type."

416
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.469
- He told you that upon meeting. - His type may be the opposite.

417
00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:15.740
That's right. Maybe he tried to make you intrigued.

418
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.510
Maybe he lied to hide how he feels.

419
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.919
Chae Yeon, your mom thinks Soo Hong is a son-in-law material.

420
00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:22.079
Is that true?

421
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:25.319
He appears in a TV program...

422
00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:27.390
- these days. - Yes.

423
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.890
My mom watches it diligently.

424
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.390
Soo Hong caught her eyes...

425
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.599
out of the three people.

426
00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:39.370
She kept asking me, "What do you think? Isn't he nice?"

427
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.599
When Chae Yeon smiles,

428
00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:43.569
- her eyes crinkle, right? - Her eyes crinkle.

429
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.410
Isn't it the same for everyone?

430
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.309
Her eyes crinkle.

431
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:52.480
Don't your mom's words affect you...

432
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.380
even if you weren't interested before?

433
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.349
- People around you... - Those words make you conscious.

434
00:15:56.349 --> 00:15:57.520
- can make you conscious. - My eyes go to him.

435
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.150
- It can't be helped. - That's right.

436
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.390
- What do you think about him? - What do you think?

437
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.919
I wouldn't be averse to seeing him a few times.

438
00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:03.959
Chae Yeon.

439
00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:06.459
If Soo Hong asks to have a dinner with you, would you?

440
00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:08.829
I can have a dinner with him.

441
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:11.429
The decision to date him would come later.

442
00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.270
- That's right. - Spend time with him first.

443
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.900
I am surprised that Chae Yeon's heart is open.

444
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.709
- Her heart is open. - It's not like that.

445
00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:20.640
At my age, my heart should be open to anyone.

446
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.209
- Seriously. - My goodness.

447
00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:25.280
- It's not Soo Hong in particular. - No.

448
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.910
I am in no position to turn people down right away.

449
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.449
Please pick one from Kim Gu Ra, Lee Sang Min, and Park Soo Hong.

450
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:31.250
- That's ridiculous. - Let her answer.

451
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.750
- What? - For goodness' sake.

452
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.419
Please pick one.

453
00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:36.490
I will have dinner with each one...

454
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.030
- before I decide. - I see.

455
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.130
- She is very... - Her heart is open to all ideas.

456
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.160
- That's right. - She did the same to me.

457
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.870
In the waiting room, I asked her, "How did you become so prettier?"

458
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.400
Then she asked, "What do you think about me?"

459
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.000
- Really? - No way.

460
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.640
- Her heart is too wide open. - I told her,

461
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.709
"I am ready."

462
00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:54.809
She went back inside without an answer.

463
00:16:54.809 --> 00:16:55.880
(Chae Yeon only checked how Sae Ho feels.)

464
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.250
How much younger can your partner be?

465
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.910
There is Mi Na, the singer from the World Cup.

466
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.150
Actually...

467
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.579
Why did you bring up Mi Na?

468
00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:03.719
(Myung Soo traveled back in time.)

469
00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:05.319
- The singer from the World Cup! - What was that?

470
00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.319
Why did you bring up Mi Na?

471
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.520
Actually...

472
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.690
She is dating a man who is 17 years younger than her.

473
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.190
That's why I brought her up.

474
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.099
As a joke, I always say that my partner's age doesn't matter...

475
00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.460
as long as he isn't underage.

476
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.329
- It's a joke. - It's a joke.

477
00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.399
Can you date Sae Ho?

478
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.240
Of course I can.

479
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.839
I really like Sae Ho.

480
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.869
(She is incredibly honest.)

481
00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.309
- Sae Ho. - However, I don't like the way...

482
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:27.639
he makes a move on everyone.

483
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.309
- I am only trying to be funny. - He should be more serious.

484
00:17:30.309 --> 00:17:32.549
Anyway, I heard that...

485
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:35.049
- Ji Min became surprised... - Did it really happen?

486
00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:36.619
when she drank with Chae Yeon.

487
00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:38.319
After the first shoot for our program,

488
00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:40.290
we had drinks.

489
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.359
We got drunk and began to talk about men and relationships.

490
00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.089
"Ji Min, aren't you going to meet someone?"

491
00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:47.899
"I want to focus on my work."

492
00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:50.200
"I can meet someone..."

493
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.500
"later in my life." Then she said,

494
00:17:52.629 --> 00:17:54.869
"You will end up like me at that rate."

495
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.869
- Did you really say that? - She let go of herself.

496
00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:01.809
I said, "Someone will show up in the future."

497
00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:03.909
She said, "I am your future."

498
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.950
(Self-destruction)

499
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.119
- Chae Yeon. - Yes?

500
00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.649
You spoke too harshly.

501
00:18:08.849 --> 00:18:12.020
When Ji Min said that,

502
00:18:12.389 --> 00:18:13.520
I agreed with her.

503
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.290
- I like working. - That's right.

504
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.460
When I was busy with work, I had plenty...

505
00:18:19.129 --> 00:18:20.190
You had plenty of men.

506
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.859
You had plenty of men 10 years ago.

507
00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:24.970
- I guess it's all in the past. - "Plenty of men".

508
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.599
- That's right. - It's all in the past.

509
00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:29.170
"Whom should I ask to drive me home today?"

510
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.909
I did that.

511
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.680
- She is honest. - I didn't date all of them.

512
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.710
- They were just... - You flirted with them.

513
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.180
- I flirted with them. - Some with good feelings.

514
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.180
I thought I would always have a lot of men by my side.

515
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.750
- However... - Don't you still have...

516
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.089
a lot of men?

517
00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:47.260
After I turned 30,

518
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.490
the number dropped exponentially.

519
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.230
- Really? - I am serious.

520
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.629
- Really? - "Exponentially".

521
00:18:52.629 --> 00:18:55.460
- A lot of them got married. - "Where did everyone go?"

522
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.500
It suddenly became that way.

523
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.329
I bet there are still a lot of men...

524
00:18:59.329 --> 00:19:02.270
- by Chae Yeon's side. - The one who drives her home now...

525
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.940
- is a chauffeur. - He's right.

526
00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.710
A chauffeur or a manager.

527
00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:11.450
Ji Min, you have a story about a chauffeur.

528
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.349
Since I plan to live a long life,

529
00:19:15.349 --> 00:19:19.619
I do my best to avoid troubles and accidents.

530
00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:22.659
That's why I often call a chauffeur.

531
00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:24.559
I called a chauffeur that day.

532
00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:27.599
Upon hearing that he has come, I went out.

533
00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:30.099
However, we couldn't find my car.

534
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.700
We looked for an hour.

535
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.230
- You looked with the chauffeur. - Yes.

536
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.540
Although we looked for an hour, we couldn't find the car.

537
00:19:35.899 --> 00:19:37.710
"Did it get stolen? What should I do?"

538
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.839
It turns out I hadn't brought the car that day.

539
00:19:40.139 --> 00:19:41.980
You called the chauffeur out of a habit.

540
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.180
- I did it out of a habit. - Don't call a chauffeur...

541
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.379
when you didn't bring the car.

542
00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:46.649
"Since I drank, I must call the chauffeur."

543
00:19:46.649 --> 00:19:48.980
- You did it out of a habit. - That's right.

544
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.220
- My goodness. - It's a good habit.

545
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.290
It's a good habit.

546
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.119
- I felt so bad. - You know a lot about Ji Min.

547
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.559
Are you flaunting how close the two of you are?

548
00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:57.089
You talked over her.

549
00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:58.359
Are you carrying her backpack?

550
00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:00.030
- What are you doing? - I am sorry to cut you off...

551
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.099
I am not carrying her backpack.

552
00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:02.730
Ji Min, I am sorry to cut you off,

553
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.030
- but the two of you met again. - Yes.

554
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.099
I wanted to know how it feels.

555
00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:07.700
- Would you stop hosting the show? - Why are you hosting the show?

556
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.069
I wasn't hosting the show.

557
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.569
Why are you hosting the show?

558
00:20:11.569 --> 00:20:14.809
Some people wonder if the rumor made the two of you grow distant.

559
00:20:14.809 --> 00:20:16.079
There was a rumor about the two of you dating.

560
00:20:16.079 --> 00:20:18.549
Being cautious around each other...

561
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:20.549
- made us grow distant. - Really?

562
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:21.920
Recently,

563
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.790
I ranked men who were rumored...

564
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.659
to be my boyfriend.

565
00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:31.359
1st was Heo Kyung Hwan and 2nd was Hyun Moo.

566
00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:34.030
I received a text from Hyun Moo when the episode aired.

567
00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.899
"Why am I second?"

568
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.000
(Clingy)

569
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.399
That's pathetic.

570
00:20:39.399 --> 00:20:41.270
You don't let go.

571
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.399
- You don't let go. - I was joking.

572
00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:44.940
He wasn't joking.

573
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.510
I replied, "It was a joke."

574
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.579
- He read it but didn't reply. - "No replies".

575
00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:51.879
I hated that Heo Kyung Hwan was top one.

576
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:56.420
Ji Min's ideal type used to be a smart man.

577
00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.950
I heard that's not the case anymore.

578
00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.389
Smart men are cool and sexy.

579
00:21:01.389 --> 00:21:03.020
- That's right. - I see.

580
00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.230
Ever since I met Hyun Moo,

581
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.329
I don't like men who know they are smart.

582
00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:10.030
That's right.

583
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.030
Men who try hard to look smart...

584
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.670
- no longer appeal to me. - Is Hyun Moo like that?

585
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.470
- What was that? - Why are you doing that?

586
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.909
Why did you gesture to me like this?

587
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:18.909
You know,

588
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:22.639
even when they don't try to act smart,

589
00:21:22.639 --> 00:21:24.579
- smart men exude knowledge. - That's right.

590
00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:25.680
I am worried it won't show.

591
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.909
Instead of exuding knowledge, but dredges it up.

592
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:29.349
- He dredges it up. - By himself.

593
00:21:29.349 --> 00:21:31.750
- He dredges up his knowledge. - I flaunt it.

594
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.220
He flaunts it.

595
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.420
For men, action should come before words.

596
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.790
There is no need to act smart.

597
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.230
When men solve a problem at a critical moment,

598
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.700
women will go crazy.

599
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.629
- How did this come about? - He is talking about himself.

600
00:21:43.629 --> 00:21:45.030
- I have no idea. - You talked...

601
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.770
- about yourself, right? - I thought he was sleep talking.

602
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.339
It was a monodrama.

603
00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.309
When you do something like that, the production crew goes crazy.

604
00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:54.109
- Give me the spotlight. - Spotlight!

605
00:21:54.109 --> 00:21:56.109
It's a lonely day.

606
00:21:56.109 --> 00:21:59.049
Your ideal type isn't a smart man.

607
00:21:59.049 --> 00:22:01.049
I like a smart man who doesn't act smart.

608
00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:04.149
- A man who doesn't act smart. - Ji Min likes it...

609
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:07.290
when a man answers her question,

610
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.460
not when he goes on and on about something she didn't ask.

611
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.059
- She doesn't like a braggart. - Right.

612
00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:15.460
- Is Hyun Moo like that? - This isn't about me.

613
00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:17.730
Why are you picking on me? I am not like that.

614
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.730
- I don't know much. - I didn't think you were like that.

615
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.540
Hyun Moo always does this.

616
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.470
If he is wearing a new outfit, he goes,

617
00:22:23.639 --> 00:22:26.010
"You don't know this brand, do you?"

618
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.240
That's the worst.

619
00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:29.609
(Helplessness)

620
00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:31.680
You should have kept the brand to yourself.

621
00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:34.849
- Hyun Moo is like that. - You must hate coming to the shoot.

622
00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.680
(He can't redeem himself.)

623
00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:39.420
- You like smart men. - I like smart men.

624
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.619
I like it when they explain things from a field I am not familiar with.

625
00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:46.030
Despite his image on TV, Hyun Moo is a good man.

626
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.230
He is a very good man.

627
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.430
He is polite, smart, and hardworking.

628
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.030
He is the light man.

629
00:22:51.129 --> 00:22:54.069
- "The light man"? - You mean "The right man".

630
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.670
- What makes him the light man? - I don't know what to say.

631
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.770
He is the light man of Happy Together.

632
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.409
- The light man. - That's great.

633
00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:06.750
Eun Jung, you mistakenly thought that an actor likes you.

634
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.649
- He didn't like you. - This sounds like a fun story.

635
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.780
This sounds like a fun story.

636
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.250
Eun Jung, what happened?

637
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:17.829
When there are men around me, I keep my guards up.

638
00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:18.930
(She turns on her radar.)

639
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.530
When I was in a drama,

640
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.599
I thought someone was showing his interest.

641
00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:27.770
- Right. - "Have you eaten?"

642
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.940
He brought me coffee...

643
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.569
and asked to have a meal with him after the shoot.

644
00:23:31.569 --> 00:23:33.639
That seems like...

645
00:23:33.639 --> 00:23:35.579
It sounds like he was making a move.

646
00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:40.280
I thought to myself, "He is interested in me."

647
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.389
One day, I saw him ask another actress to eat with him.

648
00:23:44.389 --> 00:23:46.220
I thought to myself,

649
00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:49.520
"He must be embarrassed to eat alone with me."

650
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.059
- You began to write a story. - She began to justify herself.

651
00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:56.530
- She began to write a story. - You thought he likes you.

652
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.030
I thought he asked another actress to join...

653
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.639
to create comfortable atmosphere.

654
00:24:01.639 --> 00:24:03.470
We ate together.

655
00:24:03.639 --> 00:24:08.040
- I feigned disinterest... - I see.

656
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.710
in front of him.

657
00:24:10.139 --> 00:24:12.549
A month later, the two of them began to date.

658
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.520
(She was back-stabbed.)

659
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.780
No way!

660
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.819
- That's incredible. - When that happened,

661
00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:22.720
I felt so disappointed.

662
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.359
- It's understandable. - I see.

663
00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:27.299
- I had my hopes up. - That's right.

664
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.629
They called you over...

665
00:24:28.629 --> 00:24:31.599
- so that they can meet comfortably. - I was the bait.

666
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.470
- It was the other way around. - Yes.

667
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.740
You have know-how of keeping a relationship secret...

668
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.940
that involves body language.

669
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.440
When I go somewhere,

670
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.849
- people recognize me by my voice. - Right.

671
00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:45.579
- I had the same thought. - Her voice is distinct.

672
00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:48.149
- You have a distinct voice. - Really?

673
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:52.349
I think people won't recognize me. When I say "Hello,"

674
00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:53.859
- people recognize me. - Right.

675
00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:55.260
Why don't you act it out?

676
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.059
It doesn't matter if I wear sunglasses and a hat.

677
00:24:58.329 --> 00:25:00.159
"What should we eat?" Then people know who I am.

678
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.000
- I know why. - People recognize me by my voice.

679
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.470
I thought people recognize me by my face.

680
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.139
You have a long face.

681
00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:10.309
Your chin sticks out when you wear a mask.

682
00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:11.740
- Why don't you wear two masks? - My face...

683
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.980
Maybe people recognize me by my long face.

684
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.680
(Hide your chin.)

685
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.149
- Your chin sticks out. - Yes.

686
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:19.309
A mask isn't big enough to cover my chin.

687
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:21.349
Even though she is an actress, she makes fun of herself.

688
00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:23.750
- That's not easy. - She is perfect for variety shows.

689
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.750
People recognize me by my voice.

690
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.389
You do have a unique voice.

691
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:30.960
I decided to conceal my voice...

692
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.760
if I am in a relationship.

693
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.329
That's why I use body language for everything.

694
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.500
- How? - For an example...

695
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.629
Try, "Give me a cup of coffee."

696
00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:41.299
I can order iced Americano with a lot of ice...

697
00:25:41.299 --> 00:25:43.139
- and accumulate points, - How do you do that?

698
00:25:43.139 --> 00:25:44.940
- for an example. - Can you do that?

699
00:25:45.139 --> 00:25:46.339
How do you do that with body language?

700
00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:48.409
- Can you do that? - Give it a try.

701
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.210
(It begins.)

702
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.980
What do you want to drink?

703
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.280
(She moves her hands diligently.)

704
00:25:55.879 --> 00:25:58.750
- Did you get it? - What did you say?

705
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.690
- I can do it again. - I see.

706
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.859
You have bad teeth.

707
00:26:02.059 --> 00:26:03.059
(He failed to comprehend.)

708
00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:05.530
- Is that what you said? - Is this "Family Arcade"?

709
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.559
- Let's try it again. - This is like a game.

710
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.129
(Make a guess.)

711
00:26:11.129 --> 00:26:12.829
- "I have bad teeth." - "I have bad teeth."

712
00:26:12.829 --> 00:26:14.139
(Make a guess.)

713
00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:15.670
- "Jaw". - "You need magnesium."

714
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.670
Iced Americano.

715
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.040
(What's the answer?)

716
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.510
I want iced Americano with ice and two shots.

717
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.010
I will pay by card and accumulate points.

718
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.750
Your boyfriend needs to understand it.

719
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.149
Two shots.

720
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:28.649
You said that you cover your mouth.

721
00:26:28.649 --> 00:26:30.389
- This is hard. - I take off my mask for this.

722
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:32.290
It's hard to be her boyfriend.

723
00:26:32.849 --> 00:26:35.690
Why don't you give us a problem...

724
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.290
- without saying anything? - We'll try again.

725
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.930
- Don't say anything. - This is too easy.

726
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.700
- This is a quiz. - I will give you a quiz.

727
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.030
Okay.

728
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.040
Okay.

729
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.940
"Don't say a word about the fact that I drank."

730
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.240
Water...

731
00:26:51.839 --> 00:26:52.869
What?

732
00:26:53.639 --> 00:26:55.480
What was that?

733
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.210
"Don't say a word about the fact..."

734
00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.149
- "that I drank." - "that I drank."

735
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:01.149
- I'm sorry. - "Shut your mouth."

736
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:03.920
My hand gesture was off.

737
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.490
- It looked like soju. - That's right.

738
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.059
- Try it again. - Cue.

739
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.520
"I am hungry."

740
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.329
(They watch her again.)

741
00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:11.960
- I figured it out. - What?

742
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.129
"I want water and tissue."

743
00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:16.200
That's right.

744
00:27:16.329 --> 00:27:18.470
- "I want water." - "I want water."

745
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.399
"I need water and napkin."

746
00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:23.839
You want two items.

747
00:27:24.139 --> 00:27:27.639
You need many skills to go out with Eun Jung.

748
00:27:27.639 --> 00:27:30.139
- It's like a different language. - There must be a connection.

749
00:27:30.139 --> 00:27:32.109
- He needs wits. - That's right.

750
00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:36.680
I can never go out with someone who is as senseless as Myung Soo.

751
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.049
- He needs to get punched. - Exactly.

752
00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:42.790
- We are talking about many topics. - It was quite fun.

753
00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.889
Jung Chae Yeon became...

754
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.700
- the icon of first love. - I see.

755
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.260
- She succeeded Suzy. - That's right.

756
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.000
She is in a drama with Yeo Jin Goo.

757
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.069
You are the same age as Yeo Jin Goo.

758
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.940
Yes. Both of us were born in 1997.

759
00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.369
How was it to act with Yeo Jin Goo?

760
00:27:58.409 --> 00:28:00.639
He gave me a lot of trust.

761
00:28:00.639 --> 00:28:03.480
He has a lot of experiences in acting.

762
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.379
I was unfamiliar with the set.

763
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.849
When I didn't know what to do,

764
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.889
he thought out a scene with me.

765
00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:14.960
I depended on him a lot.

766
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.460
I watched the drama.

767
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.460
A scene in which he carries you on his back was memorable.

768
00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:23.869
The shoot took place late at night.

769
00:28:23.899 --> 00:28:26.500
I only had to pretend to sleep on his back,

770
00:28:26.629 --> 00:28:29.200
- but he had to carry me. - That's right.

771
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.309
I felt really bad.

772
00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:33.980
It must have been physically exhausting.

773
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.649
I said, "I am not very heavy."

774
00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.480
- "My weight..." - This is...

775
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.450
- It's like a line from a drama. - Most people say the opposite.

776
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.149
- I know. - It's like a line from a drama.

777
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:45.690
Then he said,

778
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:50.760
"I worked out a lot. I can carry you."

779
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.260
It's like a line from a drama about first love.

780
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.460
Seriously.

781
00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.000
- I should write it down. - It's a drama.

782
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.629
Actors are like that. They are different from comedians.

783
00:28:59.629 --> 00:29:01.200
- What makes you say that? - Comedians go,

784
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.339
"You are heavier than I imagined." Then they throw you off.

785
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.639
- Actors are cool. - It must make your heart flutter.

786
00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:10.750
The two Chae Yeons...

787
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.280
prepared something for Happy Together.

788
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.220
- Really? - They will dance to "Two of Us".

789
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.220
Jung Chae Yeon and Chae Yeon will perform.

790
00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:21.460
Let's go.

791
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.159
(Get ready.)

792
00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:27.559
(It’s part of the lyric from Chae Yeon's hit song.)

793
00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:28.559
(Let's go!)

794
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.829
(They are in sync.)

795
00:29:31.829 --> 00:29:33.030
This is great.

796
00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:37.440
(They exude fresh and pure charms.)

797
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440
(Let's go!)

798
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.540
What's that?

799
00:29:40.609 --> 00:29:42.710
(Jung Chae Yeon and Chae Yeon's collaborative performance)

800
00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:46.049
(They don't disappoint.)

801
00:29:46.049 --> 00:29:48.049
- They can dance well. - They are like sisters.

802
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:49.450
- Seriously. - Exactly.

803
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.349
Both of them can dance well.

804
00:29:51.349 --> 00:29:52.649
(Please make a duo.)

805
00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:54.659
I met Chae Yeon for the first time today.

806
00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:56.220
I heard a lot about her.

807
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.930
- What did you hear? - I heard that she is very nice.

808
00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.659
- That's right. - I heard that...

809
00:29:59.659 --> 00:30:02.829
she is nice and popular among men.

810
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.270
Did you plan this conversation during the break?

811
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.740
- It's not in the script. - Was it obvious?

812
00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:11.240
This is "Online Girlfriend Special".

813
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.309
I heard that Eun Jung is very generous.

814
00:30:13.309 --> 00:30:15.010
- It's a well-known fact. - Right.

815
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.980
When her manager got married, she gave him a foreign car,

816
00:30:18.109 --> 00:30:20.250
a watch, clothes,

817
00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:22.149
as well as a money gift of 5,000 dollars.

818
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.750
You even welcomed the guests with the family at the wedding.

819
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.720
Yes. He knows a lot of my faults.

820
00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:31.559
You had to be nice to him.

821
00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:33.589
I had to silence him.

822
00:30:33.589 --> 00:30:37.470
She has worked with that manager for more than 10 years.

823
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.569
- That's right. - That's impressive.

824
00:30:38.569 --> 00:30:40.099
How long has it been?

825
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.639
We have worked together for 12 years.

826
00:30:42.639 --> 00:30:45.139
- It has been long. - Eun Jung is loyal.

827
00:30:45.139 --> 00:30:48.809
There are people I like or take under my wings.

828
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.710
- I go all out for them. - We should be friends.

829
00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:55.349
I heard his agent left us a comment.

830
00:30:55.349 --> 00:30:58.290
He told us that he lets Eun Jung do whatever she wants.

831
00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:00.659
- He even lets her cursing slide. - I see.

832
00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:03.020
- She pays him on time. - I...

833
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.030
She pays him on time.

834
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.930
- I... - You're never late.

835
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.859
- After the episode aired, - Yes.

836
00:31:07.859 --> 00:31:10.200
I earned this reputation of a swearing lady. I'm serious.

837
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.639
People asked me if I was that good at swearing at my agent.

838
00:31:13.639 --> 00:31:15.740
- I actually did it to be funny. - I see.

839
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.440
But you did curse at him, didn't you?

840
00:31:17.869 --> 00:31:20.309
- Her agent... - Did you check the facts?

841
00:31:20.309 --> 00:31:21.980
- It's because they are close. - Right.

842
00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.909
I mean, Myung Soo does the same thing, right?

843
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:25.480
They swear at each other, so no harm done.

844
00:31:25.879 --> 00:31:27.920
- His agent badmouths him a lot. - It's a two-way street.

845
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.950
(They are even.)

846
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.049
We will live a long life.

847
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:31.950
(We hope your friendship never falters.)

848
00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:35.520
- You had mood swings in your 20s. - I did.

849
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.089
So you said that your agent had a hard time.

850
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.859
I mean, I was young at that time.

851
00:31:40.859 --> 00:31:44.770
- I understand. - I didn't know when I worked a lot.

852
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.069
That's why my agent's job could have been harder.

853
00:31:48.069 --> 00:31:49.700
- But he cut me some slack. - I bet it was tough.

854
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.869
Now, after all these years, I realized that...

855
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:56.040
I'm quite sorry to my agent.

856
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.680
- You're sorry after 12 years? - You're too late.

857
00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.809
I have grown up after 12 years.

858
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.990
- Earlier, her agent said... - I tortured him for last 12 years.

859
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.659
- Did you cry when he got married? - Yes?

860
00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:08.659
(He's her agent of 12 years.)

861
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.490
- How was it? - I did cry.

862
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.700
- It felt like my brother's wedding. - I could understand that.

863
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.829
I see why she'd feel that way.

864
00:32:14.829 --> 00:32:17.170
To whom did you give the biggest cash gift for weddings?

865
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.629
- It's Jae Seok. - I see. How much did you give him?

866
00:32:19.869 --> 00:32:21.339
- I think it was quite sizable. - So how much?

867
00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:23.069
Jae Seok gave me a generous amount.

868
00:32:23.069 --> 00:32:25.339
- I gave him slightly more. - He did.

869
00:32:25.339 --> 00:32:27.240
He saw it as a payment for his insurance.

870
00:32:27.609 --> 00:32:29.409
- He didn't have any choice. - Insurance for his job.

871
00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:31.149
I'm always grateful and sorry to him.

872
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.379
When I saw how much he gave me, I thought about returning it.

873
00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:34.879
I thought about returning it.

874
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.849
- To Myung Soo? - I felt uncomfortable about it.

875
00:32:37.849 --> 00:32:40.089
I thought that Myung Soo went out of his way for the gift.

876
00:32:40.089 --> 00:32:43.159
- Will you give a lot for Hyun Moo? - Of course.

877
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.129
(When they let down their guard...)

878
00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.559
- Of course. - I must give a lot for Hyun Moo's.

879
00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:48.030
- Do you mean it? - Yes. I ought to.

880
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.230
People follow the 3-5-7 rule.

881
00:32:49.399 --> 00:32:51.670
I thought I was on Eun Jung's talk show.

882
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.670
Is it 30-50-70 dollars rule?

883
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.569
- You three are the guests. - Exactly.

884
00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.470
- That's why a while ago, - This is Eun Jung's talk show.

885
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.770
I really thought it was "Eun Jung's Salon".

886
00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.809
(Welcome to "Eun Jung's Salon".)

887
00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:02.079
- We are at Eun Jung's Salon. - This isn't a salon.

888
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.280
I like the ambience of this place.

889
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.809
You said earlier that the ambience wasn't great. Now, it's good?

890
00:33:06.809 --> 00:33:09.420
- I told you she has mood swings. - I see. Mood swings.

891
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.589
I think her agent did deserve to get those pays.

892
00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:13.790
Thinking back, I forget to ask her this question.

893
00:33:14.089 --> 00:33:16.190
I'm curious about your dating life.

894
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.730
Are you guys currently in a relationship?

895
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.359
You dated your last boyfriend six years ago?

896
00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:22.030
It hasn't been six years yet.

897
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.129
It's been about five years?

898
00:33:24.129 --> 00:33:26.129
- That was a long time ago. - It's been four years.

899
00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:28.770
You have some gone on some dates though, right?

900
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.609
I didn't go on many dates though.

901
00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:34.109
I was very busy with work in China for three years.

902
00:33:34.109 --> 00:33:35.409
I never had a chance to go out.

903
00:33:35.409 --> 00:33:37.780
- Ja Hyun and Xiaoguang got married. - That's right.

904
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.750
- I'm envious of them. - They're the Korea-China couple.

905
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.750
Didn't Chinese celebrities court you?

906
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.649
- Did they when you were in China? - I heard many were interested.

907
00:33:44.649 --> 00:33:46.349
I could have had flings.

908
00:33:46.349 --> 00:33:49.990
A guy from my first drama showed that he was interested in me.

909
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.190
- There was a guy? - Yes.

910
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.389
But I couldn't speak Chinese back then.

911
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:54.399
(The language barrier)

912
00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.629
It was hard to communicate. When we tried to talk, we had to...

913
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:58.970
- use dictionaries or phones. - How unfortunate.

914
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:02.270
- It was so hard. - How did he show his interest?

915
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.010
My curiosity is getting better of me.

916
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.139
When I was filming my scene at the shoot,

917
00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:07.980
he would come to me after his scene.

918
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.809
- Did he look at you? - Yes, he did.

919
00:34:09.809 --> 00:34:11.150
Do you know these gestures?

920
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.349
When I blow him a kiss, he would take it and eat it.

921
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:15.520
- He showed endearments. - He ate your kiss?

922
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.420
At the shoot?

923
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.150
- It must've been packed. - I bet people were there.

924
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.889
No, we were just goofing around.

925
00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:22.960
Everyone was aware that...

926
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.090
this actor publicly named me as my fan.

927
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.960
I mean, I didn't know a lot at that time.

928
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.699
- It was my first drama in China. - I see.

929
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.969
- Actors have their own chairs. - Right.

930
00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.940
At first, I didn't even have one.

931
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.840
- I had to buy and get it delivered. - That's right.

932
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.880
Since I didn't know, he ordered it for me.

933
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.550
- He was very considerate. - You must've felt reassured.

934
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.809
- Yes, but... - I bet.

935
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.820
we couldn't talk to each other when we were sitting down together.

936
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.250
The interpreter had to be here for us to talk.

937
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.889
So it didn't work out. After him, well...

938
00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.320
I heard that you are so lonely...

939
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.659
that when you get sleep paralysis,

940
00:34:58.659 --> 00:35:00.529
- you're reassured. - My goodness.

941
00:35:00.529 --> 00:35:02.230
- But it's a nightmare. - No, that...

942
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.529
Well, it could be because I'm lonely.

943
00:35:04.529 --> 00:35:08.599
when I was sleeping, I was facing the wall one night.

944
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.340
I know before I get sleep paralysis.

945
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.540
- "It's here." - "What should I?" I felt it.

946
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.679
But all of a sudden,

947
00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:18.210
When you get a massage, you get...

948
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.750
- this nice feeling of thrill. - Yes, I know what it is.

949
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.520
I got the goosebumps with that feeling from my toes.

950
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.460
- It felt like someone touching me. - Right, right.

951
00:35:29.989 --> 00:35:31.529
I thought, "What is this?"

952
00:35:32.929 --> 00:35:34.699
(Excuse me?)

953
00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:36.329
Why are you feeling it?

954
00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:39.929
What kind of dream did you have?

955
00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:43.770
It felt like someone was warmly hugging me from the back.

956
00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:46.369
- That's a new one I haven't heard. - How unique.

957
00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:48.380
So after I had that dream,

958
00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.110
- it wasn't hard to wake up from. - Is that so?

959
00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.579
After I wake up from sleep paralysis,

960
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.279
I said, "What is this dream? Why am I feeling like this?"

961
00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:57.949
- Are you sure it was a lucid dream? - Yes.

962
00:35:57.949 --> 00:36:00.190
- I don't think so. - Usually, those dreams are scary.

963
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.820
My friends told me that it must have been a guy.

964
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.860
- You said you had a similar dream. - I get sleep paralysis often.

965
00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:06.630
- It was the same dream. - My goodness.

966
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.860
- Someone was touching me. - Right?

967
00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.469
- Someone was softly touching me. - He was stroking my hair.

968
00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.230
- My gosh. - The moment I got it...

969
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.040
Usually, I would try to wake up from it, but I thought,

970
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.009
"Should I let it continue?"

971
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.880
(Get a grip!)

972
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.409
I'm serious.

973
00:36:23.409 --> 00:36:26.250
My goodness. What kind of dream is it? Why is everyone...

974
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.219
It feels like someone is blowing on my neck.

975
00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:31.989
- Are you sure no one was there? - She really might be lonely.

976
00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:35.389
I have never had a similar dream. So I don't know what it is.

977
00:36:35.389 --> 00:36:37.159
- I get it often. - My gosh.

978
00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:39.989
You heard them talking so far. What about you, Chae Yeon?

979
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:43.329
It's not easy for you to date now, is it?

980
00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:46.570
Didn't your agency ban you from dating?

981
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.099
"I don't think you should be dating now."

982
00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:53.779
"I think you should focus on work now." That's what he said.

983
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.440
- So I think I'm not allowed to. - That means...

984
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.550
But from what I heard, regardless of their permission or not,

985
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.679
- people still dated. - Of course.

986
00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:02.550
- They had their own means, right? - Exactly.

987
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.820
- I host the show with idol singers. - The national holidays are nearing.

988
00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.320
- Right. - When I host, I can spot them.

989
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.559
- Singers like Lee Teuk, Shin Dong, - I heard they can spot everyone.

990
00:37:10.559 --> 00:37:14.400
or Apink don't care about that. They have fun with each other.

991
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.300
- They just... - They have a good time.

992
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.230
They have a blast. But singers in their 3rd or 4th year...

993
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.699
I mean, they are getting popular. I can spot some of them.

994
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.340
They think they're exchanging eye contacts in secret.

995
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.110
When I look at them from the top, I see them looking at each other.

996
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.480
- I knew it. - They keep looking at each other...

997
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.650
- with people around them. - That's right.

998
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.110
I'd just observe them, and Lee Teuk would say,

999
00:37:33.579 --> 00:37:34.880
"They are definitely dating."

1000
00:37:35.949 --> 00:37:36.989
He'd tell me that

1001
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.820
If we were all in the same place, it'd be hard to notice.

1002
00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.020
- But from the above... - Seriously.

1003
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.259
- If I spill, there will be a chaos. - They may be looking at each other.

1004
00:37:44.259 --> 00:37:46.029
- I should be careful too. - They might send signals too.

1005
00:37:46.029 --> 00:37:47.929
- "I should be careful too"? - They send secret signals,

1006
00:37:47.929 --> 00:37:50.230
- but I can see everything. - Why must you be careful, Sae Ho?

1007
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.630
It's always better to be cautious.

1008
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.940
- You're not on the show though. - He thinks he must be careful.

1009
00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.670
- Even if I'm not on it, - Right. You're not on it.

1010
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.409
I don't want to reveal my heart on this show.

1011
00:38:00.409 --> 00:38:01.809
I guess my radar about that is nonexistent.

1012
00:38:01.809 --> 00:38:04.380
When Jae Seok and his wife were dating,

1013
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.980
I really had no clue.

1014
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.179
Ms. Bong Choon.

1015
00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:08.550
Yes, this is in-house broadcasting.

1016
00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:09.750
She sounds nervous.

1017
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.590
You really didn't know?

1018
00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:14.489
When they talked to each other on the show, I was clueless.

1019
00:38:14.489 --> 00:38:16.520
- We weren't dating then. - I see.

1020
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.190
- You weren't dating then? - Then you were right.

1021
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.759
- You were right. - I see.

1022
00:38:21.759 --> 00:38:23.529
- It wasn't that you were clueless. - They weren't dating.

1023
00:38:23.529 --> 00:38:26.029
- You dated after the show? I see. - Yes.

1024
00:38:26.029 --> 00:38:27.099
My goodness.

1025
00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:30.239
After appearing on a dating show, on the plane-ride back,

1026
00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:32.969
I heard that a guy interlocked his fingers.

1027
00:38:32.969 --> 00:38:34.880
- What? - He interlocked his fingers?

1028
00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.710
- Yes. - How was I in the dark about this?

1029
00:38:38.179 --> 00:38:39.409
- I knew nothing. - You only worked.

1030
00:38:39.409 --> 00:38:42.020
- But during the filming, - Yes.

1031
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.119
they showed a lot of interest in a playful manner.

1032
00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:46.290
- Those two... - Who are they?

1033
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.420
- Who are they? I'm curious. - "He's interested in her!"

1034
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.360
He would tease the other guy for fun.

1035
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.759
Try to focus. Can't you remember? He said, "He's interested in her!"

1036
00:38:52.759 --> 00:38:54.259
- No. - It didn't happen during the shoot.

1037
00:38:54.259 --> 00:38:57.000
It was when we were moving to another place.

1038
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.099
We would walk together to the places.

1039
00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:02.469
We settled that we are going to be good friends to each other.

1040
00:39:02.469 --> 00:39:04.670
I was sleeping on the flight back.

1041
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.869
I had the blanket over me while I was sleeping.

1042
00:39:07.409 --> 00:39:09.540
He kept holding my hand.

1043
00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:13.349
But I didn't want to retract my hand.

1044
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:16.219
- Why didn't I know about this? - No one could have known this.

1045
00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:17.520
I was on that flight.

1046
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.550
You didn't sit next to her. How could you have known?

1047
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.460
- Right. - She was on my team too.

1048
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.719
(Jae Seok wasn't in on this.)

1049
00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:25.329
- My gosh. - I didn't know about that.

1050
00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:28.360
- People must be diligent to do it. - It gave my heart a flutter.

1051
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.900
- But you never went out with him? - What if he was a player?

1052
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.130
- Or did you break up with him? - Eun Jung was listening and said,

1053
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.300
"What if he was a player?"

1054
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.469
(Jae Seok catches Eun Jung.)

1055
00:39:35.469 --> 00:39:38.469
Oh, right. So he could've done the same on a different flight?

1056
00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:41.139
- Did he like interlocking fingers? - He liked interlocking fingers?

1057
00:39:41.139 --> 00:39:42.809
Myung Soo thinks the guy liked interlocking fingers.

1058
00:39:42.809 --> 00:39:45.079
But Myung Soo, I heard when you first met your wife,

1059
00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:46.579
you didn't hold her hand.

1060
00:39:46.579 --> 00:39:48.320
- He interlocked his fingers first. - Who are you talking about?

1061
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.590
- Myung Soo. - Could he be a player?

1062
00:39:50.949 --> 00:39:52.550
(Unable to speak)

1063
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.690
That was the funniest remark you mad today.

1064
00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.329
- I bet he's a player. - She doesn't trust easily.

1065
00:39:57.329 --> 00:39:59.590
- Even if I am one, I got married. - I see.

1066
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:01.699
- I knew I had to make her mind. - But...

1067
00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:04.770
I don't know who held Chae Yeon's hand, but my goodness.

1068
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.730
I hadn't had the faintest idea that happened.

1069
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:09.400
I bet there were more guys who tried to make a move on you.

1070
00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:12.040
- Here's another one. - What is it this time?

1071
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.279
- She's going to tell us everything. - It's all in the past.

1072
00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:17.050
- Then why didn't you tell me? - It happened three years ago.

1073
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.809
- You didn't ask. - Right, I didn't.

1074
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.579
- Tell us one more. - Yes, please.

1075
00:40:21.579 --> 00:40:25.119
On the show, guys stood on one side, and girls the other side.

1076
00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:28.619
- We had to flirt with each other. - Yes, that's right.

1077
00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:31.059
We I starred with close friends, we made a promise to each other.

1078
00:40:31.059 --> 00:40:33.829
- We promised to choose each other. - Really?

1079
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:36.059
- Sometimes, there's a surprise. - What is it? What?

1080
00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:37.929
I promised to choose this friend.

1081
00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:41.969
- But someone would choose me. - Someone you never had in mind.

1082
00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:43.969
They had a race while coming to my spot.

1083
00:40:43.969 --> 00:40:46.270
At that moment, I had no choice but to pick the new guy.

1084
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.139
- The new guy was that desperate. - He was aggressive.

1085
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.409
I had promised to choose my friend.

1086
00:40:51.409 --> 00:40:53.550
So I didn't know what I should do.

1087
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:57.150
I ended up making the choice with a fluttered heart.

1088
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:58.349
- That's good. - Yes.

1089
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:59.420
- What did you do then? - Did you betray your friend?

1090
00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.059
- I ended up choosing the new guy. - You chose the new guy.

1091
00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:03.829
- Why did you do that? - What would your friend do?

1092
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:05.630
I couldn't think about my friend.

1093
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.630
(I don't care.)

1094
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:09.759
Chae Yeon chose the new guy.

1095
00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:12.270
He made my heart flutter,

1096
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.170
and he was throwing himself to the point of getting hurt.

1097
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.710
So I thought I had to choose him.

1098
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.270
When you become a couple like that,

1099
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.579
do you talk to each other even after the shoot?

1100
00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.840
- I... - That never happens.

1101
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.110
talked to him.

1102
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.509
- Hyun Moo, you... - Now that some time has passed,

1103
00:41:26.509 --> 00:41:27.880
she's telling us everything.

1104
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.380
- I wonder who it is. - Tell us who he is.

1105
00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.420
Aren't we all curious?

1106
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.119
- It's fun. - Yes.

1107
00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:36.290
- Why aren't you saying anything? - About what?

1108
00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.659
- You have to ask her a question. - Have you...

1109
00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:38.790
Ask me a question.

1110
00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:41.259
When I say something, you think I'm trying to take your job.

1111
00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:42.429
Ask me a question.

1112
00:41:42.429 --> 00:41:44.570
What would you do...

1113
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.869
if a man suddenly lock his fingers with yours?

1114
00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:49.440
- Would you shake him off? - I won't let go of him.

1115
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.110
Why would I lose the opportunity? I won't lose it.

1116
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.909
It was Sae Ho who did it.

1117
00:41:54.239 --> 00:41:55.980
(She pauses.)

1118
00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.309
Let's say we are...

1119
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:59.909
good friends.

1120
00:41:59.909 --> 00:42:02.920
We met up for a meal and went to see a movie. And I locked our fingers.

1121
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.090
- Right. - What would you do?

1122
00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:05.090
Why are you smiling?

1123
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.550
(It's an awkward situation.)

1124
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.020
What would you do then?

1125
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.489
- What if it's Sae Ho? - Yes.

1126
00:42:09.489 --> 00:42:10.730
He's looking sharp with that dress shirt.

1127
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.389
- Think about it. - I won't shake him off.

1128
00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:14.059
- Really? - Yes.

1129
00:42:14.059 --> 00:42:16.630
- That's amazing. - I think Sae Ho is great.

1130
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.639
Give me some time to think over this.

1131
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:24.469
- He's playing hard-to-get. - So that's what was happening.

1132
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.909
That's what he was doing.

1133
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.440
- She was serious. - I was mistaken.

1134
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.509
When you date someone...

1135
00:42:31.509 --> 00:42:34.219
without officially becoming a couple, it's not very good.

1136
00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:36.320
How long do you think that period should last?

1137
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.389
What do you think, Eun Jung?

1138
00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:39.590
I like...

1139
00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:40.960
taking time to judge someone.

1140
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.320
- How long does it take? - Even if you're just dating?

1141
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.989
When I take long, it takes about a year.

1142
00:42:45.989 --> 00:42:47.029
(Everyone is shocked.)

1143
00:42:47.029 --> 00:42:48.059
- One year? - My gosh.

1144
00:42:48.059 --> 00:42:49.559
- How can it take a year? - Wouldn't he die of impatience?

1145
00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:51.599
How can you take a year to judge someone's character?

1146
00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:54.139
Eun Jung might think they're not in a relationship.

1147
00:42:54.139 --> 00:42:56.239
- But the guy might think... - He might think they are.

1148
00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:58.170
they were in a relationship.

1149
00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:59.309
- Do you draw the line? - He might think that.

1150
00:42:59.309 --> 00:43:02.540
Do you draw a clear line so that he doesn't misunderstand?

1151
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.480
I give subtle hints so that he would know it.

1152
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.409
- What are those hints? - Here's one example.

1153
00:43:06.409 --> 00:43:09.320
When he asks where I am, I tell him why I should tell him.

1154
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.520
- That's how you draw the line. - Yes.

1155
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.659
- And? - When he sends me a message,

1156
00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:16.860
if we were officially going out, I would reply immediately.

1157
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.790
But when we're not officially dating, I don't reply immediately.

1158
00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.159
- You don't. - You make it difficult.

1159
00:43:20.159 --> 00:43:21.500
- You drive guys mad. - She's playing a game.

1160
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.599
- It's too difficult. - We're not in a relationship.

1161
00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:26.770
But it does evolve into a relationship, right?

1162
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.800
- Of course. - But...

1163
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.270
- the steps are difficult. - Right.

1164
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.040
It's even harder than a bear becoming a human.

1165
00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:34.610
- It's harder. - He could bear grudge.

1166
00:43:35.139 --> 00:43:36.809
While doing that, I sometimes...

1167
00:43:36.809 --> 00:43:39.610
do a little test on him.

1168
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.880
- How? - It's too see how he reacts.

1169
00:43:41.949 --> 00:43:43.949
- What do you do? - It's a real test.

1170
00:43:43.949 --> 00:43:46.250
For about a week, I go out of touch.

1171
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.920
- Do you really do that? - Yes.

1172
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.889
- It's like a personality test. - Yes.

1173
00:43:49.889 --> 00:43:51.630
- She makes people go crazy. - Yes.

1174
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.630
Going out of touch for a day is not good enough.

1175
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.270
- You have to do it for a month. - A month.

1176
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.369
Isn't that too long?

1177
00:43:59.369 --> 00:44:01.099
- He might forget you. - What if he forgets you?

1178
00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:03.469
What if he gets a girlfriend in that one month?

1179
00:44:03.469 --> 00:44:05.070
- Then it's over. - That's okay.

1180
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.710
- It means we're not meant to be. - They're not meant to be.

1181
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.710
- The guy... - Yes.

1182
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.480
When you go out of touch, how should he react?

1183
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.679
He should remain calm, right?

1184
00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:14.550
- I see if he's calm about it... - Some can't stand it.

1185
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.550
- Or if he obsesses. - or if he obsesses over me.

1186
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.949
That test is really difficult.

1187
00:44:17.949 --> 00:44:20.719
- He can't get obsessed. - A bar exam would be easier.

1188
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.190
And the test lasts for a year.

1189
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:24.790
It's harder than becoming a member of Wanna One.

1190
00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:29.300
(Eun Jung's boyfriends could form a group.)

1191
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.369
- "I am Eun Jung's boyfriend." - Right.

1192
00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:32.730
- No, it's... - I am Eun Jung's boyfriend

1193
00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:35.099
- It's me - It's me

1194
00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.239
He can't be obsessed with you.

1195
00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:39.540
People who I approve...

1196
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.409
- are really amazing. - I see.

1197
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.779
The test sounds really tough.

1198
00:44:43.779 --> 00:44:46.409
We only heard about it briefly, but it doesn't sound easy.

1199
00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:49.380
So the guys who passed her test are living happily with their wife.

1200
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.090
- She... - You're right.

1201
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.290
- Right? - You're right.

1202
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.290
You raise them.

1203
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.790
- None of them are with me. - She trained them well.

1204
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.529
- Eun Jung... - She trained them all.

1205
00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.599
discovered many good husband materials.

1206
00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:02.599
- She's like a teacher. - She's like an agency owner.

1207
00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.670
The wives of these men might send you a thank you letter.

1208
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.540
"You trained my husband well."

1209
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:09.599
How about you, Chae Yeon?

1210
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:12.009
Actually, I am very bad at expressing my emotions.

1211
00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:13.610
I'm the same to my friends.

1212
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.309
So even if I find someone I am interested in,

1213
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:19.150
- I can't tell him my feelings. - You just keep it to yourself.

1214
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.579
So you have to wait for the guy to approach you.

1215
00:45:21.579 --> 00:45:22.650
He has to approach you first.

1216
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.849
When he approaches me, I am thankful to him.

1217
00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:27.590
- But if he doesn't approach me... - You just feel sorry.

1218
00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:28.659
You think you're not meant to be.

1219
00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:33.059
- I make the guy approach me. - How do you do that?

1220
00:45:33.059 --> 00:45:34.400
That's really difficult.

1221
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.230
- That's... - It's difficult.

1222
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.900
- That's really difficult. - Men are slow.

1223
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.270
- You're a master. - While talking on the phone,

1224
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.900
if the guy I'm interested in says,

1225
00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.469
"I have to wake up at 8am, but I don't know if I can."

1226
00:45:44.469 --> 00:45:46.509
- Let's say he said that. - Let's say he had to get up at six.

1227
00:45:46.509 --> 00:45:48.840
I would wake up 10 minutes before 6 and...

1228
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.309
- You call him. - send him a message if he's up.

1229
00:45:52.579 --> 00:45:54.650
"You said you had to get up early."

1230
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.989
Your voice made it so easy to understand.

1231
00:45:56.989 --> 00:45:59.420
- "Are you up?" - By the way...

1232
00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:00.860
"Are you up? If you're not up..."

1233
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.619
(She would sing her song.)

1234
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.029
(It will force him to get up.)

1235
00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:07.699
- You just need to pinch him. - If he still doesn't wake up,

1236
00:46:07.699 --> 00:46:09.130
I would call him and wake him up.

1237
00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.969
- I'd tell him... - It's lovely.

1238
00:46:10.969 --> 00:46:13.099
- I called him because I was up. - You'd have to remember his words.

1239
00:46:13.099 --> 00:46:14.670
- I'd do that. - Those little things matter.

1240
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:16.300
You're really thankful when someone does that.

1241
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.770
Have you ever sent him a photo of yourself?

1242
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.110
A photo of you crying.

1243
00:46:20.239 --> 00:46:21.579
(He brings up her dark past.)

1244
00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:23.139
I was just asking.

1245
00:46:23.139 --> 00:46:24.849
- That was after her album came out. - "I was just being sad."

1246
00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:27.179
- "I'm watching a movie." - Should I call him while crying?

1247
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.619
Let's say I haven't done it yet.

1248
00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:31.420
When you date a guy,

1249
00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.119
I heard you do a lot of events for him.

1250
00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:34.420
- Do girls do events for guys? - He'd be so happy.

1251
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.590
- Do girls usually do that? - I don't do a lot.

1252
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.730
I like raising the guy's spirit.

1253
00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.759
- That's nice. - You're a good girlfriend.

1254
00:46:40.759 --> 00:46:41.929
- She's a good wife material. - She is.

1255
00:46:41.929 --> 00:46:45.570
I make sure he doesn't know that it was me who did it.

1256
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.840
I cook different dishes,

1257
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.139
put them in a box, and send it to him.

1258
00:46:50.139 --> 00:46:52.809
- I put up a banner for him. - You are amazing.

1259
00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:55.440
- Can you be my boyfriend? - My gosh.

1260
00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.150
Does she have to wait a year?

1261
00:46:57.679 --> 00:46:59.210
She needs to get tested.

1262
00:46:59.409 --> 00:47:00.880
- That's not true. - She needs to get tested.

1263
00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.690
When this gets aired, Eun Jung will...

1264
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.920
- Eun Jung will... - My gosh.

1265
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.090
- Her manager will... - I need to go to the editing room.

1266
00:47:09.719 --> 00:47:12.489
- I... - You say that every time.

1267
00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:15.300
I think this might make it difficult for me to get married.

1268
00:47:15.329 --> 00:47:17.130
On the internet, people...

1269
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.270
will post about how to prepare for Eun Jung's test.

1270
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:20.570
Or how to write a resume for the application.

1271
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.770
People will search about what they should do when she's out of touch.

1272
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:25.469
- It would be really funny... - I...

1273
00:47:25.469 --> 00:47:26.940
if we ask a guy she tested a year after the test.

1274
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.380
He would say, "I just aged a year."

1275
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.739
(He only got a year older.)

1276
00:47:29.739 --> 00:47:32.409
I only wanted to make this show funny.

1277
00:47:32.679 --> 00:47:35.619
But now I'm worried I will lose the chance of getting married.

1278
00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.489
I think you would do big events for your boyfriend.

1279
00:47:37.489 --> 00:47:39.520
- What do you say? - When you're in a relationship.

1280
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.659
I'd treat him so well.

1281
00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:43.020
(She completely changes.)

1282
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:46.360
(She gets embarrassed after saying it.)

1283
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.960
- All right. - She changed.

1284
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.829
Eun Jung, we get it.

1285
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:50.929
(Her attempt to make herself look sweet has failed.)

1286
00:47:50.929 --> 00:47:52.400
- What did I do? - It's so funny.

1287
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.400
When I like someone,

1288
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.570
I treat him really nicely.

1289
00:47:58.570 --> 00:47:59.770
- Right. - Yes.

1290
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.309
- It just takes a long time. - It takes long to be her man.

1291
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:06.909
I heard there's an actor you are interested in.

1292
00:48:06.909 --> 00:48:09.719
- Is there someone? - I don't know about a relationship,

1293
00:48:09.719 --> 00:48:11.949
but I've been watching him closely.

1294
00:48:11.949 --> 00:48:15.020
- He would go through a test too. - Who would it be?

1295
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.730
- It's Ryu Jun Yeol. - Ryu Jun Yeol.

1296
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.690
Ryu Jun Yeol is handsome.

1297
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.800
- But he's got a girlfriend. - He's dating Hye Ri.

1298
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.500
- Right. So I changed my mind. - He's with Hye Ri.

1299
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.270
- It's Cho Sae Ho now. - Really?

1300
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.369
Isn't it such a big jump to go from Jun Yeol to Sae Ho?

1301
00:48:28.369 --> 00:48:30.469
- I mean... - Are you looking down on Sae Ho?

1302
00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:31.909
I am not saying this because I'm on TV.

1303
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:33.409
I really think Sae Ho is amazing.

1304
00:48:33.469 --> 00:48:35.309
- He's really great. - What do you say, Sae Ho?

1305
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:37.179
If I ask for her number after the shoot,

1306
00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:39.949
she's not going to turn me down, is she?

1307
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.779
- She won't say that. - That's a test.

1308
00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:45.989
- Is it? - She will see how you'd react...

1309
00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:48.090
if she doesn't give you her number.

1310
00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:49.119
(Sae Ho becomes one of the men she tested.)

1311
00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:51.529
- Then... - She will see what you'll do...

1312
00:48:51.659 --> 00:48:53.630
- if she stays... - If ever...

1313
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.829
out of touch for a year.

1314
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:57.529
I will send my parents a video message first.

1315
00:48:57.929 --> 00:49:01.170
I think we have to cancel our dinner tomorrow.

1316
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.809
If you make a joke out it, you will lose points.

1317
00:49:03.869 --> 00:49:05.909
- You should take it seriously. - What should I do?

1318
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.880
You should ask how Sae Ho feels about you.

1319
00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.380
If Eun Jung...

1320
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.809
expresses her interest in me,

1321
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:14.349
- why would I reject her? - Right.

1322
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:16.880
- I'd be honored. - You can start dating then.

1323
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.550
I will change to Hyun Moo.

1324
00:49:20.219 --> 00:49:21.659
Don't you think you are too easy?

1325
00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:23.989
- What are you doing? - What just happened?

1326
00:49:23.989 --> 00:49:26.489
You're unbelievable.

1327
00:49:26.489 --> 00:49:28.029
- What are you doing? - Is this the test?

1328
00:49:28.029 --> 00:49:29.360
This is a test.

1329
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.730
- This is a test. - It's a test.

1330
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:32.599
Who are you testing?

1331
00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:33.840
- Sae Ho. - It's a test.

1332
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.070
- Sae Ho. - Stay calm.

1333
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.599
- When she mentioned me... - Hyun Moo is...

1334
00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:38.009
- a good man. - Stay calm.

1335
00:49:38.009 --> 00:49:40.110
You should've smiled.

1336
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.239
(He smiles awkwardly.)

1337
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.380
I wonder if she's...

1338
00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.020
- Yes. - serious about Sae Ho.

1339
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.279
- I wonder if she is serious. - You should exchange numbers.

1340
00:49:49.279 --> 00:49:50.849
- Take her out on a date. - I don't know how she feels.

1341
00:49:50.849 --> 00:49:53.960
If Miss Han is okay with it...

1342
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.590
- Great. - Call her by her first name.

1343
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.159
If Eun Jung is okay with it, I'd love to take her out.

1344
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:02.000
- Good. - We'll check them after a year.

1345
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.099
(The result will be announced a year later.)

1346
00:50:05.699 --> 00:50:09.099
We thank the four guests for joining us today.

1347
00:50:09.099 --> 00:50:11.110
(Thank you everyone.)

1348
00:50:11.869 --> 00:50:14.679
We are The Legendary Big Mouth.

1349
00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:15.710
(Sing My Song)

1350
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:16.940
Long time no see.

1351
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.409
- Long time no see. - Have you been well?

1352
00:50:19.409 --> 00:50:21.820
- I missed you all. - Me too.

1353
00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:25.389
- I missed you. - We have news to share.

1354
00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:26.790
- Soo Yong. - Yes.

1355
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.360
Soo Yong was...

1356
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.659
once really busy. I heard he had...

1357
00:50:31.659 --> 00:50:33.659
- He was on five shows. - How many are you on now?

1358
00:50:33.659 --> 00:50:36.559
I am exclusively on Happy Together.

1359
00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.670
(He is exclusively on Happy Together.)

1360
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.400
You're exclusively on this show.

1361
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.739
You can't see him anywhere else.

1362
00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:47.579
- Only on Happy Together. - These days, he bought...

1363
00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.210
the jacket in different colors.

1364
00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.250
- I did buy them in other colors. - They are quite light.

1365
00:50:52.809 --> 00:50:55.719
(Last week, he revealed his red jacket.)

1366
00:50:56.179 --> 00:50:57.550
What kind of colors does it come in?

1367
00:50:57.849 --> 00:50:59.050
- I have them in many colors... - You have them all.

1368
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.659
- at home. - You'll take turns?

1369
00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:02.059
I have to appear on TV to wear them.

1370
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:04.190
(I have to appear on TV to wear them.)

1371
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:06.190
He bought them in different colors with the commercial he did.

1372
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:08.230
I haven't seen them for a while. They have changed a lot.

1373
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.570
When I saw Yong Man's outfit today,

1374
00:51:10.869 --> 00:51:12.599
I thought he was a lord from the medieval time.

1375
00:51:12.599 --> 00:51:13.599
(An outfit from the medieval time)

1376
00:51:13.969 --> 00:51:17.210
- The rings on his sweater... - You know he's like a count.

1377
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.309
I wondered why the door-rings from my house were on his sweater.

1378
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:21.340
- You know nothing about fashion. - They are rings on the doors.

1379
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.840
- The ones from the old times. - Your sweater is pretty cool.

1380
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.809
- The rings on the drawers. - Exactly.

1381
00:51:24.809 --> 00:51:26.480
Don't you think you buttoned them all the way up?

1382
00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.820
I don't know which ones are buttoned up and which ones not.

1383
00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.989
Isn't this like a straitjacket used by magicians for tricks?

1384
00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:35.920
It does look like it after looking at it for a while.

1385
00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:37.259
That's precisely it.

1386
00:51:37.259 --> 00:51:39.159
- In a way, - You can't tell the difference.

1387
00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:41.360
this is a battle about who gets out of this karaoke first.

1388
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.400
I think my stylist made me wear this to match the concept.

1389
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.670
Last week, it was a special about getting off work early.

1390
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.770
- You were the Get-off-work Fairy. - You must tell us what happened.

1391
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.940
- I was the first one to leave. - You were always the first one.

1392
00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.940
- Yes. - He's the Get-off-work Fairy.

1393
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.579
- Seok Jin is Get-off-work Ghost. - Get-off-work Ghost.

1394
00:51:56.739 --> 00:51:58.179
He can't seem to get off work.

1395
00:51:58.179 --> 00:52:00.619
Whenever I'm paired with a singer born in 1981, I'm done for.

1396
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.349
I'll be the last one.

1397
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:04.920
Kim Tae Woo, Lyn, and Gummy.

1398
00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.119
Everyone was born in 1981.

1399
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.059
Every one of them went home last?

1400
00:52:08.059 --> 00:52:09.860
- Yes, they were last. - Goodness, that's unbelievable.

1401
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.829
It was a shock that Gummy was last.

1402
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.259
I never thought it'd be her.

1403
00:52:14.259 --> 00:52:16.659
Anyway, let me tell you about today's district.

1404
00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:19.329
- We are in Hongdae. - Hongdae!

1405
00:52:19.329 --> 00:52:21.099
(Hongdae street in Seogyo-dong)

1406
00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:25.509
All right. Let's find out four teams of today's singers.

1407
00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.239
- Let's meet these famous singers. - Luck plays a role.

1408
00:52:28.239 --> 00:52:31.809
We have invited the most sought-after singers in each genre.

1409
00:52:31.809 --> 00:52:34.849
- Sought-after stars in each genre? - We'll present ultimate singers.

1410
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:37.949
We are going to start with the singer in the first room.

1411
00:52:37.949 --> 00:52:40.360
It's Room with Soulful, Masterpiece Songs.

1412
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.219
- "Soulful"? - "Soulful".

1413
00:52:42.219 --> 00:52:43.730
- That's it's rhythm and blues. - Yes, it must be.

1414
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.190
- It's rhythm and blues. - It definitely is.

1415
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.429
Let us present you the first room.

1416
00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:51.230
("One Love Is Forgotten with Another Love" By Soulful Singer)

1417
00:52:51.254 --> 00:52:56.254
<font color="#F1E6B2">[VIU Ver]</font> <font color="#ff00ff">E523 Happy Together</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1418
00:52:56.739 --> 00:52:59.509
(He calmly starts singing.)

1419
00:53:00.639 --> 00:53:01.980
- It's a guy. - It's a man.

1420
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.110
Isn't this Ha Reem's song?

1421
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.050
He has a sweet voice.

1422
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.290
(Mellow voice)

1423
00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:16.790
(The soulful vocalist sings nonchalantly.)

1424
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:20.290
He's the friend born in 1981 whom Gummy has mentioned.

1425
00:53:20.599 --> 00:53:22.360
- He was born in 1981? - Give us a hint.

1426
00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.500
- If he was born in 1981... - Wait!

1427
00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.029
- It's Wheesung! - Then I won't guess this singer.

1428
00:53:26.029 --> 00:53:27.340
Soo Hong! I know the answer.

1429
00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.869
- Wheesung. - Wheesung?

1430
00:53:28.869 --> 00:53:29.969
It's not Wheesung.

1431
00:53:31.739 --> 00:53:35.779
(Is it Wheesung who was born in 1981 with full of soul?)

1432
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.050
That's correct!

1433
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:39.710
- It was Wheesung? - My gosh!

1434
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.949
- Didn't I tell you? - Why is he coming onto our show?

1435
00:53:41.949 --> 00:53:44.050
You know that singers born in 1981 will get off work last!

1436
00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:45.290
He sang it at a lower tone.

1437
00:53:48.159 --> 00:53:50.460
(Wheesung)

1438
00:53:51.489 --> 00:53:53.559
(He's like a generator of masterpiece ballad songs.)

1439
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:57.130
("Can't You", "Heartsore Story",)

1440
00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:01.800
("Even Thought of Marriage", "With Me", and so on...)

1441
00:54:04.409 --> 00:54:07.579
(Wheesung, the representative singer of rhythm and blues)

1442
00:54:09.139 --> 00:54:11.449
- Wheesung. - Soo Hong is your partner.

1443
00:54:11.449 --> 00:54:13.050
- Welcome. - Hello.

1444
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:14.579
- He is... - Goodness.

1445
00:54:14.579 --> 00:54:17.250
- He and I are friends. - Really?

1446
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.889
Singers who were born in 1981...

1447
00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:22.320
- always stayed until the end. - Everyone did.

1448
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.230
I heard that Hwanhee wasn't able to get off work.

1449
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:26.829
- Are you friends with him? - Yes.

1450
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:28.630
- Gummy couldn't either. - Hwanhee and Tae Woo.

1451
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:30.699
- Lyn and Tae Woo too? - Lyn either.

1452
00:54:30.699 --> 00:54:32.029
- That includes Gummy. - Right.

1453
00:54:32.029 --> 00:54:34.840
- No one really got off work. - I can already see your future.

1454
00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.770
- I'll be an exception. - I know how it will play out.

1455
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:39.309
But the thing is that they all partnered up with Seok Jin.

1456
00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.940
- They were all my partners. - Is that so?

1457
00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.579
So we wonder if this is the curse of Seok Jin...

1458
00:54:42.809 --> 00:54:44.150
- or singers who were born in 1981. - It will be decided today.

1459
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:46.349
- Today's result will determine it. - It will be revealed today.

1460
00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.750
- Is it me or them? - Wheesung, you released an album.

1461
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.719
- Yes. - Your name is Realslow?

1462
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:52.150
"Realslow"?

1463
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:54.889
You can treat it as a name for the project.

1464
00:54:54.889 --> 00:54:58.590
There's this genre called slow jam in rhythm and blues.

1465
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:00.800
- black musicians use this genre. - I know what it is.

1466
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.270
It's the kind of music you play when you're setting the mood with girls.

1467
00:55:04.529 --> 00:55:06.500
I really like the genre.

1468
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.239
I really wanted to make real music of the genre.

1469
00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:10.969
So I named it "Realslow".

1470
00:55:11.239 --> 00:55:15.340
I plan to release that kind of songs under the name Realslow.

1471
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.980
I wonder what kind of song it is.

1472
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.550
- How is it like? - How different is it?

1473
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:20.250
- What is it? - We don't know the genre well.

1474
00:55:20.449 --> 00:55:22.250
- Besides, we don't... - It's about slow jam.

1475
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.989
play music at night with women.

1476
00:55:24.989 --> 00:55:25.989
(They don't listen to music.)

1477
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:27.860
- That's too harsh. - Why did you say that?

1478
00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.590
- We play music. - Of course we play music.

1479
00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:31.790
- Why wouldn't we play songs? - They are used to hearing nagging.

1480
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.960
- What are you talking about? - They are used to that.

1481
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.730
- I listen to music at home. - It's great to play...

1482
00:55:35.929 --> 00:55:38.670
- "Kiss and Say Goodbye" at night. - "Kiss and Say Goodbye"?

1483
00:55:39.329 --> 00:55:41.639
- So what is the song like? - Sing a snippet for us.

1484
00:55:41.639 --> 00:55:45.040
The genre of some songs I released back in the days is slow jam.

1485
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.639
- There's a song named "Choco Luv". - How does it go?

1486
00:55:46.639 --> 00:55:49.610
- Let me sing you a bit of the song. - Sing us just a little.

1487
00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:51.949
At a corner

1488
00:55:51.949 --> 00:55:54.949
(Wheesung slowly begins dancing to the song.)

1489
00:55:54.949 --> 00:55:57.090
- He's incredible. - Our eyes meet

1490
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:59.750
(He gets into the song.)

1491
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.590
- The air is changing. - This is nice.

1492
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:04.159
You're my only one, only one, only girl

1493
00:56:04.159 --> 00:56:05.529
Isn't this just a ballad song?

1494
00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:06.529
No, no.

1495
00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.159
I ask because I don't know much about music.

1496
00:56:08.159 --> 00:56:09.159
- No, it's different. - He's doing his best.

1497
00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:10.329
- What's wrong with you? - He just doesn't know.

1498
00:56:10.329 --> 00:56:12.230
I really don't know. Isn't it a ballad song?

1499
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:13.940
- You don't know the feel. - They have different rhythms.

1500
00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.699
- Oh, right. - Sing it as a ballad song.

1501
00:56:15.699 --> 00:56:16.699
This is the rhythm for ballad songs.

1502
00:56:16.699 --> 00:56:18.770
At a corner of my room

1503
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:20.509
- It doesn't have the vibe. - Sing it as Realslow.

1504
00:56:21.079 --> 00:56:22.679
(Singing slowly)

1505
00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.849
- So this is... - You didn't put effort before.

1506
00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:26.779
- Now, you put effort into it. - No. Hey, look.

1507
00:56:26.779 --> 00:56:28.079
- That's not it? - Let me tell you about the feel.

1508
00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:29.150
- I don't know. That's all. - So this is...

1509
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:31.090
If ballad songs grab you like this,

1510
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.449
this kind of songs grab you like this.

1511
00:56:33.449 --> 00:56:34.460
(It's a soft touch.)

1512
00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.290
It tickles and spreads throughout your body.

1513
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:39.829
- I see. That's how it is. - It's soft.

1514
00:56:39.889 --> 00:56:42.099
- Goodness! - I must teach him about rhythm.

1515
00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:44.630
- Exactly. He has no clue. - But I can differentiate them.

1516
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.270
- You can? - Stop lying.

1517
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.139
- It's groovy. It's a slow song. - Yes, a bit.

1518
00:56:48.139 --> 00:56:49.540
We know. There's a specific feel to it.

1519
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.139
- Precisely. - It's special.

1520
00:56:51.139 --> 00:56:52.670
- You felt it too, correct? - Of course I did.

1521
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:55.840
All right. Soo Hong and Wheesung are paired up now.

1522
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.949
The second room is Room of a Barefoot Diva.

1523
00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:01.050
- That sounds like Lee Eun Mi. - Of course, we know her.

1524
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.150
- Is it Eun Mi? - Eun Mi?

1525
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:03.449
Wheesung, are you in the dark too?

1526
00:57:03.449 --> 00:57:04.949
- Yes. It sounds like her. - All right.

1527
00:57:04.949 --> 00:57:07.960
- The nickname is... - It's Eun Mi's nickname.

1528
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.989
Let's check out the second room.

1529
00:57:09.989 --> 00:57:12.090
Why did she name herself Barefoot Diva?

1530
00:57:14.059 --> 00:57:15.960
("Greenhorn" by Barefoot Diva)

1531
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:20.500
(Her long hair stands out from the back.)

1532
00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:25.770
(Can you recognize her voice?)

1533
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:30.009
- Isn't this "Greenhorn"? - Let us listen to her voice.

1534
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.650
"Greenhorn"? The song is...

1535
00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:35.550
("Greenhorn"? Then she should be...)

1536
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:37.290
- I'm so curious. - I know the answer!

1537
00:57:38.949 --> 00:57:40.320
- Yes? - Yangpa.

1538
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:42.659
You always say her name.

1539
00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.059
Gosh, how can you always name her?

1540
00:57:44.059 --> 00:57:45.360
Yangpa, you should star on our show once!

1541
00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:47.960
(Shaking)

1542
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.300
(She's trying to hold in her excitement.)

1543
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.300
- I know the answer. - Yes?

1544
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.739
- It's the one I said earlier. - Okay.

1545
00:57:54.739 --> 00:57:57.040
- "Barefoot" reminds me of her. - Who is she?

1546
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.710
- Who is she? - I know who she is.

1547
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.639
"24 Hours". It's Sun Mi.

1548
00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.309
Sun Mi! That's correct.

1549
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:06.250
- It was Sun Mi? - Yes.

1550
00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.750
(Sun Mi)

1551
00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:12.150
(She debuted as a solo artist with daring charms.)

1552
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:13.860
("24 Hours")

1553
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.320
("Full Moon")

1554
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.159
("Gashina")

1555
00:58:18.159 --> 00:58:20.190
(She's the hottest singer.)

1556
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.400
(She aims to become the center of 2018, going beyond her popularity.)

1557
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.329
(The representative dancing diva, Sun Mi)

1558
00:58:27.469 --> 00:58:30.099
Her song hit the charts hard in the 2nd half of 2017.

1559
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.570
- I think she is... - She sang "Gashina".

1560
00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:34.579
the most promising singer who might get off work first.

1561
00:58:34.579 --> 00:58:36.210
- Yong Man, you might... - She sang "Gashina".

1562
00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:38.650
- She did sing that song. - It's highly likely to be sung.

1563
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.050
- I have to agree. - That's right.

1564
00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:43.079
- Are you leaving me? It's great. - Are you leaving me?

1565
00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:44.949
I wonder if Yong Man is going to get to...

1566
00:58:44.949 --> 00:58:47.290
leave Seok Jin with the song, "Gashina".

1567
00:58:47.489 --> 00:58:49.159
- Will I leave first? - Will I leave first?

1568
00:58:49.159 --> 00:58:50.329
Which one will leave first?

1569
00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.190
Or will his sanity leave him first after waiting for a long time?

1570
00:58:53.759 --> 00:58:56.199
- I either leave or my sanity does. - Will his sanity leave him?

1571
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.969
- I like the rhyme. I like it. - Either you or the sanity will go.

1572
00:58:59.329 --> 00:59:03.840
When we filmed this segment at various karaoke rooms,

1573
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.570
- A lot of people sang the song. - It's sung within 1st 30 minutes.

1574
00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:08.940
- What a bummer. - This is amazing.

1575
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:11.309
- It's incredible. - People sing it within 30 minutes.

1576
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:16.449
- New hit songs have the upper hand. - That's right.

1577
00:59:16.449 --> 00:59:19.650
- Wheesung has a lot of hit songs, - That's so true.

1578
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:24.230
but his songs aren't listed in the recent music charts.

1579
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:26.730
Some of my songs are sung by many regardless of the trend.

1580
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:27.759
I know that.

1581
00:59:27.759 --> 00:59:29.929
It sounds like you're already offended.

1582
00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:33.170
Wheesung, you might get angry at me later in the shoot.

1583
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:34.800
- His true colors are showing. - Yes, they are.

1584
00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.239
It's because this is hard to digest.

1585
00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:37.270
Sun Mi.

1586
00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:39.139
(The dancing diva appears.)

1587
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.940
- You must be cold. - Goodness.

1588
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.750
- Your partner is Yong Man. - Hello.

1589
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:44.750
(They are the second team.)

1590
00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.550
- How did you guess it was me? - How have you been?

1591
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.050
(A bad example)

1592
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.250
(A good example)

1593
00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.619
You guys behave differently when Wheesung showed up...

1594
00:59:52.619 --> 00:59:53.860
and when Sun Mi showed up.

1595
00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.460
- What do you mean? - It felt like...

1596
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.759
- you guys just looked down on me. - Wheesung.

1597
00:59:57.829 --> 01:00:00.360
- Goodness, he's Wheesung! - My gosh.

1598
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.059
- It's Wheesung. - I have known you for a long time.

1599
01:00:02.059 --> 01:00:03.130
- Seriously. - Wait.

1600
01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.630
We got up and welcomed you.

1601
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:06.429
- You should've worn her outfit. - We showed you the seat.

1602
01:00:06.429 --> 01:00:08.900
We got up for Sun Mi and showed her the seat like we did for you.

1603
01:00:09.869 --> 01:00:11.869
(Wheesung's entrance)

1604
01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:13.409
(They welcomed him with a gentlemanlike applause.)

1605
01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:14.409
(Staring)

1606
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.579
(Sun Mi's entrance)

1607
01:00:17.579 --> 01:00:19.349
(They welcomed her with her hit songs.)

1608
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.219
(Dancing)

1609
01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:24.550
(Oh, well...)

1610
01:00:24.949 --> 01:00:26.590
- The energy feels different. - What does he lack?

1611
01:00:27.259 --> 01:00:29.889
I haven't seen you for ages, Wheesung.

1612
01:00:29.889 --> 01:00:32.230
- Has it been 10 years? - Yes, it has.

1613
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:35.130
But it looks like your time is going backward.

1614
01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.770
(It looks like your time is going backward.)

1615
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:39.630
- Wheesung. - Yes?

1616
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.170
You are way nicer to her than you were to us.

1617
01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:43.639
- Hold on. - I mean, you treat her...

1618
01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:46.270
- I think I can understand you now. - Goodness. Seriously.

1619
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.309
I'm quite offended.

1620
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:49.040
- Do you get it now? - Come on.

1621
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.079
- Yes. - He turned his head.

1622
01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:53.079
- He was like this. - His head peeped out.

1623
01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:54.949
(Part 2 will continue in a minute.)

1624
01:00:55.253 --> 01:00:58.083
She has many songs.

1625
01:00:58.083 --> 01:01:01.154
"24 Hours", "Full Moon"...

1626
01:01:01.154 --> 01:01:02.864
- "Full Moon". - and "Gashina".

1627
01:01:03.464 --> 01:01:05.134
What's the secret of your success?

1628
01:01:05.494 --> 01:01:08.464
- Well, my dance is very unique. - Yes.

1629
01:01:09.103 --> 01:01:10.433
- It's very unique. - Right.

1630
01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.034
I...

1631
01:01:13.473 --> 01:01:16.304
- don't try to settle. - I see.

1632
01:01:16.304 --> 01:01:19.214
You see she was barefoot on her first album.

1633
01:01:19.214 --> 01:01:20.514
The dance for the new song is pretty difficult.

1634
01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:23.014
- It's not easy to do it. - You're pretty good.

1635
01:01:23.014 --> 01:01:24.944
Of course. Shooting is a hard one as well.

1636
01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:27.253
- You don't shoot like this. - Right.

1637
01:01:27.253 --> 01:01:29.784
- You need to move your shoulder. - He's right.

1638
01:01:29.784 --> 01:01:32.353
I seriously watched her music video like 50 times.

1639
01:01:32.353 --> 01:01:34.793
I said this on the interview as well.

1640
01:01:34.793 --> 01:01:37.994
Seok Jin knows all the details of my music video.

1641
01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.364
- He knows a lot. - I...

1642
01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.634
Why do you only watch female music videos?

1643
01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:44.663
- You're so strange. - That's not true.

1644
01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:47.634
It's not any female music video, but Sun Mi's.

1645
01:01:48.174 --> 01:01:50.873
- I told you last time when we met. - Right.

1646
01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:53.844
- I analyzed her music video. - Right.

1647
01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:54.944
- I know. - Yes.

1648
01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.114
I'm confident.

1649
01:01:56.214 --> 01:01:59.913
Don't analyze the music video. Analyze your wife's state instead.

1650
01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:01.984
She didn't go home again.

1651
01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:04.554
- She was on a trip. - She never comes back home.

1652
01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.094
Why does she only take children on a trip?

1653
01:02:07.094 --> 01:02:08.924
My gosh. Okay.

1654
01:02:09.364 --> 01:02:11.424
We have a pretty competitive line up today.

1655
01:02:11.424 --> 01:02:13.194
We have Wheesung and Sun Mi.

1656
01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:14.563
- Next, - There is a bit of confusion.

1657
01:02:14.563 --> 01:02:18.134
let's check out the third room. Please come out.

1658
01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:21.473
("Wa" by Lee Jung Hyun)

1659
01:02:23.203 --> 01:02:24.203
(Bowing)

1660
01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:28.014
- It's flashy. - That's Jin Young.

1661
01:02:29.214 --> 01:02:30.844
(Dancing)

1662
01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:33.083
I know. Hong Jin Young.

1663
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.313
- I think that's her. - Answer.

1664
01:02:34.313 --> 01:02:35.654
- Hong Jin Young. - Is it correct?

1665
01:02:35.654 --> 01:02:38.594
- Is it Hong Jin Young? - That must be the answer.

1666
01:02:38.694 --> 01:02:39.924
Correct.

1667
01:02:40.353 --> 01:02:41.893
- You should've waited. - She's not even singing yet.

1668
01:02:41.893 --> 01:02:43.123
How did you know when she's singing?

1669
01:02:43.324 --> 01:02:46.134
She was moving like this.

1670
01:02:46.134 --> 01:02:47.163
I can tell from her dance.

1671
01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:49.163
I can tell it's her from the way she dances.

1672
01:02:49.464 --> 01:02:51.734
- It's Jin Young's move. - I mean...

1673
01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.833
I should've answered it for her.

1674
01:02:54.973 --> 01:02:57.174
(They weren't sure, but that was the answer.)

1675
01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:02.313
(She's extremely excited.)

1676
01:03:02.683 --> 01:03:04.714
(You, Happy Together.)

1677
01:03:07.484 --> 01:03:09.924
(Hong Jin Young)

1678
01:03:10.924 --> 01:03:12.453
(The idol in the field of trot, the queen of festivals)

1679
01:03:13.753 --> 01:03:16.194
(She has many hit songs like "Love Battery", "Boogie Man",)

1680
01:03:16.194 --> 01:03:17.563
("Cheer Up", and "Thumb Up")

1681
01:03:18.563 --> 01:03:20.464
(And the trot met EDM.)

1682
01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.003
(Pioneer of EDM trot)

1683
01:03:23.904 --> 01:03:26.373
(The leader of trot, Hong Jin Young)

1684
01:03:26.373 --> 01:03:28.844
- Jin Young. - We answered it too fast.

1685
01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:32.074
- Hello. - Jin Young.

1686
01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:34.714
- Here. - Hello.

1687
01:03:34.714 --> 01:03:35.714
Hello.

1688
01:03:35.714 --> 01:03:38.083
- Nice to meet you. - It seems she is campaigning.

1689
01:03:38.413 --> 01:03:40.154
- Nice to meet you. - Have a seat.

1690
01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:43.384
- She's here. - Come here.

1691
01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:44.884
- Actually... - Yes.

1692
01:03:44.884 --> 01:03:47.623
Soo Yong answered it as soon as he saw your dance.

1693
01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.264
- Really? - Even before you sang.

1694
01:03:49.264 --> 01:03:50.264
Without hearing you singing.

1695
01:03:50.264 --> 01:03:52.063
- When you did this. - This.

1696
01:03:52.063 --> 01:03:55.003
I could tell that it was your move.

1697
01:03:55.003 --> 01:03:56.203
- Really? - Yes.

1698
01:03:56.203 --> 01:03:57.734
I restrained myself as much as I could.

1699
01:03:57.734 --> 01:04:00.603
- No. - Not many female singers do that.

1700
01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:01.703
(The dance is not common for female singers.)

1701
01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:04.473
- Jin Young is... - Yes.

1702
01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:06.273
- the queen of festival. - Right.

1703
01:04:06.273 --> 01:04:10.484
She spends more than 100,000 dollars...

1704
01:04:10.484 --> 01:04:12.654
in a year for gas.

1705
01:04:12.654 --> 01:04:14.154
- Awesome. - Really?

1706
01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:15.554
- Really? - Change it to diesel.

1707
01:04:15.554 --> 01:04:17.453
She spends 120,000 dollars for gas in a year.

1708
01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:20.424
You have more than 1,000 festivals a year on average?

1709
01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:22.893
It's a bit...

1710
01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:26.333
- exaggerated. - Yes.

1711
01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:29.703
What's the most number of festivals you had in a day?

1712
01:04:29.703 --> 01:04:32.674
- For this year, it's 6. - 6 in a day.

1713
01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:34.234
- Six in a day. - What time should she start?

1714
01:04:34.234 --> 01:04:37.773
Sometimes you get confused with the name of the festival.

1715
01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:38.813
It shouldn't happen though.

1716
01:04:38.813 --> 01:04:42.083
When I do, I say, "Thank you for inviting me."

1717
01:04:42.614 --> 01:04:44.284
- Oh, when you can't remember? - Yes.

1718
01:04:44.284 --> 01:04:46.554
Because you're in a rush even though you heard it.

1719
01:04:46.554 --> 01:04:47.683
"Thank you for inviting me."

1720
01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:50.223
The thing is when I have 4 or 5 festivals,

1721
01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:51.324
I can't say that every time.

1722
01:04:51.324 --> 01:04:53.554
- People record it nowadays. - Right.

1723
01:04:53.554 --> 01:04:56.964
So I say in the first festival, "Thank you for inviting me."

1724
01:04:56.964 --> 01:05:00.833
In the second on, "Thank you for inviting me to this happy place."

1725
01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:04.734
In the last one, "Thank you for inviting me to this pleasing place."

1726
01:05:05.203 --> 01:05:09.143
(Jin Young's 3 festival comments)

1727
01:05:10.703 --> 01:05:13.043
- Meaningful, happy and pleasing. - Yes.

1728
01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:16.083
- Is there anything you say... - She grabs the attention.

1729
01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:17.944
to grab the attention when you get there?

1730
01:05:17.944 --> 01:05:19.484
For me,

1731
01:05:19.484 --> 01:05:23.154
- I provide SV for the audience. - I see.

1732
01:05:23.154 --> 01:05:24.924
The service designed for them.

1733
01:05:24.924 --> 01:05:26.453
- "SV." - Yes.

1734
01:05:26.453 --> 01:05:28.123
- It's an acronym. - Service.

1735
01:05:28.123 --> 01:05:29.324
- SV for service. - Yes.

1736
01:05:29.324 --> 01:05:32.264
I go to festivals with elderly people...

1737
01:05:32.264 --> 01:05:34.234
and university festivals.

1738
01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:36.464
So it's different when there are young people.

1739
01:05:36.464 --> 01:05:37.964
- Of course. - Yes.

1740
01:05:37.964 --> 01:05:39.973
I sing EDM version of "Love Battery".

1741
01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:43.273
"Love Battery" EDM version for university festivals?

1742
01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.813
So you have EDM version of "Love Battery"...

1743
01:05:45.813 --> 01:05:48.014
and a normal one for elderly people.

1744
01:05:48.014 --> 01:05:49.944
- You switch the batteries. - Yes. Correct.

1745
01:05:49.944 --> 01:05:52.484
How is your opening speech different for elderly people...

1746
01:05:52.484 --> 01:05:54.714
- and for university students? - When you go to university.

1747
01:05:54.714 --> 01:05:57.183
- When I have elderly people, - You need to grab their attention.

1748
01:05:57.183 --> 01:06:00.223
I have to speak loud and have a big smile as I appear.

1749
01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:01.523
- Show us please. - Sure.

1750
01:06:01.523 --> 01:06:03.824
- When I go on the stage... - For elderly people.

1751
01:06:03.824 --> 01:06:07.234
Hello. I'm Hong Jin Young. Nice to meet you.

1752
01:06:07.393 --> 01:06:08.404
(Old men like it.)

1753
01:06:08.404 --> 01:06:09.464
Fantastic.

1754
01:06:09.464 --> 01:06:12.674
You're like a machine.

1755
01:06:12.674 --> 01:06:14.333
"Nice to meet you."

1756
01:06:14.574 --> 01:06:16.273
- I need to be polite. - I see.

1757
01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:18.344
- What about for students? - You look pretty polite.

1758
01:06:18.344 --> 01:06:21.473
Right. For university students, since they're young...

1759
01:06:21.473 --> 01:06:25.054
Hello. I'm Hong Jin Young. Make some noise.

1760
01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:27.853
"Make some noise."

1761
01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:30.384
You need to make the move as you say it.

1762
01:06:30.384 --> 01:06:33.654
I'm sorry, but everything she says doesn't sound pure,

1763
01:06:33.654 --> 01:06:36.293
- but she's used to it. - Come on.

1764
01:06:36.563 --> 01:06:38.534
Don't say that.

1765
01:06:38.534 --> 01:06:41.634
- Seriously. - By the way,

1766
01:06:41.634 --> 01:06:44.163
Wheesung's a big fan...

1767
01:06:44.163 --> 01:06:45.973
- of Jin Young. - I'm a fan.

1768
01:06:45.973 --> 01:06:48.473
- Really? Thank you. - I...

1769
01:06:48.473 --> 01:06:52.913
noticed that when she's there, she lights up the mood.

1770
01:06:52.913 --> 01:06:54.514
- She's doing that again today. - Right.

1771
01:06:54.913 --> 01:06:57.444
- Thank you. - She has bright energy.

1772
01:06:57.444 --> 01:06:59.154
I'm sorry, but who are you winking at?

1773
01:06:59.453 --> 01:07:01.954
- Who are you doing that to? - At the camera.

1774
01:07:01.954 --> 01:07:03.923
- There are many cameras. - Yes.

1775
01:07:03.923 --> 01:07:07.523
You see the one with the red light? That's my camera.

1776
01:07:08.393 --> 01:07:10.263
- I'm sorry, but that's our camera. - I'm sorry.

1777
01:07:10.523 --> 01:07:12.933
- It's all ours. - That's all ours.

1778
01:07:12.933 --> 01:07:14.263
It's all ours.

1779
01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.633
What red light are you talking about?

1780
01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:17.463
- The thing is... - Yes.

1781
01:07:17.463 --> 01:07:20.504
Seok Jin was thinking about saying it.

1782
01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:23.173
Seok Jin refused your song?

1783
01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:24.374
- Yes. - Did that happen?

1784
01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:25.544
- Yes. - I didn't refuse it.

1785
01:07:26.044 --> 01:07:28.383
Rather than saying he refused it,

1786
01:07:28.383 --> 01:07:29.984
when I played the song for him,

1787
01:07:29.984 --> 01:07:33.813
"It's good, but I don't think it suits me."

1788
01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:36.284
- He pretty much refused it. - He refused it.

1789
01:07:36.284 --> 01:07:39.154
- I didn't refuse it. - You're unbelievable.

1790
01:07:39.154 --> 01:07:42.023
- It was electronic trot. - "Electronic trot"?

1791
01:07:42.563 --> 01:07:44.624
- "Electronic trot." - Is that a genre?

1792
01:07:44.624 --> 01:07:45.963
- Yes. - "Electronic trot."

1793
01:07:45.963 --> 01:07:47.734
- It's electronic trot. - Okay.

1794
01:07:47.734 --> 01:07:50.433
- The first one was "Ring Ring". - Ring ring

1795
01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:53.473
I decided to write a ballad trot...

1796
01:07:53.473 --> 01:07:56.473
since I wrote a fast song before.

1797
01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:58.414
That's how I wrote it.

1798
01:07:58.713 --> 01:08:01.414
- The song was pretty good. - Really?

1799
01:08:01.414 --> 01:08:04.383
It sounded a bit like Chinese music.

1800
01:08:04.383 --> 01:08:06.984
When you listen to popular trot songs,

1801
01:08:06.984 --> 01:08:09.254
- they have that Chinese feeling. - I see.

1802
01:08:09.254 --> 01:08:11.994
- Can you sing for us? - Like...

1803
01:08:12.393 --> 01:08:15.563
(Singing)

1804
01:08:17.824 --> 01:08:20.633
- That's good. -That's like "I Love You".

1805
01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.364
Is it?

1806
01:08:23.404 --> 01:08:24.864
(The song he refused)

1807
01:08:24.864 --> 01:08:27.074
Were you going to give this song to Seok Jin?

1808
01:08:27.074 --> 01:08:28.704
- Yes. - Why didn't you take it?

1809
01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.374
- Do you like it? - Yes.

1810
01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.374
(He is so gullible.)

1811
01:08:32.473 --> 01:08:35.084
- He refused a really nice song. - That's right.

1812
01:08:35.084 --> 01:08:36.614
- I memorized it already. - Isn't it nice?

1813
01:08:36.614 --> 01:08:38.084
- The melody. - It's nice.

1814
01:08:38.084 --> 01:08:40.154
(The melody is easy to remember.)

1815
01:08:40.513 --> 01:08:41.923
I'll take it, Jin Young.

1816
01:08:42.353 --> 01:08:44.853
- Give me one more chance. - This song's nice.

1817
01:08:44.853 --> 01:08:47.324
- Do you want it now, Seok Jin? - Yes.

1818
01:08:47.324 --> 01:08:49.494
- The melody lingers in my ears. - It does.

1819
01:08:49.494 --> 01:08:51.124
- How about me? - What?

1820
01:08:51.124 --> 01:08:52.194
Do you want it?

1821
01:08:52.534 --> 01:08:54.164
- She's so bright. - Her tone changed.

1822
01:08:54.164 --> 01:08:55.704
Why did you refuse it?

1823
01:08:56.864 --> 01:08:59.273
- This isn't right. - I...

1824
01:08:59.273 --> 01:09:00.704
This isn't right, Wheesung.

1825
01:09:00.704 --> 01:09:03.374
- Even if I was a composer... - What about it?

1826
01:09:03.374 --> 01:09:05.273
Do you want to win me so desperately?

1827
01:09:05.273 --> 01:09:06.673
- It's getting serious. - The song is...

1828
01:09:06.673 --> 01:09:08.713
Give it to Wheesung.

1829
01:09:08.713 --> 01:09:10.914
- Jin Young's so happy. - Of course.

1830
01:09:10.914 --> 01:09:13.313
I've thought about it.

1831
01:09:13.313 --> 01:09:16.053
Kyung Hwan refused "Ring Ring",

1832
01:09:16.053 --> 01:09:17.723
but Young Chul did well.

1833
01:09:17.723 --> 01:09:20.624
I feel like my songs do well...

1834
01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.723
- after getting refused. - Right.

1835
01:09:22.723 --> 01:09:26.063
Seok Jin refused it, and Wheesung took it.

1836
01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.963
- It's great. - She didn't get rejected.

1837
01:09:29.164 --> 01:09:32.133
- He'll make it great. - I'll make it great.

1838
01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:35.773
- This is bad. - This is interesting.

1839
01:09:35.773 --> 01:09:38.473
- I will stay out of it. - Will you really do it?

1840
01:09:38.473 --> 01:09:39.813
- Yes, I will do it. - Really?

1841
01:09:39.813 --> 01:09:41.173
- I will do it. - He changed a lot.

1842
01:09:41.173 --> 01:09:43.213
- Will you really do it? - It's done.

1843
01:09:43.213 --> 01:09:45.914
I'm good now. Seok Jin, don't call me.

1844
01:09:48.553 --> 01:09:49.824
You lost the chance.

1845
01:09:51.454 --> 01:09:55.124
(Meanwhile, the last team is still waiting.)

1846
01:09:56.723 --> 01:09:57.794
I am hungry.

1847
01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.664
(Who are they?)

1848
01:10:01.494 --> 01:10:03.063
Now, the last team...

1849
01:10:03.063 --> 01:10:04.963
- will be in Seok Jin's team. - My goodness.

1850
01:10:04.963 --> 01:10:06.504
- In the fourth room, - It's intense today.

1851
01:10:06.504 --> 01:10:08.544
there are four brothers.

1852
01:10:08.544 --> 01:10:09.904
- Four brothers? - Brothers?

1853
01:10:09.904 --> 01:10:11.504
-Who are they? - There are four of them.

1854
01:10:11.504 --> 01:10:12.544
Are they four?

1855
01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:14.773
- Why are there so many of them? - I got an idea.

1856
01:10:14.773 --> 01:10:16.513
Did you hear Seok Jin?

1857
01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:17.784
"Why are there so many of them?"

1858
01:10:18.683 --> 01:10:20.183
- Four people. - He's not happy.

1859
01:10:20.713 --> 01:10:21.723
Is it Highlight?

1860
01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.154
They sing well.

1861
01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.364
They are Sweet Sorrow.

1862
01:10:29.824 --> 01:10:31.994
Sweet Sorrow?

1863
01:10:32.633 --> 01:10:33.933
"Sweet Sorrow".

1864
01:10:33.933 --> 01:10:35.263
Why don't you say they are Satellite?

1865
01:10:37.364 --> 01:10:40.603
(Their charming voices liven up the mood.)

1866
01:10:43.444 --> 01:10:44.874
(Don't think too much)

1867
01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:49.044
(I don't care)

1868
01:10:50.383 --> 01:10:52.154
I know who they are, but you don't know.

1869
01:10:52.154 --> 01:10:53.654
- I think I know them. - Who are they?

1870
01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:55.723
Aren't they like brothers to us?

1871
01:10:55.723 --> 01:10:57.023
We became brothers.

1872
01:10:57.023 --> 01:10:59.194
- That's Wanna One. - Wanna One?

1873
01:10:59.194 --> 01:11:01.393
They must be Wanna One then.

1874
01:11:01.494 --> 01:11:03.694
- Is it them? - Are they our brothers?

1875
01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:05.994
- They're our brothers. - It's Wanna One.

1876
01:11:06.494 --> 01:11:07.734
- Really? - Yes.

1877
01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.864
You are going home early today.

1878
01:11:13.874 --> 01:11:17.404
(Bae Jin Young, Kim Jae Hwan, Hwang Min Hyun, Kang Daniel)

1879
01:11:18.343 --> 01:11:20.673
(They are the chosen 11 boys.)

1880
01:11:21.473 --> 01:11:24.414
(They debuted fancily with the song "Energetic".)

1881
01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.853
(They topped all the music charts.)

1882
01:11:29.683 --> 01:11:32.423
(2018 is going to be even a better year for them.)

1883
01:11:33.053 --> 01:11:35.664
They are our brothers.

1884
01:11:35.664 --> 01:11:37.093
(Wanna One comes back to Happy Together.)

1885
01:11:37.963 --> 01:11:39.093
It's Wanna One.

1886
01:11:39.093 --> 01:11:40.133
(He shouts for joy.)

1887
01:11:40.133 --> 01:11:41.294
I am going home first today.

1888
01:11:42.063 --> 01:11:43.463
I think I am going to go home first.

1889
01:11:44.263 --> 01:11:46.834
Wanna One has the advantage.

1890
01:11:46.834 --> 01:11:48.673
- I never expected it to be them. - Seok Jin is unbelievable.

1891
01:11:48.673 --> 01:11:51.173
He wasn't pleased that there were four of them.

1892
01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:52.414
(He made a mistake.)

1893
01:11:53.173 --> 01:11:55.313
- It's too bad only four are here. - He wasn't happy about it.

1894
01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:58.183
They have a great chance of winning today.

1895
01:11:58.183 --> 01:11:59.213
They are most likely to win.

1896
01:11:59.213 --> 01:12:02.053
I was really happy when I became partnered with Wheesung.

1897
01:12:02.353 --> 01:12:03.423
But now...

1898
01:12:04.984 --> 01:12:06.023
Soo Hong.

1899
01:12:06.223 --> 01:12:07.654
I heard...

1900
01:12:07.654 --> 01:12:09.794
the girls always sing my song "Even Thought of Marriage"...

1901
01:12:09.794 --> 01:12:11.994
when they break up with their boyfriend.

1902
01:12:12.093 --> 01:12:13.164
But...

1903
01:12:13.694 --> 01:12:15.063
- Do girls sing that song? - But...

1904
01:12:15.063 --> 01:12:17.404
people might not break up today.

1905
01:12:17.404 --> 01:12:18.603
Wheesung.

1906
01:12:18.773 --> 01:12:20.204
It's a very strange time to break up.

1907
01:12:20.204 --> 01:12:21.874
- We... - It will be...

1908
01:12:21.874 --> 01:12:23.704
- a fight between you two. - We will have to see.

1909
01:12:23.704 --> 01:12:25.513
I was always the last one to leave.

1910
01:12:25.513 --> 01:12:27.713
I will be the first one to leave today.

1911
01:12:27.713 --> 01:12:29.313
I think Seok Jin has a great chance.

1912
01:12:29.313 --> 01:12:30.683
They're coming.

1913
01:12:30.683 --> 01:12:32.284
(Welcome.)

1914
01:12:32.784 --> 01:12:34.984
They're here.

1915
01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:37.053
- Brothers. - Jin Young.

1916
01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:38.994
Brothers.

1917
01:12:38.994 --> 01:12:40.624
Jae Hwan is here too.

1918
01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:42.593
Hello, Kangdan.

1919
01:12:42.593 --> 01:12:43.963
- Jae Hwan. - Good to see you.

1920
01:12:44.164 --> 01:12:45.834
You look amazing today.

1921
01:12:46.534 --> 01:12:49.034
- He's like Inspector Gadget. - Come on in.

1922
01:12:49.834 --> 01:12:51.504
- Welcome. - Welcome.

1923
01:12:51.504 --> 01:12:53.204
Long time no see.

1924
01:12:53.204 --> 01:12:55.603
- Seok Jin. - They are our brothers.

1925
01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:58.303
All their knees are out.

1926
01:12:58.303 --> 01:13:00.473
Right.

1927
01:13:00.473 --> 01:13:02.584
- They are matching. - What?

1928
01:13:02.984 --> 01:13:05.984
We're wearing matching clothes.

1929
01:13:05.984 --> 01:13:07.414
You're all wearing ripped jeans.

1930
01:13:07.414 --> 01:13:09.383
You're Ripped Jeans Brothers.

1931
01:13:09.383 --> 01:13:11.284
Their jeans are moderately ripped.

1932
01:13:11.284 --> 01:13:14.093
- But his jeans are ripped too much. - His is ripped too much.

1933
01:13:14.853 --> 01:13:16.494
We are matching.

1934
01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:18.164
We bonded over these knees.

1935
01:13:18.164 --> 01:13:21.364
- They... - They are so popular now...

1936
01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:24.704
that we are really happy as their brothers.

1937
01:13:24.704 --> 01:13:27.074
- We are trying hard. - This was your first...

1938
01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:28.204
- variety show. - Right.

1939
01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:29.603
You didn't forget us, did you?

1940
01:13:29.603 --> 01:13:31.544
Of course I didn't.

1941
01:13:31.544 --> 01:13:33.813
- Really? - Finally, our brotherhood...

1942
01:13:33.813 --> 01:13:35.313
is paying off.

1943
01:13:35.313 --> 01:13:36.984
Then why don't you call us?

1944
01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:39.353
- Why? - They don't have phones.

1945
01:13:39.353 --> 01:13:41.824
People always talked about how popular they are,

1946
01:13:41.824 --> 01:13:43.484
but they finally have a record to prove their popularity.

1947
01:13:43.484 --> 01:13:46.853
In just 100 days, they became a million seller.

1948
01:13:46.954 --> 01:13:49.563
They sold 500,000 copies. Their fame wasn't just a rumor.

1949
01:13:49.994 --> 01:13:52.534
(They became a million seller with their debut album.)

1950
01:13:52.534 --> 01:13:53.893
We have the record now.

1951
01:13:53.893 --> 01:13:55.504
It's not easy to do these days.

1952
01:13:55.504 --> 01:13:57.834
- It's not easy. - Selling a million copy isn't easy.

1953
01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:58.834
It's an honor.

1954
01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.603
- A million copies? - A million copies were sold.

1955
01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.574
What does this mean, Wheesung?

1956
01:14:02.574 --> 01:14:06.173
When I was at the height of my career...

1957
01:14:06.173 --> 01:14:07.374
Are you all right?

1958
01:14:07.374 --> 01:14:08.813
When I as at the height...

1959
01:14:08.813 --> 01:14:09.813
When you were at the height...

1960
01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:12.683
When I was at the height, I sold 600,000 copies.

1961
01:14:12.683 --> 01:14:14.313
So their record is amazing. Right?

1962
01:14:14.313 --> 01:14:16.084
It's ridiculous. It's like my two album sales combined.

1963
01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.084
A million is a great number.

1964
01:14:17.084 --> 01:14:19.194
How do you feel about this, Min Hyun?

1965
01:14:19.194 --> 01:14:20.324
Isn't that an amazing achievement?

1966
01:14:20.324 --> 01:14:22.923
It's like a dream. It's such a big honor.

1967
01:14:22.923 --> 01:14:25.234
I am really thankful to the fans who love us...

1968
01:14:25.234 --> 01:14:26.864
and to all the people who support us.

1969
01:14:26.864 --> 01:14:28.433
How about you, Jae Hwan?

1970
01:14:28.433 --> 01:14:31.633
You can't count a million using your hands.

1971
01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:32.633
Right.

1972
01:14:33.004 --> 01:14:34.404
It's hard to count using your hands.

1973
01:14:34.404 --> 01:14:37.143
- You couldn't even count 11. - He's adorable.

1974
01:14:37.143 --> 01:14:39.513
He's thankful because he can't count it with his hands.

1975
01:14:39.513 --> 01:14:41.984
- We just debuted. - It's amazing.

1976
01:14:41.984 --> 01:14:43.713
And yet we got so much love.

1977
01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:46.683
All we can think about is how to pay everyone back.

1978
01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:47.853
We are so grateful.

1979
01:14:47.853 --> 01:14:49.523
Their achievements are amazing.

1980
01:14:49.784 --> 01:14:52.353
Min Hyun is dressed like...

1981
01:14:52.353 --> 01:14:54.294
Chow Yun Fat today.

1982
01:14:54.294 --> 01:14:56.194
We would've been cursed at if we wore this.

1983
01:14:56.694 --> 01:14:58.994
I know Min Hyun and Daniel well.

1984
01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.593
But we didn't get to know Jin Young and Jae Hwan.

1985
01:15:00.593 --> 01:15:02.963
We felt bad that we didn't get to spend more time.

1986
01:15:02.963 --> 01:15:05.074
I really wanted to stay,

1987
01:15:05.074 --> 01:15:06.504
- but I couldn't. - I know.

1988
01:15:06.504 --> 01:15:08.234
- You stayed for only a short while. - They only said hi.

1989
01:15:08.234 --> 01:15:11.504
The members were checking the popular search words,

1990
01:15:11.504 --> 01:15:12.973
on the day they were here.

1991
01:15:12.973 --> 01:15:14.614
Weren't you in the list too?

1992
01:15:14.614 --> 01:15:16.013
I wasn't there.

1993
01:15:16.244 --> 01:15:18.114
Who was the most searched person?

1994
01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:19.614
It was Min Hyun.

1995
01:15:19.614 --> 01:15:20.883
It was Min Hyun.

1996
01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:21.984
He was funny.

1997
01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:24.284
- He was. - He talked nonsense.

1998
01:15:24.883 --> 01:15:26.553
- And... - "He talked nonsense."

1999
01:15:26.553 --> 01:15:29.093
Jin Young, do you always have a blank look on your face?

2000
01:15:29.694 --> 01:15:32.834
- No. I think I am nervous. - He's nervous.

2001
01:15:33.633 --> 01:15:34.893
(Before the shoot)

2002
01:15:34.893 --> 01:15:36.803
Are we not allowed to talk to them using honorifics?

2003
01:15:36.803 --> 01:15:38.773
- You have to. - You have to talk with respect.

2004
01:15:38.773 --> 01:15:40.734
But the script is written in informal language.

2005
01:15:40.734 --> 01:15:41.843
It's like that.

2006
01:15:41.843 --> 01:15:43.143
You're such a rookie.

2007
01:15:43.444 --> 01:15:45.813
- Is this your first time? - It's my first time.

2008
01:15:45.813 --> 01:15:47.744
I am a rookie too.

2009
01:15:47.874 --> 01:15:50.183
- Teach me. - Just relax.

2010
01:15:50.813 --> 01:15:52.213
(Laughing)

2011
01:15:52.213 --> 01:15:53.954
But when I'm with the others, I become all timid.

2012
01:15:53.954 --> 01:15:55.254
Right.

2013
01:15:55.824 --> 01:15:57.383
(He can see the future.)

2014
01:15:57.984 --> 01:15:59.494
They treat us really well.

2015
01:15:59.494 --> 01:16:01.494
- The hosts treat us really well. - They do.

2016
01:16:01.963 --> 01:16:05.133
It's easier when there are a lot of experienced ones.

2017
01:16:05.133 --> 01:16:07.234
It's easier for us.

2018
01:16:07.234 --> 01:16:10.164
- They help us a lot. - They react well.

2019
01:16:11.973 --> 01:16:13.973
It's his first time on a variety show.

2020
01:16:15.374 --> 01:16:16.874
We have to treat them well.

2021
01:16:16.874 --> 01:16:19.513
So it's Jin Young's first time to be on a variety show.

2022
01:16:19.513 --> 01:16:22.944
Haven't you been on other variety shows?

2023
01:16:24.183 --> 01:16:26.713
It's my first time on a public TV show.

2024
01:16:26.713 --> 01:16:27.784
(He puts his guard up very high.)

2025
01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:30.154
(Why are they laughing?)

2026
01:16:30.154 --> 01:16:31.523
By the way...

2027
01:16:31.523 --> 01:16:32.694
(They crack up.)

2028
01:16:32.694 --> 01:16:34.494
Ladies,

2029
01:16:34.494 --> 01:16:36.923
it's not that funny though.

2030
01:16:37.063 --> 01:16:38.463
Wasn't it really funny?

2031
01:16:38.633 --> 01:16:40.534
(My stomach hurts.)

2032
01:16:40.664 --> 01:16:43.133
- Sun Mi is still laughing. - I know.

2033
01:16:43.133 --> 01:16:45.074
They laugh whenever Jin Young opens his mouth.

2034
01:16:45.074 --> 01:16:48.034
They crack up every time.

2035
01:16:48.034 --> 01:16:49.074
This is amazing.

2036
01:16:49.074 --> 01:16:51.574
- I love Wanna One so much. - I know.

2037
01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:52.813
Which of the members of Wanna One do you like?

2038
01:16:52.813 --> 01:16:54.114
I like Wanna One as a whole.

2039
01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:56.013
- Not just one person? - What?

2040
01:16:56.013 --> 01:16:58.883
- Who doesn't like Wanna One? - She's good.

2041
01:16:59.813 --> 01:17:01.114
- Hey. - She ended it nicely.

2042
01:17:01.114 --> 01:17:04.454
Why would you get so upset at Seok Jin?

2043
01:17:04.984 --> 01:17:06.723
- Was it so upsetting? - I am sorry.

2044
01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:09.023
Let's see what they think.

2045
01:17:09.023 --> 01:17:12.834
We're in Hongdae. There are other talented singers,

2046
01:17:12.834 --> 01:17:15.133
but we think you have a great chance of winning.

2047
01:17:15.133 --> 01:17:16.263
What do you think about that?

2048
01:17:16.263 --> 01:17:17.603
I think...

2049
01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:20.734
- we have the lowest chance. - Why do you say that?

2050
01:17:20.734 --> 01:17:23.603
Our album just came out.

2051
01:17:23.603 --> 01:17:26.544
My friends don't sing our songs much.

2052
01:17:26.544 --> 01:17:27.944
Really?

2053
01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:31.544
Your album came out only recently, but your songs "Energetic"...

2054
01:17:31.544 --> 01:17:33.954
and "Pick Me" are very popular.

2055
01:17:33.954 --> 01:17:36.053
- Exactly. - We're speaking...

2056
01:17:36.053 --> 01:17:37.654
- from our experience. - Of course.

2057
01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:38.794
Someone always sing your song.

2058
01:17:38.794 --> 01:17:40.223
What do you think, Jae Hwan?

2059
01:17:40.223 --> 01:17:42.194
Which team do you think will get to go home first?

2060
01:17:42.194 --> 01:17:43.963
I think it's going to be Sun Mi.

2061
01:17:43.963 --> 01:17:44.994
(His guess is Sun Mi.)

2062
01:17:45.263 --> 01:17:46.534
- He song "Gashina" is very popular. - It's very popular.

2063
01:17:46.534 --> 01:17:47.933
Since it was already brought up, let me ask you this.

2064
01:17:47.933 --> 01:17:49.904
Who do you think will be the second one to go home?

2065
01:17:49.904 --> 01:17:52.173
- I think... - Be honest.

2066
01:17:52.173 --> 01:17:54.074
I think it's going to be Jin Young.

2067
01:17:54.074 --> 01:17:56.773
- Jin Young. - You and Wheesung...

2068
01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:59.173
must fight for the third place. Who will be the third place?

2069
01:17:59.673 --> 01:18:02.183
It will be us.

2070
01:18:04.414 --> 01:18:05.683
(He gets upset.)

2071
01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:08.254
(I am sorry, Wheesung.)

2072
01:18:08.254 --> 01:18:10.353
- Wait. - They're objective people.

2073
01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:12.494
It's just how he feels.

2074
01:18:12.494 --> 01:18:14.223
It's his personal opinion.

2075
01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:16.063
- Don't be offended. - He revealed his personality.

2076
01:18:16.063 --> 01:18:17.994
He threw the heat pack.

2077
01:18:18.334 --> 01:18:20.194
- It's not a fact. - Yes.

2078
01:18:20.194 --> 01:18:21.563
It's an early symptom.

2079
01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:24.204
What do you think, Jin Young? Who do you think will win?

2080
01:18:24.563 --> 01:18:27.633
I think Wanna One will be the first one to go home.

2081
01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.074
- How about the second? - He's honest.

2082
01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:33.114
I think Sun Mi will be the second one to go.

2083
01:18:33.114 --> 01:18:34.614
- Sun Mi. - How about the third?

2084
01:18:34.914 --> 01:18:36.013
Third.

2085
01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:39.213
Jin Young.

2086
01:18:39.754 --> 01:18:40.853
Hey, watch it.

2087
01:18:41.313 --> 01:18:42.383
Jin Young.

2088
01:18:43.254 --> 01:18:45.124
(That's it. I'm done.)

2089
01:18:46.294 --> 01:18:48.664
We don't know. We don't know what will happen.

2090
01:18:48.664 --> 01:18:50.794
Jin Young,

2091
01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:52.834
it's your first time to be on a public TV show.

2092
01:18:52.834 --> 01:18:56.734
Is a public TV show different from a cable TV show?

2093
01:18:56.734 --> 01:18:58.834
Why does it make you nervous?

2094
01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.744
First of all, a lot of you are on TV often.

2095
01:19:02.744 --> 01:19:05.643
I think he's particularly funny.

2096
01:19:05.643 --> 01:19:06.713
Seok Jin is funny?

2097
01:19:06.713 --> 01:19:09.213
Do you feel starstruck when you see us?

2098
01:19:09.213 --> 01:19:10.813
- Yes. - What are you saying?

2099
01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.084
What's wrong with him?

2100
01:19:15.553 --> 01:19:17.023
Jin Young is starstruck.

2101
01:19:17.023 --> 01:19:19.723
My gosh. Wanna One...

2102
01:19:19.723 --> 01:19:22.124
People go mad about Wanna One.

2103
01:19:22.223 --> 01:19:24.324
And he thinks they are starstruck by him.

2104
01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:25.763
I will give you my autograph.

2105
01:19:25.933 --> 01:19:27.563
He says he will give them his autograph.

2106
01:19:28.734 --> 01:19:30.404
I used to watch "Running Man" a lot.

2107
01:19:30.704 --> 01:19:32.874
- When I watched "Running Man", - He's a "Running Man Kid".

2108
01:19:32.874 --> 01:19:36.204
I found his line hilarious.

2109
01:19:36.874 --> 01:19:39.143
Shoot it right.

2110
01:19:39.143 --> 01:19:40.713
(Laughing)

2111
01:19:41.713 --> 01:19:43.883
Thank you for liking it.

2112
01:19:43.883 --> 01:19:47.183
Shoot it right. Shoot it left.

2113
01:19:47.183 --> 01:19:48.183
(Laughing)

2114
01:19:48.883 --> 01:19:50.883
You like weird stuff.

2115
01:19:50.883 --> 01:19:53.694
Shoot it up. Shoot it back.

2116
01:19:54.654 --> 01:19:56.593
- Jin Young. - It's working.

2117
01:19:56.593 --> 01:19:58.223
You made Jin Young laugh.

2118
01:19:59.063 --> 01:20:01.063
I stopped doing it because it didn't go well.

2119
01:20:01.063 --> 01:20:03.864
He gave up after 2 or 3 weeks.

2120
01:20:03.864 --> 01:20:06.704
Jin Young wanted to look good...

2121
01:20:06.704 --> 01:20:09.843
to the producer and the writers.

2122
01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:13.914
I don't get many opportunities...

2123
01:20:13.914 --> 01:20:15.643
for public variety show.

2124
01:20:15.784 --> 01:20:18.244
It's not easy...

2125
01:20:18.244 --> 01:20:20.284
- like he said. - No.

2126
01:20:20.284 --> 01:20:22.484
I wanted to get to know you too.

2127
01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:24.254
That's why I said that.

2128
01:20:24.683 --> 01:20:26.093
Why are you laughing?

2129
01:20:26.093 --> 01:20:27.223
He's so cute.

2130
01:20:28.194 --> 01:20:29.263
- What's the age gap? - He's cute.

2131
01:20:29.263 --> 01:20:31.263
I'm five years older than him.

2132
01:20:31.263 --> 01:20:32.893
- Is he 18? - He's 18.

2133
01:20:33.164 --> 01:20:35.704
- He's a teenager. - He's only 18?

2134
01:20:35.704 --> 01:20:38.374
- I have a question for Daniel. - Yes.

2135
01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:41.473
- I gave you a nickname Kangdan. - Yes.

2136
01:20:41.473 --> 01:20:42.803
Do your fans call you that?

2137
01:20:42.874 --> 01:20:44.673
Many people call me by that name.

2138
01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.713
- Call you Kangdan. - That's how my mother calls me.

2139
01:20:46.713 --> 01:20:49.143
- Like "Kangdan." - Yes.

2140
01:20:49.813 --> 01:20:52.614
You gave me a good nickname.

2141
01:20:52.813 --> 01:20:54.754
- I'm pleased. - Thank you.

2142
01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:57.723
It's not a problem if it was his intention,

2143
01:20:57.923 --> 01:20:59.923
but it was because he didn't know his name.

2144
01:20:59.923 --> 01:21:02.124
- Kangdan. - Yes. He called him Kangdan.

2145
01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.263
- I didn't know at the time. - Yes.

2146
01:21:04.263 --> 01:21:05.534
- It's very nice. - It wasn't Kang Daniel.

2147
01:21:05.633 --> 01:21:10.164
What do you mean you were shocked on your first appearance, Min Hyun?

2148
01:21:10.164 --> 01:21:11.404
- I wasn't really shocked. - Okay.

2149
01:21:11.404 --> 01:21:12.973
When I came last time,

2150
01:21:13.273 --> 01:21:16.244
- Yong Man danced at the time. - He did.

2151
01:21:16.244 --> 01:21:19.213
- We danced together. - We had a dance battle.

2152
01:21:20.173 --> 01:21:22.383
(They had a dance battle with Wanna One.)

2153
01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:23.744
Pelvis dance.

2154
01:21:24.044 --> 01:21:25.484
(Culture shock)

2155
01:21:25.754 --> 01:21:27.484
(His first variety show was shocking.)

2156
01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:31.124
When I saw him dancing so passionately...

2157
01:21:31.124 --> 01:21:32.923
even though he's a senior,

2158
01:21:33.494 --> 01:21:34.624
I thought I should work harder.

2159
01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:37.294
Yong Man's dance is very funny.

2160
01:21:37.294 --> 01:21:39.334
His dance isn't easy.

2161
01:21:39.334 --> 01:21:41.633
Why don't you do it again for the juniors?

2162
01:21:42.133 --> 01:21:43.904
- Pelvis dance. - Give me a second.

2163
01:21:44.664 --> 01:21:48.173
I can only dance when I'm excited.

2164
01:21:48.173 --> 01:21:50.744
- He can dance to Sun Mi's song. - We don't when we're forced.

2165
01:21:50.874 --> 01:21:52.673
- Yong Man's not picky about song. - How about "Gashina"?

2166
01:21:52.673 --> 01:21:54.914
- He can dance to "Gashina" too. - Of course.

2167
01:21:54.914 --> 01:21:55.984
Does it work on "Gashina"?

2168
01:21:56.343 --> 01:21:57.343
It works on everything.

2169
01:21:57.883 --> 01:21:59.914
Even on traditional Korean songs. It works on everything.

2170
01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:01.513
It works on everything.

2171
01:22:01.654 --> 01:22:03.553
- Traditional Korean songs. - We need to see it.

2172
01:22:03.723 --> 01:22:05.824
It works on traditional songs and rhythm and blues.

2173
01:22:05.824 --> 01:22:07.454
- It works on everything. - Canzone.

2174
01:22:07.454 --> 01:22:09.063
- Canzone. - It works on gospel too.

2175
01:22:09.063 --> 01:22:11.624
Even on rhythm and blues and canzone.

2176
01:22:11.624 --> 01:22:14.534
Samba. It works on African folk music.

2177
01:22:14.534 --> 01:22:16.904
This dance works on any music in the world.

2178
01:22:16.904 --> 01:22:17.963
I want to see it.

2179
01:22:21.133 --> 01:22:22.773
- Why doesn't it play? - He's on.

2180
01:22:22.773 --> 01:22:24.603
The music stopped.

2181
01:22:24.603 --> 01:22:25.843
(He's getting excited.)

2182
01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:30.343
This works too.

2183
01:22:30.343 --> 01:22:31.513
Min Hyun's on the way.

2184
01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.353
This works too.

2185
01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:36.284
He's cute.

2186
01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:37.284
(They have fantastic chemistry.)

2187
01:22:38.893 --> 01:22:40.254
He has steps.

2188
01:22:40.294 --> 01:22:41.294
There are steps in his dance.

2189
01:22:42.523 --> 01:22:44.694
(Daring moves)

2190
01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:46.593
Jin Young's on the way.

2191
01:22:46.593 --> 01:22:47.893
Applause for them please.

2192
01:22:47.893 --> 01:22:50.204
Jin Young's in. Let's get it.

2193
01:22:52.633 --> 01:22:53.633
(What?)

2194
01:22:54.173 --> 01:22:55.173
Look at them.

2195
01:22:56.673 --> 01:22:58.574
That's it.

2196
01:22:58.574 --> 01:22:59.843
Have a conversation.

2197
01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:01.074
Twist your body.

2198
01:23:01.074 --> 01:23:03.484
- You try it, Jae Hwan. - Jae Hwan's joining.

2199
01:23:03.713 --> 01:23:06.254
- Welcome, Jae Hwan. - Clap.

2200
01:23:07.183 --> 01:23:08.883
(Flapping)

2201
01:23:09.353 --> 01:23:11.324
- It's hilarious. - Good job.

2202
01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:13.694
- Keep the moves going. - Now,

2203
01:23:13.694 --> 01:23:15.694
- stop it. - Daniel, jump in.

2204
01:23:15.794 --> 01:23:17.494
- Stop it. - Why?

2205
01:23:17.494 --> 01:23:19.063
- Why? - It's good, but...

2206
01:23:19.063 --> 01:23:20.794
- Don't stop me. - I...

2207
01:23:20.864 --> 01:23:24.063
Come back in. It looked like Yong Man's 70's birthday.

2208
01:23:25.973 --> 01:23:28.103
- Thank you. - Everyone was dancing...

2209
01:23:28.234 --> 01:23:29.273
here.

2210
01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:32.343
- Jin Young showed clicking. - What's that?

2211
01:23:32.343 --> 01:23:34.374
He did this.

2212
01:23:34.374 --> 01:23:35.513
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

2213
01:23:36.213 --> 01:23:37.744
(He's refreshing.)

2214
01:23:38.484 --> 01:23:40.284
We have someone famous for being cute over there.

2215
01:23:40.284 --> 01:23:41.824
Right. Cuteness battle.

2216
01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:43.984
She's the final boss.

2217
01:23:44.223 --> 01:23:46.393
- Let's have Jin Young send... - We have two Jin Young.

2218
01:23:46.393 --> 01:23:48.223
cuteness to Jin Young.

2219
01:23:48.393 --> 01:23:50.393
She'll respond back. Jin Young versus Jin Young.

2220
01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:52.133
- Let's try it. - Cuteness battle.

2221
01:23:52.164 --> 01:23:53.463
- Let me start first. - Okay.

2222
01:23:53.463 --> 01:23:55.133
Imagine you're sending a text.

2223
01:23:55.763 --> 01:23:56.763
Okay.

2224
01:23:57.334 --> 01:23:58.673
- I'll begin. - Okay.

2225
01:23:58.904 --> 01:23:59.973
"I'll begin."

2226
01:24:00.133 --> 01:24:01.133
Start.

2227
01:24:01.874 --> 01:24:03.603
- What was that? - That's cute.

2228
01:24:03.643 --> 01:24:04.973
- That's cute. - That's cute.

2229
01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:06.914
- He's cute. - It's his first time on public TV.

2230
01:24:06.914 --> 01:24:07.944
"Start."

2231
01:24:08.074 --> 01:24:09.643
- It's his first variety show. - I'll start.

2232
01:24:09.643 --> 01:24:13.414
- Start. - Goodness.

2233
01:24:13.414 --> 01:24:14.414
(Cute message is sent.)

2234
01:24:14.414 --> 01:24:16.484
It's sent. You have a new message.

2235
01:24:17.183 --> 01:24:18.183
You.

2236
01:24:20.194 --> 01:24:21.624
Respond it with a click.

2237
01:24:22.763 --> 01:24:24.364
(He cheers.)

2238
01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:26.633
What?

2239
01:24:27.263 --> 01:24:28.404
(18-year-old Jin Young's innocent charm)

2240
01:24:28.404 --> 01:24:29.763
- He loves it. - We've talked about it before.

2241
01:24:29.763 --> 01:24:31.563
Wheesung's Jin Young's fan,

2242
01:24:31.803 --> 01:24:33.803
but she's Wanna One's fan.

2243
01:24:34.004 --> 01:24:36.244
Who's your favorite?

2244
01:24:36.244 --> 01:24:37.244
Is it among these four?

2245
01:24:37.244 --> 01:24:39.574
I like Daniel.

2246
01:24:41.173 --> 01:24:43.513
- I like Kangdan... - Yes.

2247
01:24:43.513 --> 01:24:46.883
because I asked him for a favor before.

2248
01:24:46.883 --> 01:24:48.213
What did you ask?

2249
01:24:48.254 --> 01:24:50.984
My cousin is a huge fan.

2250
01:24:51.254 --> 01:24:53.353
She told the family that...

2251
01:24:53.353 --> 01:24:56.664
she's not going to study without his autograph.

2252
01:24:56.664 --> 01:24:57.864
"She's not going to study without an autograph."

2253
01:24:57.864 --> 01:24:59.364
- She's in middle school. - Middle schooler.

2254
01:24:59.364 --> 01:25:00.534
- That's possible. - So...

2255
01:25:00.534 --> 01:25:05.334
I asked him for his autograph and a video for her.

2256
01:25:05.334 --> 01:25:08.904
- And then? - It probably wasn't easy...

2257
01:25:08.904 --> 01:25:11.973
- since he doesn't know her, - You must have felt bad.

2258
01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:13.973
but he was willing to do it.

2259
01:25:13.973 --> 01:25:16.444
How about her? Is she studying hard?

2260
01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:17.643
She's studying very hard.

2261
01:25:17.643 --> 01:25:19.114
- Really? - Yes.

2262
01:25:19.454 --> 01:25:21.683
- She's studying really hard. - You saved her.

2263
01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:22.683
I'm grateful.

2264
01:25:22.683 --> 01:25:24.553
I was so grateful.

2265
01:25:24.553 --> 01:25:26.154
It made me become his fan even more.

2266
01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:27.494
(She was touched by Daniel's kind heart.)

2267
01:25:27.494 --> 01:25:30.324
- I see. - You've seen many people like her.

2268
01:25:30.423 --> 01:25:31.593
- Like who? - You gave many autographs.

2269
01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:32.763
- To me? - Yes.

2270
01:25:32.763 --> 01:25:34.463
- Like him? - Yes.

2271
01:25:34.534 --> 01:25:35.864
I had so many.

2272
01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:38.164
All of a sudden.

2273
01:25:38.164 --> 01:25:40.673
- As if he suddenly remembered. - He was sitting far back.

2274
01:25:40.874 --> 01:25:41.874
"I had so many."

2275
01:25:42.374 --> 01:25:44.803
They're all going to university, right?

2276
01:25:44.803 --> 01:25:47.513
It reminds me of the legendary time I've forgotten.

2277
01:25:47.513 --> 01:25:48.513
Right.

2278
01:25:48.614 --> 01:25:50.744
- I had so many. - You help them get into SNU.

2279
01:25:50.883 --> 01:25:53.683
Many people studied hard because of Wheesung.

2280
01:25:53.683 --> 01:25:55.254
- Yes. - Of course.

2281
01:25:55.254 --> 01:25:57.154
Usually people dream of becoming a singer when they love a singer,

2282
01:25:57.154 --> 01:25:58.494
but you made them study.

2283
01:25:58.494 --> 01:26:00.093
(When they're with Wheesung, they get better grades.)

2284
01:26:00.093 --> 01:26:02.263
- Goodness. - He made them study.

2285
01:26:02.263 --> 01:26:04.593
- By the way, - Yes.

2286
01:26:04.593 --> 01:26:06.864
Kangdan danced "Gashina" on a show before, right?

2287
01:26:06.864 --> 01:26:08.504
(Kang Daniel's "Gashina" dance)

2288
01:26:08.504 --> 01:26:10.234
- Really? - I...

2289
01:26:10.234 --> 01:26:13.334
respect her a lot.

2290
01:26:13.574 --> 01:26:15.874
Did you see him dancing to "Gashina"?

2291
01:26:15.874 --> 01:26:17.004
Yes. I saw the whole thing.

2292
01:26:17.273 --> 01:26:19.414
- No. - Wanna One danced...

2293
01:26:19.513 --> 01:26:21.414
- "No." - No.

2294
01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:24.244
Did you go on a diet...

2295
01:26:24.244 --> 01:26:26.114
with Wonder Girls' "Tell Me" dance...

2296
01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:27.984
- when you were in middle school? - What is that?

2297
01:26:27.984 --> 01:26:30.654
- What? - It was so popular at the time.

2298
01:26:30.723 --> 01:26:32.593
I learned taekwondo at the time.

2299
01:26:32.593 --> 01:26:34.124
We danced "Tell Me" in taekwondo.

2300
01:26:34.593 --> 01:26:35.763
How?

2301
01:26:35.763 --> 01:26:38.494
We danced after the training camp.

2302
01:26:38.494 --> 01:26:41.734
"Tell Me" was popular throughout the country.

2303
01:26:41.734 --> 01:26:44.164
Oh, for the last part as a warm up?

2304
01:26:44.164 --> 01:26:47.504
- Even police danced to it. - Many people did it.

2305
01:26:47.504 --> 01:26:49.044
People posted many videos of it.

2306
01:26:49.044 --> 01:26:51.673
The whole country had "Tell Me" fever.

2307
01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.643
- You two should dance together. - Yes.

2308
01:26:53.643 --> 01:26:55.643
- Do it together. - Let's see it then.

2309
01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.013
- Thank you. - Sure.

2310
01:26:57.244 --> 01:26:58.713
This "Tell Me" is...

2311
01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:01.383
- memorable. - It's an honor.

2312
01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:03.423
- It's legendary "Tell Me". - This is awesome.

2313
01:27:03.754 --> 01:27:05.893
- They're going to dance to it. - It's been...

2314
01:27:06.994 --> 01:27:09.864
(The woman with irresistible charm)

2315
01:27:11.494 --> 01:27:14.063
(The man that Korea goes wild for)

2316
01:27:14.864 --> 01:27:16.963
(Sun Mi and Kang Daniel)

2317
01:27:18.773 --> 01:27:21.374
(We'll take over this year again.)

2318
01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:24.074
(Fantastic instant collaboration)

2319
01:27:24.603 --> 01:27:26.343
(This is worth saving.)

2320
01:27:26.813 --> 01:27:27.813
They're special.

2321
01:27:27.813 --> 01:27:29.643
(Load a fan bullet.)

2322
01:27:29.643 --> 01:27:31.114
(Shoot.)

2323
01:27:33.484 --> 01:27:34.513
They're good.

2324
01:27:34.654 --> 01:27:35.723
(Next up is a cover dance.)

2325
01:27:35.723 --> 01:27:37.553
He's very pure.

2326
01:27:37.954 --> 01:27:39.124
He's smiling brightly.

2327
01:27:41.864 --> 01:27:43.794
- He's good. - Good job.

2328
01:27:43.794 --> 01:27:45.763
Good job.

2329
01:27:45.763 --> 01:27:48.633
(Good job.)

2330
01:27:49.763 --> 01:27:51.063
Applause please.

2331
01:27:51.563 --> 01:27:52.633
(People of 2018's beautiful collaboration stage)

2332
01:27:52.633 --> 01:27:54.933
- Thank you. - That was good. It was nice.

2333
01:27:54.933 --> 01:27:58.143
- Can Jae Hwan do it alone? - Go for it.

2334
01:27:58.143 --> 01:28:00.273
- At the time... - He's up.

2335
01:28:00.273 --> 01:28:02.544
- Room One's singing "Love Battery". - He's cute.

2336
01:28:02.544 --> 01:28:04.414
- Really? - Where?

2337
01:28:04.414 --> 01:28:05.683
- Room One. - Really?

2338
01:28:05.683 --> 01:28:06.954
Are they singing?

2339
01:28:06.984 --> 01:28:08.284
Oh, Jae Hwan.

2340
01:28:08.284 --> 01:28:11.694
(Jae Hwan's buried by Room 1.)

2341
01:28:11.694 --> 01:28:14.853
- He was going to dance. - "Love Battery"?

2342
01:28:14.954 --> 01:28:17.324
- Really? - It's playing.

2343
01:28:17.324 --> 01:28:19.633
- It's up. - I can't believe it.

2344
01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.433
- Is she off? - Wait.

2345
01:28:21.433 --> 01:28:22.633
- We haven't started it. - Listen to him.

2346
01:28:22.633 --> 01:28:24.404
Let's watch his dance.

2347
01:28:24.404 --> 01:28:25.633
(He's discarded.)

2348
01:28:26.473 --> 01:28:28.643
- Jae Hwan... - We haven't started yet.

2349
01:28:28.643 --> 01:28:30.273
(It doesn't count if it's on before the game.)

2350
01:28:30.273 --> 01:28:31.504
- Look. - That's fast.

2351
01:28:31.504 --> 01:28:35.044
You never know if it'll be Wanna One or Sun Mi or Wheesung.

2352
01:28:35.383 --> 01:28:37.343
"Love Battery" is up already.

2353
01:28:37.414 --> 01:28:40.254
Is she going home now then?

2354
01:28:40.414 --> 01:28:41.553
- What? - Is she going home?

2355
01:28:41.553 --> 01:28:43.254
- It's not started yet. - It's not started yet.

2356
01:28:43.254 --> 01:28:44.254
- Yes! - I see.

2357
01:28:44.624 --> 01:28:45.624
Sit down.

2358
01:28:45.624 --> 01:28:46.923
- Jae Hwan. - Suddenly he asked...

2359
01:28:46.923 --> 01:28:48.794
- if she's going home. - Yes.

2360
01:28:48.794 --> 01:28:49.864
(Finally, it's my turn.)

2361
01:28:49.864 --> 01:28:51.223
- It seems he's... - He's funny.

2362
01:28:51.223 --> 01:28:53.664
- Good luck. - the sad one.

2363
01:28:53.664 --> 01:28:55.633
- Don't be nervous. - He has no change of expression.

2364
01:28:55.633 --> 01:28:57.234
- Right. - Don't be nervous.

2365
01:28:57.234 --> 01:28:58.473
- Just once. - He's cute.

2366
01:28:58.473 --> 01:29:00.133
- He's cute. - Tell me

2367
01:29:00.273 --> 01:29:01.334
That's good.

2368
01:29:01.433 --> 01:29:03.273
- That's good. - That's all you need to know.

2369
01:29:03.273 --> 01:29:05.074
- That's enough. - That's cool.

2370
01:29:05.143 --> 01:29:06.914
- You only get one chance, Jae Hwan. - You're doing good.

2371
01:29:06.914 --> 01:29:08.244
- You can do it, Jae Hwan. - Start.

2372
01:29:08.244 --> 01:29:09.843
- That's cool. - Do it freely.

2373
01:29:09.914 --> 01:29:11.614
(Sun Mi's watching.)

2374
01:29:12.254 --> 01:29:14.454
(He goes as he learned.)

2375
01:29:14.454 --> 01:29:15.523
Good job.

2376
01:29:15.523 --> 01:29:16.523
(Infinite poking)

2377
01:29:16.523 --> 01:29:17.883
That's right. He's poking.

2378
01:29:17.883 --> 01:29:18.923
That's good.

2379
01:29:18.994 --> 01:29:19.994
Applause.

2380
01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:21.694
He's doing it.

2381
01:29:22.563 --> 01:29:24.263
That's enough.

2382
01:29:25.563 --> 01:29:27.694
(He doesn't care. He keeps dancing.)

2383
01:29:27.694 --> 01:29:29.603
- Hey. - Good job.

2384
01:29:30.034 --> 01:29:31.734
- He'll be on the internet hit list. - He danced in his own style.

2385
01:29:31.734 --> 01:29:33.404
- He was so cute. - He looked cute from behind.

2386
01:29:33.404 --> 01:29:35.404
Sun Mi, I'm curious about something.

2387
01:29:35.404 --> 01:29:38.244
Do you want Wonder Girls' songs to be accepted or not?

2388
01:29:38.244 --> 01:29:39.574
- I don't want them to be accepted. - Of course they're accepted.

2389
01:29:39.643 --> 01:29:41.273
- You'll exclude the songs? - Hang on.

2390
01:29:41.273 --> 01:29:43.084
- Only her solo songs are valid. - Why did you say that?

2391
01:29:43.084 --> 01:29:45.353
- You were a member of Wonder Girls. - Okay.

2392
01:29:45.654 --> 01:29:48.484
- I just... - I've been in the same situation.

2393
01:29:49.023 --> 01:29:50.523
- He got traumatized. - Right.

2394
01:29:50.523 --> 01:29:52.624
Lee Seok Hoon of SG Wannabe made the same mistake.

2395
01:29:52.624 --> 01:29:55.994
- Wonder Girls' songs would be... - They're great songs.

2396
01:29:55.994 --> 01:29:58.593
- a big advantage. - You performed the songs. Why?

2397
01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:00.034
- She's giving it up. - That's right.

2398
01:30:00.034 --> 01:30:01.093
- Sun Mi. - Yes?

2399
01:30:01.093 --> 01:30:02.763
Will you exclude "Tell Me", "So Hot", and "Nobody"?

2400
01:30:02.763 --> 01:30:05.173
(Will she exclude Wonder Girls' songs?)

2401
01:30:05.173 --> 01:30:06.803
(Please say no.)

2402
01:30:07.004 --> 01:30:08.074
Yes.

2403
01:30:08.074 --> 01:30:09.074
(She said yes without hesitating.)

2404
01:30:09.074 --> 01:30:11.173
Why would you do that? I'm worried.

2405
01:30:11.173 --> 01:30:12.513
I'm so frustrated.

2406
01:30:12.513 --> 01:30:14.773
- However, my team... - It's a big advantage.

2407
01:30:14.773 --> 01:30:17.044
will include "It's Me", the song they sang before their debut.

2408
01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:18.143
- Min Hyun. - They'll include the song.

2409
01:30:18.143 --> 01:30:19.614
Will you include "It's Me" or not?

2410
01:30:20.183 --> 01:30:23.223
- Include the song. - Since our senior singer...

2411
01:30:23.223 --> 01:30:25.853
excluded her old group's songs, I think we should do the same.

2412
01:30:26.393 --> 01:30:27.754
- What's wrong with you? - Will you exclude "It's Me"?

2413
01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:30.093
- We'll exclude the song. - You'll exclude "It's Me"?

2414
01:30:30.093 --> 01:30:31.093
(It's shocking.)

2415
01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:33.734
- That's good. - Will you really exclude "It's Me"?

2416
01:30:33.734 --> 01:30:35.664
- We'll exclude "It's Me"? - Will you exclude "It's Me"?

2417
01:30:36.103 --> 01:30:38.933
Let's vote. Raise your hand if you agree to exclude "It's Me".

2418
01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.074
1, 2, 3.

2419
01:30:40.433 --> 01:30:42.773
- I knew it. - They don't agree to that.

2420
01:30:42.773 --> 01:30:44.244
(The team is divided.)

2421
01:30:44.244 --> 01:30:46.244
- Only two agree to that. - We can tell who are practical.

2422
01:30:46.244 --> 01:30:48.883
Jae Hwan is blinking slowly.

2423
01:30:48.883 --> 01:30:50.343
He seems to wonder why they should exclude the song.

2424
01:30:50.683 --> 01:30:53.213
Since Wheesung is the other guests' senior singer...

2425
01:30:53.213 --> 01:30:54.383
and has much pride,

2426
01:30:54.383 --> 01:30:56.883
he wants to include the songs he made for other singers as well.

2427
01:30:56.883 --> 01:30:58.154
That's not acceptable.

2428
01:30:58.694 --> 01:31:00.454
- You can't do that. - He can't?

2429
01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:01.763
- They don't count. - Why not?

2430
01:31:01.763 --> 01:31:03.723
- The songs he made... - Only the songs they sang count.

2431
01:31:03.723 --> 01:31:06.133
The songs he made for other singers don't count.

2432
01:31:06.334 --> 01:31:07.633
- Make them valid. - The songs that feature me...

2433
01:31:07.633 --> 01:31:09.704
- Why would you include them? - Tell him yourself.

2434
01:31:09.704 --> 01:31:11.563
- You can't do that. - Wheesung...

2435
01:31:11.563 --> 01:31:13.673
The songs I sang, the songs that feature me,

2436
01:31:13.673 --> 01:31:14.834
and the songs I made.

2437
01:31:14.834 --> 01:31:17.973
- What songs did you make, Wheesung? - That's all.

2438
01:31:18.303 --> 01:31:19.574
- "Heaven". - He made a lot of songs.

2439
01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:21.513
- "Heaven" by Ailee. - I see.

2440
01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.013
"Heaven" and...

2441
01:31:23.013 --> 01:31:25.383
So you will go when people sing "Heaven"?

2442
01:31:25.883 --> 01:31:27.683
- What's wrong about that? - He's unbelievable.

2443
01:31:27.683 --> 01:31:30.223
- The songs are like his children. - I can't believe him.

2444
01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:31.954
- It's a female singer's song. - Don't be so harsh.

2445
01:31:31.954 --> 01:31:33.794
- Isn't that weird? - He'll sing the song?

2446
01:31:33.794 --> 01:31:36.664
Imagine that Wheesung walks in while singing Ailee's song.

2447
01:31:36.664 --> 01:31:39.393
- The song is like his own child. - Sun Mi, let's include...

2448
01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:42.263
only the songs that you sang. That would look better.

2449
01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:43.504
- That'd be simpler. - Jin Young will...

2450
01:31:43.504 --> 01:31:45.834
- "Gashina" is on the list. - Now...

2451
01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:47.374
- That's great. - "Gashina".

2452
01:31:47.374 --> 01:31:49.773
- Is it not on the list? - They booked "Gashina".

2453
01:31:49.773 --> 01:31:51.773
- The next song is "Gashina". - They booked "Gashina".

2454
01:31:51.773 --> 01:31:54.473
- They booked "Gashina". - They booked "Gashina".

2455
01:31:54.973 --> 01:31:56.614
- They booked "Gashina". - That's a relief.

2456
01:31:56.614 --> 01:32:01.614
(Time heals pain, but I'm getting weaker and weaker)

2457
01:32:01.614 --> 01:32:03.654
- That was quick. - "Gashina".

2458
01:32:03.654 --> 01:32:07.023
- "Gashina" is booked already. - From my experience on this show,

2459
01:32:07.023 --> 01:32:10.364
the singers whose songs were booked before the game began...

2460
01:32:10.364 --> 01:32:12.133
- mostly came in 3rd and 4th. - There is a jinx.

2461
01:32:12.133 --> 01:32:14.763
So I predict that Jin Young and Sun Mi will come in 3rd and 4th.

2462
01:32:14.763 --> 01:32:17.133
You predict that Wanna One or...

2463
01:32:17.133 --> 01:32:20.303
- Wheesung will win today. - I think they'll be the top two.

2464
01:32:20.973 --> 01:32:22.244
- Do you think so? - Yes.

2465
01:32:23.374 --> 01:32:24.544
He's happy.

2466
01:32:25.614 --> 01:32:28.584
Wheesung seems to have mood swings often.

2467
01:32:29.084 --> 01:32:31.484
- He's a typical emotional type. - He has emotional ups and downs.

2468
01:32:31.484 --> 01:32:32.484
He's a typical type.

2469
01:32:33.013 --> 01:32:35.984
There's great news about Daniel.

2470
01:32:35.984 --> 01:32:38.593
He's been chosen as one of the three most influential people in Korea.

2471
01:32:39.124 --> 01:32:42.794
President Moon Jae In is one of them.

2472
01:32:42.794 --> 01:32:45.334
Daniel has proudly been chosen as well.

2473
01:32:45.334 --> 01:32:48.093
- That's too much. - This is...

2474
01:32:48.334 --> 01:32:49.904
- That's not necessary. - Right.

2475
01:32:49.904 --> 01:32:50.963
- That's... - Really?

2476
01:32:50.963 --> 01:32:54.273
And excessive compliments like that would put pressure on him.

2477
01:32:54.273 --> 01:32:56.773
Daniel must be happy. Min Hyun, how do you feel?

2478
01:32:56.773 --> 01:32:57.944
Did you heard this news?

2479
01:32:58.473 --> 01:33:00.244
When I heard the news,

2480
01:33:00.244 --> 01:33:03.944
I realized how much Daniel is loved by people.

2481
01:33:04.343 --> 01:33:07.813
We're on the same team, but I admire him.

2482
01:33:08.313 --> 01:33:10.124
- You admire him? - Admire?

2483
01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:13.223
- Min Hyun. - He used to be your team member,

2484
01:33:13.223 --> 01:33:16.023
- but the news made you admire him. - That's too much.

2485
01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.463
- I understand. - Look.

2486
01:33:17.463 --> 01:33:18.694
"Love Battery".

2487
01:33:18.694 --> 01:33:21.093
- Really? - I can't believe this.

2488
01:33:21.093 --> 01:33:22.834
- Room 1. - Room 1 booked the song.

2489
01:33:22.834 --> 01:33:24.463
("Love Battery", Hong Jin Young)

2490
01:33:24.463 --> 01:33:27.334
- It's quite different today. - They're singing Jin Young's song.

2491
01:33:27.334 --> 01:33:28.343
("Love Battery", Hong Jin Young)

2492
01:33:28.343 --> 01:33:30.504
- This is the second time. - It's her song again.

2493
01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:31.643
- It's okay. - Now...

2494
01:33:31.643 --> 01:33:34.444
- "Love Battery" is catching up. - The game hasn't begun.

2495
01:33:34.444 --> 01:33:36.744
"Gashina" was booked twice.

2496
01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:38.853
We just had an urgent meeting.

2497
01:33:38.853 --> 01:33:40.553
We decided to include "It's Me".

2498
01:33:41.313 --> 01:33:42.883
(I'm the master of negotiation.)

2499
01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:44.754
Min Hyun, did you yield to him?

2500
01:33:44.754 --> 01:33:46.624
- Our songs haven't been booked. - Right.

2501
01:33:46.624 --> 01:33:48.194
- We'll include "It's Me". - "Energetic" has been booked.

2502
01:33:48.194 --> 01:33:49.494
- You have to include "It's Me". - Of course.

2503
01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:50.994
(This is what happened before.)

2504
01:33:51.563 --> 01:33:52.963
(We're in big trouble.)

2505
01:33:52.963 --> 01:33:54.063
(I think we should include "It's Me".)

2506
01:33:54.933 --> 01:33:56.404
(That's what I said before.)

2507
01:33:57.664 --> 01:33:59.973
