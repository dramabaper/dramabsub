1
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.292
Previously on Return.

2
00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:14.192
The problem for this case...

3
00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:16.802
lies in the initial investigation of the police.

4
00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:19.261
The detective got too deep within his own theory...

5
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.831
and disregarded any evidence that didn't align with his theory.

6
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.642
What do you know? Why are you complaining about the police?

7
00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.202
I simply believe that if a man commits suicide to prove...

8
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.542
that he didn't kill his girlfriend...

9
00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:30.642
even after his death, we should listen.

10
00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:31.742
Do you have anything else to say?

11
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:36.451
I can't stand her.

12
00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:38.422
Do you live here?

13
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:42.252
I'm moving into 302 today.

14
00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:44.822
- I see. - So where do you live?

15
00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:46.532
In 401.

16
00:00:46.532 --> 00:00:47.792
Gosh, we're neighbors.

17
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:49.362
Hi.

18
00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.731
- You must look like your daddy. - Pardon?

19
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:54.002
See you around.

20
00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.341
Why are you here?

21
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:00.542
I told you I was going to move here.

22
00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:01.642
Have you lost your mind?

23
00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:02.911
I told you to call.

24
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.742
I told you not to wait because I had a gathering!

25
00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:06.552
You were so into me before.

26
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:08.712
Are you sick of me now? Is that it?

27
00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:11.481
Don't be like that.

28
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:16.761
Why did you want us to meet?

29
00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:18.121
There's no particular reason.

30
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:20.531
Are we expecting another guest?

31
00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:21.932
Let me get that.

32
00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:27.031
In Ho, you have a guest.

33
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:43.981
Mi Jung is dead.

34
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.522
How could this happen?

35
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.662
I was searching for her while investigating a drug case.

36
00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:52.761
But what is this?

37
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:54.292
These are Roman numerals. 99.

38
00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:56.061
- When is the time of death? - There's a sign of the corpse...

39
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.231
being refrigerated.

40
00:01:58.102 --> 00:01:59.102
Did you find something?

41
00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:02.102
He's the only guy who always showed up in the parking lot...

42
00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:05.141
30 minutes after Yum Mi Jung checked into the hotel.

43
00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:08.211
(Episode 3)

44
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:15.652
(Order Information of the Purchaser, Name: Kang In Ho)

45
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:16.722
"Kang In Ho".

46
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.421
It's creepy how all evidence is pointing at him.

47
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.192
Get me his home address as quickly as possible.

48
00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:28.632
I'm on it.

49
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.801
(Gangdong Precinct)

50
00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:10.502
I'm with the police.

51
00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:12.002
Hi, what brings you here?

52
00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:14.241
Is Mr. Kang In Ho home?

53
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:16.741
May I ask what this is about?

54
00:03:20.412 --> 00:03:21.412
Mr. Kang In Ho?

55
00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.852
- Yes. - You are under arrest...

56
00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:25.852
for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum Mi Jung.

57
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.722
Wait. Hold on.

58
00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:32.822
What... What is he talking about?

59
00:03:36.632 --> 00:03:37.632
Could I...

60
00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:42.402
talk to my wife in private for a moment, please?

61
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:45.342
I'll give you five minutes.

62
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.442
Explain it to me. Why are you suspected of murder?

63
00:03:52.412 --> 00:03:54.782
You don't know Mi Jung on a personal level.

64
00:03:55.282 --> 00:03:56.782
Well, that's...

65
00:03:57.981 --> 00:03:59.081
Wait, did you...

66
00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:00.752
Honey.

67
00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:04.322
Please just believe in me. I'm sure this is nothing.

68
00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:06.391
Don't believe what others say about me.

69
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.491
Please listen to only me, and believe in me.

70
00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:11.461
I'll be back before you know it. Okay?

71
00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:13.102
Bye.

72
00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.381
Put your muscles into good use.

73
00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:07.022
Why don't you help?

74
00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:08.691
Is that why you look familiar?

75
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:11.921
I thought for a second that she was In Ho's ex-lover.

76
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:17.231
I don't think I'm In Ho's type.

77
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.032
Tell us.

78
00:05:21.472 --> 00:05:22.972
What do you think of me?

79
00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:25.301
You're definitely not my type.

80
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:27.871
You're vulgar, do whatever you want,

81
00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:31.181
and delude yourself that you can charm guys...

82
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:32.441
with such qualities.

83
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:56.871
My goodness, what brings you here at this hour?

84
00:05:56.871 --> 00:05:58.972
Please excuse my manners. Is Tae Suk home?

85
00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:01.712
Honey.

86
00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:03.912
Tae Suk.

87
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:05.912
What is it? Why are you calling me?

88
00:06:07.712 --> 00:06:08.712
What is this about?

89
00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:10.782
Can we talk in private for a moment?

90
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:13.522
In somewhere quiet.

91
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:14.691
What could you...

92
00:06:15.352 --> 00:06:17.861
possibly talk about without me?

93
00:06:19.022 --> 00:06:21.532
- Let's go to Joon Hee's. - Honey, honey.

94
00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:36.642
Have you two...

95
00:06:37.342 --> 00:06:39.311
known Mi Jung before our dinner by any chance?

96
00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:40.352
No.

97
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:44.981
Please answer my question, Joon Hee.

98
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:47.491
You knew her, didn't you?

99
00:06:49.962 --> 00:06:51.621
You should hear it from In Ho.

100
00:06:51.892 --> 00:06:54.431
I agree. You should let In Ho explain about that.

101
00:06:54.631 --> 00:06:56.301
But tell me what's going on first.

102
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:58.762
Why are you asking me this question? Any why do you look anxious?

103
00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:01.671
Did something happen to In Ho?

104
00:07:05.142 --> 00:07:07.171
A detective came to our house a little while ago.

105
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:14.912
He arrested In Ho as a suspect for the murder of Mi Jung.

106
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:24.361
What should I do?

107
00:07:27.292 --> 00:07:28.292
That can't be possible.

108
00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:31.001
There's no reason In Ho would murder her.

109
00:07:35.431 --> 00:07:36.472
What I meant was...

110
00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:39.871
that In Ho can't be the murderer.

111
00:07:40.712 --> 00:07:42.371
But why did the detective arrest him?

112
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:43.582
There must have been a misunderstanding.

113
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:45.712
So you must act with composure.

114
00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:48.782
Don't tell his parents now.

115
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.981
First, find him an attorney.

116
00:07:51.121 --> 00:07:54.121
I'm sure you probably know more about that than me.

117
00:07:54.522 --> 00:07:57.522
Someone who is competent and you can trust.

118
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:14.912
How did you get those scratches on your face?

119
00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:17.611
I... I got scratched by a cat.

120
00:08:19.952 --> 00:08:22.051
You got scratched by a cat.

121
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:24.751
What is your relationship with Ms. Yum Mi Jung?

122
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:26.551
We are friends.

123
00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:29.051
"Friends"?

124
00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:32.522
My gosh, that must be nice.

125
00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:35.931
So you go to a hotel suite 4 or 5 times a month with a friend.

126
00:08:36.502 --> 00:08:37.532
Right?

127
00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:50.941
Keep it together, Na Ra.

128
00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:53.351
Think.

129
00:08:54.882 --> 00:08:58.152
Let's think.

130
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:00.321
Let's think.

131
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:03.091
Oh, no.

132
00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:11.362
Mommy. What's wrong?

133
00:09:13.331 --> 00:09:14.471
What are you doing?

134
00:09:32.721 --> 00:09:34.752
(Choi Ja Hye)

135
00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:39.561
Mommy. What's wrong?

136
00:09:53.642 --> 00:09:56.112
Hey, Dokgo. Did you find anything?

137
00:09:56.882 --> 00:09:57.882
No.

138
00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:01.912
Everyone claims the right to remain silent. Where did they learn that?

139
00:10:02.112 --> 00:10:05.181
Where else? They must've learned it from dramas.

140
00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:11.691
Did you get the DNA sample?

141
00:10:11.892 --> 00:10:14.461
- Yes. I just sent it to NFS. - Okay.

142
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.801
Anyway, this will be a headache if the media finds out.

143
00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:21.272
Kang In Ho is Taeha Group's sole heir.

144
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:24.872
My goodness. These people lack nothing,

145
00:10:24.872 --> 00:10:26.772
but they are having affairs and committing murder.

146
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:28.242
Gosh.

147
00:10:30.982 --> 00:10:34.051
Keep your mouth shut. Don't run your mouth.

148
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:40.122
I may not always speak the truth, but I don't run my mouth.

149
00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:47.762
Dal Rae.

150
00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:52.632
From now on, that lady you met earlier,

151
00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:54.301
will pick you up after kindergarten.

152
00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:58.042
You can come pick me up.

153
00:10:58.242 --> 00:11:00.612
Mommy's going to get a little busy from now on,

154
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:06.711
so I won't be able to spend as much time with you anymore. Sorry.

155
00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:09.782
No.

156
00:11:11.152 --> 00:11:12.252
Come here.

157
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:21.792
The times create crime,

158
00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:24.532
and people create justice. We highlighted cases...

159
00:11:24.532 --> 00:11:26.801
that are consistent with that statement.

160
00:11:27.032 --> 00:11:29.502
There was a case in which protecting the human rights...

161
00:11:29.502 --> 00:11:31.801
of the offender resulted in being inconsiderate...

162
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:35.441
to the victim or the victim's family when they deserved to be consoled.

163
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:38.482
There was a case in which crimes weren't punished because...

164
00:11:38.482 --> 00:11:40.782
the offender was young or mentally weak.

165
00:11:41.112 --> 00:11:45.252
All citizens of Korea have a duty to protect the law.

166
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:49.691
However, the law must come after the moral of the law.

167
00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:51.762
A law that we can accept.

168
00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:53.762
A law that exists within reason.

169
00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:56.262
That is the world I dream of.

The 12-week series has come to an end.

172
00:12:01.532 --> 00:12:04.471
I will see you again in Season Three.

173
00:12:04.642 --> 00:12:05.801
I wish you happiness.

174
00:12:07.671 --> 00:12:08.711
Cut!

175
00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:15.711
- Thank you. - Thank you.

176
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:35.431
What brings you here?

177
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:38.471
It's good to have you here. I was going to call you anyway.

178
00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:41.512
Ja Hye. I need your help.

179
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:51.652
Hey! Dokgo! Dokgo!

180
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:52.921
Dokgo!

181
00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:55.752
- What? - Do you know who's here?

182
00:12:55.752 --> 00:12:57.522
Did the police commissioner come or something?

183
00:12:57.522 --> 00:13:01.732
Why would I freak out about the police commissioner?

184
00:13:01.732 --> 00:13:03.632
You talk so big.

185
00:13:03.632 --> 00:13:06.061
You'd fall to the ground if you saw the police commissioner.

186
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:08.732
So? Who's here?

187
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:25.982
Are you okay?

188
00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:35.331
- We meet again. - Hello.

189
00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.232
Are you in charge of the case?

190
00:13:38.232 --> 00:13:39.402
Yes, well...

191
00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:42.272
I'm Kang In Ho's attorney, Choi Ja Hye.

192
00:13:45.571 --> 00:13:46.612
Sure.

193
00:13:48.242 --> 00:13:50.341
May I see my client?

194
00:13:56.181 --> 00:13:59.282
I didn't get to introduce myself properly last time.

195
00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:00.451
Are you...

196
00:14:01.321 --> 00:14:03.721
I'm your attorney.

197
00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:07.691
- Did Na Ra hire you? - Yes.

198
00:14:09.762 --> 00:14:11.032
Is she okay?

199
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:21.112
It may take some time.

200
00:14:21.112 --> 00:14:22.471
Will you keep standing there?

201
00:14:23.242 --> 00:14:25.012
Am I interrupting you?

202
00:14:25.012 --> 00:14:26.752
No, I don't think so, but...

203
00:14:27.282 --> 00:14:29.821
I'm sure you won't be helpful.

It is?

00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:50.701
You really aren't helpful.

208
00:14:51.742 --> 00:14:53.841
If you have nothing to do, would you make me some coffee?

209
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:57.142
So you want me to leave you alone.

210
00:14:57.811 --> 00:14:59.012

211

That's the day Yum Mi Jung went missing.

219
00:15:34.982 --> 00:15:38.351
He had his wife and mistress together at the dinner table.

220
00:15:39.282 --> 00:15:42.792
Once they finished dinner, he went to the riverside park.

221
00:15:45.122 --> 00:15:46.262
Okay.

Why did you go...

226
00:15:58.142 --> 00:15:59.502
to Han River that day?

227
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:01.711
I went there to break up.

228
00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:04.841
Mi Jung started getting too obsessive with me.

229
00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:08.482
Why did you decide to break up with her that day?

230
00:16:10.482 --> 00:16:14.721
The day we all ate together, she intentionally made it risky.

231
00:16:23.662 --> 00:16:26.331
Are you insane? Get up. Now.

232
00:16:26.872 --> 00:16:27.971
Seriously.

233
00:16:28.232 --> 00:16:30.341
I just want to see your bedroom.

234
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.742
You said a cheap woman like me isn't your type.

235
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:38.482
Just because we're alone in this room,

236
00:16:38.482 --> 00:16:40.482
your wife won't get the wrong idea.

237
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:42.282
Get up while I'm being nice.

238
00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:46.451
Hey.

239
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:48.622
This is so comfortable.

240
00:16:49.152 --> 00:16:52.221
So which side do you sleep on?

241
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:53.331
What?

242
00:16:53.892 --> 00:16:57.902
The inside? Or the outside?

243
00:16:58.762 --> 00:17:02.632
Or do you look at your wife when you sleep like this?

244
00:17:02.632 --> 00:17:05.242
- Hey. - No. No, don't tell me.

245
00:17:06.202 --> 00:17:08.272
I think it'll upset me if I know.

246
00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:13.311
Get out of my house right now.

247
00:17:13.682 --> 00:17:15.452
Make an excuse, and get out.

248
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:19.422
Fine. Let's meet after dinner.

249
00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:22.051
Really?

250
00:17:22.422 --> 00:17:25.361
Can we really meet after dinner?

251
00:17:25.692 --> 00:17:26.692
Yes.

252
00:17:29.601 --> 00:17:31.432
Hey. Are you insane?

253
00:17:31.932 --> 00:17:33.502
Hey. Stop it.

254
00:17:47.551 --> 00:17:49.682
Why did you go to the bathroom in the middle of dinner?

255
00:17:51.782 --> 00:17:54.292
- You don't like my food? - No, no.

256
00:17:56.321 --> 00:17:58.661
- Did you see Mi Jung? - What?

257
00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:01.561
No, I didn't.

258
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:02.962
Did she go to the bathroom?

259
00:18:05.331 --> 00:18:07.432
My goodness. I'm terribly sorry.

260
00:18:08.532 --> 00:18:11.772
I had to talk to the bar about a shipment.

261
00:18:11.772 --> 00:18:13.141
Is there a problem?

262
00:18:13.772 --> 00:18:15.871
It isn't good news.

263
00:18:16.442 --> 00:18:18.182
I'll have to go first.

264
00:18:18.782 --> 00:18:19.782
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:22.111
Don't be.

266
00:18:22.252 --> 00:18:24.881
You weren't invited anyway.

267
00:18:26.292 --> 00:18:27.522
Bye, Na Ra.

268
00:18:27.522 --> 00:18:29.252
Don't worry about us, and go.

269
00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:32.891
Okay then. Enjoy yourselves.

270
00:18:33.992 --> 00:18:35.161
My jacket, please.

271
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:47.442
Bye.

272
00:18:48.371 --> 00:18:49.611
My gosh.

273
00:18:56.182 --> 00:18:58.121
I couldn't tolerate Mi Jung.

274
00:18:58.422 --> 00:19:01.821
I can't tolerate anyone who is a threat...

275
00:19:02.022 --> 00:19:03.091
to my family.

276
00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:04.792
That's interesting.

277
00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:07.232
You wanted to protect...

278
00:19:07.962 --> 00:19:11.502
your family, but your affair had been going on for a year.

279
00:19:13.702 --> 00:19:15.532
I apologize if I have offended you.

280
00:19:15.672 --> 00:19:17.772
I can't help but side with Na Ra.

281
00:19:19.871 --> 00:19:21.272
According to the police case file,

282
00:19:21.272 --> 00:19:24.512
you have scratches you might've gotten from a fight with the victim.

283
00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:29.151
The fight must have been quite intense.

284
00:19:31.821 --> 00:19:35.391
According to the police report, you made a statement that you got...

285
00:19:35.391 --> 00:19:36.462
scratched by a cat.

286
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:39.161
I said it impulsively.

287
00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:41.462
I was scared after being suddenly arrested.

288
00:19:41.732 --> 00:19:46.432
Your skin debris has been found under Ms. Yum Mi Jung's fingernails.

289
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:49.871
This is the report of the DNA test.

290
00:19:50.702 --> 00:19:51.841
(DNA Test Report)

291
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:54.512
(The DNA found under the victim's nails match with the suspect's.)

292
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:56.782
It means you cannot lie.

293
00:19:56.911 --> 00:19:58.811
To me or to the detectives.

294
00:19:58.811 --> 00:20:00.551
When they ask you difficult questions,

295
00:20:00.712 --> 00:20:02.581
it's better to exercise your right to remain silent.

296
00:20:05.321 --> 00:20:08.121
All right. Let's start with the fight.

297
00:20:08.222 --> 00:20:09.252
Okay.

298
00:20:10.161 --> 00:20:12.061
When I told her some harsh words to break up with her,

299
00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:14.131
she slapped me in the face out of nowhere.

300
00:20:14.432 --> 00:20:18.061
Hey. You're just... Well, you're a toilet.

301
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:19.672
You're like a toilet.

302
00:20:19.672 --> 00:20:21.601
I can let it out whenever I want,

303
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:23.002
and if I don't need it, I just close...

304
00:20:38.452 --> 00:20:41.151
How could you do this to me?

305
00:20:48.762 --> 00:20:49.962
I was angry and hated her,

306
00:20:50.432 --> 00:20:52.202
but I couldn't just leave her there.

307
00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:55.702
She wasn't a woman I could break up like that.

308
00:20:59.002 --> 00:21:00.571
Where did you go after that?

309
00:21:05.442 --> 00:21:06.982
The appraised value of the land here...

310
00:21:07.411 --> 00:21:09.482
is 1 of the 10 highest values in Korea.

311
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:12.952
Where do you hear all this nonsense from?

312
00:21:13.051 --> 00:21:14.621
My dream is becoming an owner of a building.

313
00:21:15.952 --> 00:21:18.091
On the night Yum Mi Jung supposedly disappeared,

314
00:21:18.091 --> 00:21:20.192
they came here from the Han River riverside park.

315
00:21:20.692 --> 00:21:23.661
He went home after staying here for an hour.

316
00:21:23.661 --> 00:21:25.131
Then that means...

317
00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:29.172
that all we need is the evidence that he came here with her.

318
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:31.101
That's correct.

319
00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:53.732
Ms. Choi, how did the interview with Mr. Kang go?

320
00:21:55.432 --> 00:21:59.002
He at least didn't look like he was dumb enough to abandon the body...

321
00:21:59.002 --> 00:22:02.732
in a designer suitcase that had its own serial number on the street.

322
00:22:04.101 --> 00:22:05.371
Oh, right. The street.

323
00:22:06.942 --> 00:22:08.542
I rushed here to tell you this.

324
00:22:10.012 --> 00:22:11.042
Here you go.

325
00:22:11.311 --> 00:22:12.311
Did you look into this?

326
00:22:12.782 --> 00:22:14.081
Yes, but...

327
00:22:28.492 --> 00:22:32.732
There's a surveillance camera on this four-lane highway here,

328
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:36.702
but there is no surveillance camera on this one-way street,

329
00:22:36.702 --> 00:22:38.871
where the suitcase with the body was found.

330
00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:43.111
They didn't consider putting one as the road goes into the village.

331
00:22:43.381 --> 00:22:45.581
Well, I put the surveillance footage...

332
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:47.952
in the USB I just handed to you.

333
00:22:48.982 --> 00:22:50.851
That won't be enough, right?

334
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:53.722
I think there might be a way.

335
00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:19.881
I think we can ask the people over there.

336
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:21.212
Where are you going?

337
00:23:22.611 --> 00:23:26.292
It's a big mistake if you think everyone...

338
00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:27.821
is charmed by you.

339
00:23:27.922 --> 00:23:29.762
Senior citizens over 65...

340
00:23:29.762 --> 00:23:33.432
favor someone cute, tiny, and pretty like me.

341
00:23:33.692 --> 00:23:37.462
To be honest, they wouldn't be keen on someone tall like you.

342
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:38.932
I'll be back.

343
00:23:43.772 --> 00:23:45.742
Hello, everyone.

344
00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:49.172
My goodness, it's cold today, so everyone is here.

345
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:53.012
Ma'am, what are you doing? It looks like it's fun.

346
00:23:53.012 --> 00:23:54.952
We're playing cards. Join the game, and sell your cards.

347
00:23:57.881 --> 00:23:59.992
- My goodness. - This young lady can drink.

348
00:23:59.992 --> 00:24:02.492
- Drink, drink. - Look at her.

349
00:24:02.492 --> 00:24:03.992
- My goodness. - Unbelievable.

350
00:24:04.292 --> 00:24:05.391
This is nice.

351
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:08.292
By the way, what brings you here?

352
00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:12.401
Are you all close with your neighbors?

353
00:24:12.432 --> 00:24:14.401
- Of course. - You bet.

354
00:24:15.202 --> 00:24:16.401
Then do you...

355
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:19.611
still know everything that happens with your neighbors?

356
00:24:19.611 --> 00:24:22.542
That's how things were when I was young and visited my grandparents'.

357
00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:25.712
But I don't think it's still like that these days, right?

358
00:24:25.712 --> 00:24:28.212
- It's still the same. - She's right.

359
00:24:28.212 --> 00:24:32.151
Then I'm sure you can probably recognize cars from out of town.

360
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:35.121
- Isn't it obvious? Of course. - That's easy.

361
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:38.292
- Then let's take a look at this. - What is it?

362
00:24:38.292 --> 00:24:39.321
- What is it? - Look at this, please.

363
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:41.792
- See if you recognize any cars. - Let me see.

364
00:24:45.301 --> 00:24:47.932
- You passed it. It's Soo Boon's. - That one.

365
00:24:47.932 --> 00:24:49.672
- I passed it? - Yes.

366
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:52.472
- Is this it? - Yes, that's the one.

367
00:24:52.772 --> 00:24:54.111
- That's Soo Boon's. - This truck?

368
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:56.071
- Yes, that belongs to Soo Boon. - Soo Boon?

369
00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:57.942
- This is Soo Boon's? - Yes.

370
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:12.992
Hello, sir.

371
00:25:13.032 --> 00:25:15.061
May we ask you a few questions?

372
00:25:16.702 --> 00:25:17.962
Sir,

373
00:25:18.601 --> 00:25:21.101
could you please spare us some time?

374
00:25:21.432 --> 00:25:22.432
What is this about?

375
00:25:22.672 --> 00:25:24.871
Do you have a dash cam...

376
00:25:24.871 --> 00:25:26.911
on the truck parked out in front of your cattle farm?

377
00:25:27.212 --> 00:25:28.772
Of course I do.

378
00:25:37.722 --> 00:25:39.381
"I caught a fish."

379
00:25:39.692 --> 00:25:41.692
"See? I told you."

380
00:25:46.492 --> 00:25:48.992
Mommy, please keep going.

381
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:52.561
Dal Rae, Mommy needs to take this call. It's important.

382
00:25:52.561 --> 00:25:53.871
Please give me a minute, okay?

383
00:25:57.172 --> 00:25:59.942
A little fairy wants to play

384
00:25:59.942 --> 00:26:01.442
Rain, rain

385
00:26:01.442 --> 00:26:02.982
Go away

386
00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:04.512
Rain, rain

387
00:26:04.512 --> 00:26:05.512
- Go away - Yes, Ja Hye.

388
00:26:05.581 --> 00:26:07.051
Hello. Can you talk?

389
00:26:07.311 --> 00:26:08.512
Yes, I can.

390
00:26:09.182 --> 00:26:10.282
How is it going?

391
00:26:10.621 --> 00:26:12.551
I can't tell you anything in particular now,

392
00:26:12.551 --> 00:26:14.051
and I needed to check something.

393
00:26:14.722 --> 00:26:15.851
Okay. Please go on.

394
00:26:15.992 --> 00:26:20.032
Do you remember anything about Mr. Kang's schedule on December 4th?

395
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:24.101
He went to inspect a factory in Yeoju in the morning...

396
00:26:24.101 --> 00:26:26.272
and probably had a meeting on the site in the afternoon.

397
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:27.901
Are you sure?

398
00:26:27.972 --> 00:26:30.502
Yes, I'm sure. I packed him a bag and sent him off.

399
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:33.641
You can probably find some photos on the company's website too.

400
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:35.611
Okay.

401
00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:37.111
(Taeha Group)

402
00:26:38.641 --> 00:26:41.782
(Inspection of Yeoju Factory and Employee Meeting, December 4)

403
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:43.482
Okay, thank you.

404
00:26:43.982 --> 00:26:45.022
Well...

405
00:26:45.821 --> 00:26:48.292
Can't you tell me how it's going?

406
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:50.161
I can't talk about it now,

407
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:53.262
but I will tell you more when we have some good news.

408
00:27:04.702 --> 00:27:06.672
Let's skip over unimportant parts.

409
00:27:07.172 --> 00:27:08.772
Let's talk about the scratches on your face.

410
00:27:09.881 --> 00:27:12.911
Why did you lie that you got scratched by a cat?

411
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:25.762
The DNA found under Mi Jung's fingernails match with your DNA.

412
00:27:25.762 --> 00:27:27.091
Well, that's because...

413
00:27:28.992 --> 00:27:30.601
When they ask you difficult questions,

414
00:27:30.861 --> 00:27:32.702
it's better to exercise your right to remain silent.

415
00:27:35.772 --> 00:27:37.002
Did your attorney tell you...

416
00:27:37.901 --> 00:27:39.141
that you should remain silent?

417
00:27:41.512 --> 00:27:42.672
Do whatever you want.

418
00:27:43.611 --> 00:27:46.081
I understand. Lovers get into fights too.

419
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:48.182
When you're in a fight, you exchange a few punches too.

420
00:27:48.182 --> 00:27:49.881
So where did you two fight?

421
00:27:51.782 --> 00:27:52.782
Do you not remember?

422
00:27:55.121 --> 00:27:56.121
Then should I tell you?

423
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:58.462
It was in your car.

424
00:28:00.591 --> 00:28:02.131
I'm pretty sure...

425
00:28:02.331 --> 00:28:05.161
you took Mi Jung to Han River after the dinner that night.

426
00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:14.512
Even after a violent fight, I doubt anyone saw what happened.

427
00:28:15.042 --> 00:28:18.442
Why? Because it was raining, and not many people were around.

428
00:28:19.682 --> 00:28:23.222
But she was still alive after you and she had a fight.

429
00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:26.952
You killed her somewhere else.

430
00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:31.621
Stellarium Penthouse.

431
00:28:32.692 --> 00:28:35.161
Get my attorney. I want my attorney!

432
00:28:36.432 --> 00:28:37.462
Call my attorney.

433
00:28:47.742 --> 00:28:50.081
It's too late for a visit.

434
00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:51.341
You should know better.

435
00:28:51.341 --> 00:28:54.851
I'm sure I came right on time. Let's talk.

436
00:29:06.762 --> 00:29:10.631
You apparently don't want to sit with me for too long,

437
00:29:10.631 --> 00:29:12.801
so I'll get right to it.

438
00:29:13.672 --> 00:29:15.272
The body was found...

439
00:29:16.371 --> 00:29:17.472
on the road in Paju.

440
00:29:17.472 --> 00:29:19.542
Sadly, there are no cameras there.

441
00:29:19.542 --> 00:29:21.442
There may be no CCTVs,

442
00:29:21.742 --> 00:29:24.341
but, the road to the town is a one-way street,

443
00:29:24.482 --> 00:29:27.811
so it's different from side roads that people take frequently.

444
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:31.051
This photo was taken at an intersection...

445
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:33.391
that has cameras.

446
00:29:33.692 --> 00:29:36.661
If you want to enter the road that the body was found,

447
00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:39.692
you must pass through this intersection.

448
00:29:41.131 --> 00:29:44.002
That's why I checked all the cars...

449
00:29:44.002 --> 00:29:46.232
that passed through this intersection...

450
00:29:47.131 --> 00:29:50.341
before the body was found.

451
00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:56.482
I showed pictures of the cars to the elderly residents,

452
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:02.512
and they pointed to this car.

453
00:30:06.321 --> 00:30:09.121
Two hours before the body was found,

454
00:30:09.121 --> 00:30:13.391
at exactly 8:28pm, it passed through the same road.

455
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:19.532
And at exactly 10:20pm, the body was found.

456
00:30:22.401 --> 00:30:23.972
Of course Kang In Ho...

457
00:30:24.942 --> 00:30:26.871
has an alibi for that time.

458
00:30:26.871 --> 00:30:29.242
I'll submit evidence tomorrow morning as well.

459
00:30:29.242 --> 00:30:31.881
Okay. How about this?

460
00:30:32.542 --> 00:30:34.811
In order to establish his alibi,

461
00:30:34.811 --> 00:30:37.452
he had someone else to dump the body at that time.

462
00:30:38.452 --> 00:30:40.821
What? It's possible.

463
00:30:41.252 --> 00:30:43.222
People will even commit murder for money these days.

464
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:44.821
It's not a crime...

465
00:30:44.821 --> 00:30:47.262
to dump a body on a road with no cameras.

466
00:30:47.462 --> 00:30:49.561
A man calculating enough...

467
00:30:49.561 --> 00:30:52.762
to hire someone to dump the body and create an alibi...

468
00:30:52.762 --> 00:30:55.131
put the body into a designer bag with a unique serial number,

469
00:30:55.131 --> 00:30:57.301
that is as identifiable as your fingerprints,

470
00:30:57.301 --> 00:31:00.071
and dumped it on a road that the townspeople take?

471
00:31:01.012 --> 00:31:03.141
You're saying my client did that?

472
00:31:03.141 --> 00:31:06.551
Exactly. I thought that was strange as well, to be honest.

473
00:31:06.752 --> 00:31:07.952
Why did he do that?

474
00:31:09.051 --> 00:31:11.651
It's too careless to say it was a mistake.

475
00:31:14.492 --> 00:31:16.962
Okay, then. Since you threw a jab at me,

476
00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:18.722
I'll counter with a hook.

477
00:31:20.792 --> 00:31:23.331
Do you know the Stellarium Villa in Cheongdam-dong?

478
00:31:23.661 --> 00:31:25.361
It's quite famous.

479
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:26.601
So you do know.

480
00:31:26.932 --> 00:31:29.002
That villa is very interesting.

481
00:31:29.601 --> 00:31:33.212
One of the top 10 villas in all of Korea...

482
00:31:33.212 --> 00:31:35.311
has only three cameras.

483
00:31:35.742 --> 00:31:37.381
At the entrance,

484
00:31:37.381 --> 00:31:40.182
in the elevator, and at the garage entrance.

485
00:31:40.182 --> 00:31:42.151
Stop beating around the bush.

486
00:31:42.151 --> 00:31:43.452
Then do you know...

487
00:31:43.452 --> 00:31:45.321
who lives in the penthouse...

488
00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:47.252
that takes up the entire top floor of the building?

489
00:31:51.391 --> 00:31:52.492
Kang In Ho.

490
00:31:54.692 --> 00:31:57.301
It's not strange that the sole heir of Taeha Group...

491
00:31:57.301 --> 00:32:00.131
owns a luxurious second home.

492
00:32:01.672 --> 00:32:04.742
What's strange is that immediately before Yum Mi Jung went missing,

493
00:32:04.742 --> 00:32:07.571
she was caught on camera in that villa.

494
00:32:09.682 --> 00:32:13.381
What? You didn't know?

495
00:32:14.012 --> 00:32:16.381
Did he say they went their separate ways at the Han River?

496
00:32:16.682 --> 00:32:17.821
My gosh.

497
00:32:18.121 --> 00:32:21.522
You'll have to flip the tables or reset it.

498
00:32:22.022 --> 00:32:24.121
Just because she was caught on camera...

499
00:32:24.121 --> 00:32:26.432
isn't proof that he murdered her.

500
00:32:26.732 --> 00:32:29.962
They were caught entering together,

501
00:32:30.502 --> 00:32:32.601
but Kang In Ho left alone an hour later.

502
00:32:33.702 --> 00:32:35.972
That means Yum Mi Jung should be at the penthouse,

503
00:32:35.972 --> 00:32:38.601
but not on a road in Paju.

504
00:32:39.002 --> 00:32:42.111
Was that the only bag he had that was big enough...

505
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:43.442
to fit a body or something?

506
00:32:47.551 --> 00:32:50.252
If you have something else to say, why don't we go elsewhere?

507
00:32:50.252 --> 00:32:52.821
There's a nice drip coffee place nearby...

508
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:55.051
I'll buy coffee another time.

509
00:32:55.452 --> 00:32:59.292
I see you haven't found a smoking gun either.

510
00:32:59.292 --> 00:33:01.361
If you want to challenge me, you need solid evidence...

511
00:33:01.361 --> 00:33:03.262
rather than circumstantial evidence.

512
00:33:03.432 --> 00:33:06.272
For example, a video of Kang In Ho...

513
00:33:06.932 --> 00:33:09.532
moving the bag.

514
00:33:18.542 --> 00:33:20.952
It feels like I'm losing for some reason.

515
00:33:22.712 --> 00:33:25.222
How is this any different from solid evidence?

516
00:33:35.232 --> 00:33:36.861
Don't you have anything to tell me?

517
00:33:38.432 --> 00:33:41.432
Like something you can't bear to say out loud?

518
00:33:41.732 --> 00:33:43.801
- What are you doing? - Exactly.

519
00:33:46.141 --> 00:33:48.071
Why am I here?

520
00:33:48.242 --> 00:33:49.311
What...

521
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:51.982
How much can I believe you...

522
00:33:51.982 --> 00:33:54.911
No. How much must I believe you?

523
00:33:56.452 --> 00:33:58.922
If the trust between an attorney and client is broken,

524
00:33:58.922 --> 00:34:00.591
it's impossible to win that trial.

525
00:34:00.722 --> 00:34:03.792
Look. You're not making any sense.

526
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:06.492
Where did you last see Yum Mi Jung?

527
00:34:12.031 --> 00:34:16.741
Did you think there was a secret that you could keep forever?

528
00:34:21.072 --> 00:34:22.982
I'll ask you once again.

529
00:34:23.911 --> 00:34:26.482
- Did you kill Yum Mi Jung? - No!

530
00:34:26.482 --> 00:34:28.382
How can I believe you?

531
00:34:28.382 --> 00:34:31.351
Then leave! There are plenty of lawyers out there.

532
00:34:31.351 --> 00:34:33.721
That's right. There are plenty of lawyers out there.

533
00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:35.152
If any of them...

534
00:34:35.351 --> 00:34:39.422
have a win rate as high as I do, go ahead.

535
00:34:40.292 --> 00:34:41.292
Wait.

536
00:34:47.471 --> 00:34:48.531
Darn it!

537
00:34:57.555 --> 00:35:00.955
(Episode 4 will air shortly.)
